	How are you feeling, Harry?
	And you told us that you spent some time with Parkinson and Zabini, so you’re also on good terms with his friends.
	Of course, Madam.
	Let’s end early. It is Friday.
	Sleep well, okay, Harry?
	Harry, what’s gotten in to you?
	If it gets bad, we can take you to the Infirmary.
	And not due to a certain Slytherin you were obsessed with during sixth year?
	No, we can’t. Do your little thing with Malfoy, then.
	Harry, you’re almost late!
	It’s Malfoy, isn’t it? I heard you had a Seeker’s game with him this morning.
	Enough Quidditch. Library. Work.
	I got your message. What’s wrong?
	Harry? Are you ready to tell us?
	Harry? We’ll always be your friends, regardless.
	You’ve been a lot happier lately, and you’ve stopped sneaking out at night.
	Yes, we knew. But the point is, soon after you stopped, you started taking breakfast in the kitchens.
	I think the Dursleys are the kind of people who are homophobic and they probably told you blatantly wrong information.
	It’s okay if you’re gay, or bisexual, Harry. We’ll still love you. We’ll still be friends.
	And you’re on first-name basis.
	Glad to be so interesting
	Ginny, what’s wrong? What happened?
	Yet I’m the one intended to give you heirs.
	I—I think it’s called agoraphobia.
	Something about—about open spaces makes me panic.
	I don’t know. It’s not like it’s rational.
	It’s probably from being in that cell for so long.
	There was nothing—It was like a void. Everyone was dead. No one was going to come for me. I was just there, and I didn’t even know how long it had been.
	I don’t know. I suppose my horror exceeded my fear.
	I just bled.
	The cell was kept clean, but there was nothing provided.
	I think that you are evil and inhuman.
	The feeling is decidedly mutual.
	I suppose your master was quite pleased with you.
	What is it?
	My brain feels cold. What did you do to me?
	It feels like I’m dead.
	You’re being different to me now. You’re less mean. Why are you even doing this for me?
	Are you reading my mind?
	Well, this has all been very illuminating. I won’t disturb your reading further.
	I’m Hermione Granger, this is Ron Weasley and Draco Malfoy. I’m afraid you’re in tremendous danger. We’re here to help.
	Harry, please, listen to me.
	The same thing happened to me. To all of us.
	If you’d like, we can tell you more — and there’s something you should know, Harry. There are people after you.
	And they’re you, and you’re right here.
	Besides us. Besides us, Harry, you know what we’re talking about. You can feel it, can’t you?
	That went well. He told us where he worked!
	There are loads of theories about it.
	Is there somewhere we can go, Harry?
	Malfoy, the Statute.
	I’m afraid it might take more than that.
	Oh, dear. May as well come out and say it, shall we? Harry, you’re a wizard.
	Some think maybe the Muggles who raised you managed it somehow, like they emigrated to somewhere unreachable, and somehow the magical trace was disrupted.
	Well, you’re in terrible danger, Harry.
	You were under some sort of protection when you still lived with your family, so long as you were under seventeen.
	It’s not a secret.
	We don’t say it out loud.
	Well done, Harry.
	We’ll teach him.
	Oh, I was thinking we’d probably track him for a while until something goes terribly wrong.
	What? You saw him?
	Oh, honestly. You'd think they'd have a bit more sense.
	I said I believed you, didn't I? Now, what do you need help with?
	No. But it might offer a new perspective. Would you mind if I accessed the memory?
	You know I won't.
	Have you visited Eeylops?
	Oh. Tea's getting cold.
	Anyway. This is a start. What do you think it means?
	Maybe he was getting it resized because of recent weight loss.
	A law used to exist, stating that those who knew the whereabouts of felons, but didn't report them straight away, could be arrested for hindering prosecution.
	I didn't finish the question.
	Yes. You do that, and come and tell us all about it.
	Maybe you should have asked Malfoy where he is, then.
	You've had dreams of real events before, Harry.
	From what you said, the cliffs were treacherous.
	Do you think he was depressed at all?
	Well, I'd better be going. Let me know if you have any new leads.
	This sounds familiar. Remember when you told me about your dreams, a while ago?
	An exceptional Legilimens can construct visions, hallucinations.
	Was it stress?
	Will they just reset it… after?
	What will you be learning, exactly?
	As bad as you’ve had it from them, you know how horribly they’ve treated me since back in first year.
	Can you really blame me for being worried?
	Please be careful, Harry.
	I really should be going, Harry; I feel like I’m shirking my responsibilities as prefect. Can we meet up tomorrow?
	Let’s meet in the library.
	We’re not actually going to use any magic in Defense Against the Dark Arts.
	She’s refusing to teach any of the practical work.
	She said that learning the theory should be enough to help us pass our O.W.L.s.
	How could Dumbledore allow this to happen?
	She’s a terrible teacher, and we’re never going to pass our O.W.L.s, and I’m not going to get a good job after leaving Hogwarts.
	It’s clearly propaganda!
	I don’t think you know, but it looked so strange from the perspective of anyone who wasn’t you.
	You just appeared with Cedric’s body, saying that You-Know-Who was back, but there wasn’t any proof.
	We’ll figure out something. We always do.
	It’s so odd without you there, Harry. I think everyone misses you.
	Ginny and I were talking at lunch today how strange it was to not have you in the tower.
	Angelina Johnson was having a near-complete breakdown last night.
	She’s not stupid. I think she’s just angry at the situation she’s found herself in.
	I’ve been reading.
	Oh, no. Um. I had a question.
	I don’t know if it’s somehow weird for me to ask this, but I feel like I’m the only person who doesn’t know what’s going on.
	Has Neville and some other boys in Eighth Year grown a lot over the summer?
	I feel like they have, but it seems like I’m the only person confused by it.
	Is that usual?
	Ginny, I don’t know what’s happening to me.
	Was I poisoned?
	I have already been an adult for nearly two years. I’m turning nineteen tomorrow.
	Understood to be a Muggle-born?
	Is there something wrong with me?
	So, I’m a magical broodmare?
	I'm afraid that’s going to have to wait. I am not interested in having children for at least six years.
	Do you mean to say that I need to find someone to shag all week and you’re suggesting I just proposition Neville?
	I don’t want some boy I hardly know having sex with me because I’m in heat.
	Yes. It's over now.
	No. It's not anything like that.
	I don't know what I can do to make it up to him if he feels like I assaulted him.
	I thought that might be the case, based on my reading.
	No. Sorry. It became difficult to focus.
	Flying cars are certainly more terrifying.
	Let's see. Ron is due for a new cauldron. I'd like a new rune set.
	Harry, I have here that you're to get new robes. Maybe we could all meet back at Flourish and Blotts after?
	Ron, you're meeting your mum at Gringotts, don't forget.
	Brooms are not shes, I hate to break it to you.
	Neither Slytherin nor Hufflepuff were damaged as much in the battle.
	Thank you.
	No, apparently. I guess Neville's developed a snoring problem.
	Professor Snape!
	Yes, Professor.
	That's a good point.
	Oh my God, you cannot Apparate in Hogwarts castle!
	Where have you people been studying?
	Take your shoes and socks off, Harry.
	She's right, you know.
	I didn't say it was fair. I only said it was right.
	I need to talk to Professor Sinistra. Meet you in the foyer.
	That can't be right.
	I heard he had to abide the law and all Hogwarts rules.
	I'm guessing he's just working hard to get good marks because he knows how hard it's going to be for him after he leaves here.
	Are you really?
	I've learnt all our set books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough.
	'm Hermione Granger by the way, who are you?
	You're in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts, you know.
	I guess I should be going, now that you found Trevor.
	That sounds like a bad soap opera. Are you sure?
	Well, yes, but you're more likely to know you're name than something that happened over a millennium ago?
	How does your SCAR hurt, Harry?
	Why do you put up with him?
	But he doesn't seem like a very pleasant person.
	Fair enough. Now, what do you mean he supports Death Eaters? As in Voldemort?
	How do they manage to keep from marrying Muggles or half-bloods?
	I mean, there can't be very many proper Pureblood families, can there?
	But what do you mean by 'old family.' Aren't all families equally old?
	I do not! It's just that rules are put into place for our protection and as such we should follow them and not flaunt our disregard for them!
	Why? Because you could have gotten seriously injured; what more reason do I need?
	I suppose I'll have to go to make sure you don't get yourself killed.
	Although for the record, this totally counts as endangering others.
	I've read all about them! You've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking at all, I saw him!
	Okay, I'll bite. If it wasn't Snape, who was cursing your broom?
	Shall we go and have a look at our new room?
	We need to be studying, Ron, and you know it. We missed practically a whole year.
	I really don’t think that’s a good idea.
	You heard Professor McGonagall, we’re meant to be setting a good example to the rest of the school.
	All right. But just this one evening. This is our most important school year, and I want to make the most of it.
	Come on. We’ll be late for our first lesson.
	Oh, let him have it, Petra.
	Mandy, can I see that page again? The one with the chart showing the decline in the Merpeople population?
	We’re just collecting some specimens of the plants growing here.
	It’s not actually for schoolwork.
	It’s just that we’ve got a theory about how the aquatic plant life here might use moonlight to photosynthesise, so we’re taking some samples to check.
	Do you think that’s enough now?
	It turns out Mandy and I have quite a lot in common.
	Daphne’s top of her House in Potions, actually. It’s just nice to have company.
	It must be. Oh well, I guess you can stay out of his way most of the time. Does he say much?
	Are you sleeping any better?
	Of course I am, I’ve got loads to do. But we came out for a quick break. The tea is just to keep warm.
	It was Millicent’s idea, and I have to say it’s quite delicious.
	Let’s go for a walk, then. You too, Harry.
	I’ll see you back in the library in a bit.
