{"prompt":"","completion":" The process had begun in the writing of _The Hobbit,_ in which there were already some references to the older matter: Elrond, Gondolin, the High-elves, and the orcs, as well as glimpses that had arisen unbidden of things higher or deeper or darker than its surface: Durin, Moria, Gandalf, the Necromancer, the Ring."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As is told in The Hobbit, there came one day to Bilbo's door the great Wizard, Gandalf the Grey, and thirteen dwarves with him: none other, indeed, than Thorin Oakenshield, descendant of kings, and his twelve companions in exile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf, however, disbelieved Bilbo's first story, as soon as he heard it, and he continued to be very curious about the ring."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That also Gandalf thought strange and suspicious; but he did not discover the truth in this point for many more years, as will be seen in this book."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After his return to his home he never spoke of it again to anyone, save Gandalf and Frodo; and no one else in the Shire knew of its existence, or so he believed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And look at the outlandish folk that visit him: dwarves coming at night, and that old wandering conjuror, Gandalf, and all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That was Gandalf's mark, of course, and the old man was Gandalf the Wizard, whose fame in the Shire was due mainly to his skill with fires, smokes, and lights."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Inside Bag End, Bilbo and Gandalf were sitting at the open window of a small room looking out west on to the garden."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" said Gandalf, shaking his head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" From the time of Gandalf's arrival he remained hidden from view."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The fireworks were by Gandalf: they were not only brought by him, but designed and made by him; and the special effects, set pieces, and flights of rockets were let off by him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The art of Gandalf improved with age."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And there was also one last surprise, in honour of Bilbo, and it startled the hobbits exceedingly, as Gandalf intended."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The invitations were limited to twelve dozen (a number also called by the hobbits one Gross, though the word was not considered proper to use of people); and the guests were selected from all the families to which Bilbo and Frodo were related, with the addition of a few special unrelated friends (such as Gandalf)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At that moment the door opened and Gandalf came quickly in."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'I am old, Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf looked curiously and closely at him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I want to see mountains again, Gandalf, _mountains,_ and then find somewhere where I can _rest._ In peace and quiet, without a lot of relatives prying around, and a string of confounded visitors hanging on the bell."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" '_ Gandalf laughed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf looked again very hard at Bilbo, and there was a gleam in his eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'No, but I had to badger you,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Yes, yes,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf stood up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf's eyes flashed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then you will see Gandalf the Grey uncloaked.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf's eyes remained bent on the hobbit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'I don't know what has come over you, Gandalf,' he said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'I have never called you one,' Gandalf answered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Then trust mine,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Indeed it would take away the only point I ever saw in the affair,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'No, don't give the ring to me,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Good-bye, Gandalf!'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf remained for a while staring after him into the darkness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Yes,' answered Gandalf, 'he has gone at last.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I think really he preferred slipping off quietly in the end,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'It may, and it may not,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'My dear Gandalf!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" said Gandalf, sitting down."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Which story, I wonder,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'That's interesting,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'So do I,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The blame was mostly laid on Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There were rumours of strange things happening in the world outside; and as Gandalf had not at that time appeared or sent any message for several years, Frodo gathered all the news he could."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was just at this time that Gandalf reappeared after his long absence."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'So do you,' Frodo replied; but secretly he thought that Gandalf looked older and more careworn."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf was thinking of a spring, nearly eighty years before, when Bilbo had run out of Bag End without a handkerchief."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even in the light of morning he felt the dark shadow of the tidings that Gandalf had brought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Last night you began to tell me strange things about my ring, Gandalf,' he said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Bilbo knew no more than he told you, I am sure,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Very wise,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Maybe not,' answered Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'He felt better at once,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'To tell you the truth,' replied Gandalf, 'I believe that hitherto  _hitherto,_mark you  he has entirely overlooked the existence of hobbits."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'It has everything to do with it,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It felt suddenly very heavy, as if either it or Frodo himself was in some way reluctant for Gandalf to touch it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf held it up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Frodo gave a cry and groped for the tongs; but Gandalf held him back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After a while Gandalf got up, closed the shutters outside the window, and drew the curtains."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It is quite cool,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'No,' said Gandalf, 'but I can."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'So do I,' said Gandalf, 'and so do all who live to see such times."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'It was taken from him,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf paused."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'It is true all the same,' replied Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Only too true, I fear,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf sighed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'You ought to begin to understand, Frodo, after all you have heard,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'It is no laughing matter,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf looked at Frodo, and his eyes glinted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'I saw him there,' answered Gandalf, 'but before that he had wandered far, following Bilbo's trail."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Ah,' said Gandalf, 'now we come to it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Yes, to Mordor,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" O Gandalf, best of friends, what am I to do?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'You have not seen him,' Gandalf broke in."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He weighed the Ring in his hand, hesitating, and forcing himself to remember all that Gandalf had told him; and then with an effort of will he made a movement, as if to cast it away  but he found that he had put it back in his pocket."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf laughed grimly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Such questions cannot be answered,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" cried Gandalf, springing to his feet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf sat down again and puffed at his pipe, as if lost in thought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" said Gandalf at last."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Whatever it may do, it will be slow, slow to evil, if you keep it with that purpose,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He did not tell Gandalf, but as he was speaking a great desire to follow Bilbo flamed up in his heart  to follow Bilbo, and even perhaps to find him again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" exclaimed Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf crept to one side of the window."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Lor bless you, Mr. Gandalf, sir!'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'I don't,' said Gandalf grimly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf's eyes flashed and his brows stuck out like bristles."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Suddenly Gandalf laughed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If you don't, if you even breathe a word of what you've heard here, then I hope Gandalf will turn you into a spotted toad and fill the garden full of grass-snakes.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" _Chapter 3_ Three is Company  'You ought to go quietly, and you ought to go soon,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But he did not tell all his thoughts to Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'But you cannot see very far,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But so firmly fixed had the notion of the immeasurable wealth of the Bagginses of Bag End become that most found this hard to believe, harder than any other reason or unreason that their fancy could suggest: to most it suggested a dark and yet unrevealed plot by Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf stayed in the Shire for over two months."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At first Frodo was a good deal disturbed, and wondered often what Gandalf could have heard; but his uneasiness wore off, and in the fine weather he forgot his troubles for a while."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Autumn was well under way before Frodo began to worry about Gandalf again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The next day Frodo became really anxious, and kept a constant look-out for Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Still Gandalf did not appear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The four younger hobbits were, however, in high spirits, and the party soon became very cheerful in spite of Gandalf's absence."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Frodo's party was over, and Gandalf had not come."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Frodo was restless and anxious, listening in vain for a sound of Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After that, if Gandalf wanted him urgently, he would go to Crickhollow, and might even get there first."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He half expected to see Gandalf come striding up through the dusk."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I am going to start, and Gandalf must follow me.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'I wonder if that is Gandalf coming after us,' said Frodo; but even as he said it, he had a feeling that it was not so, and a sudden desire to hide from the view of the rider came over him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And if it is Gandalf,' he added as an afterthought, 'we can give him a little surprise, to pay him out for being so late."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The advice of Gandalf seemed absurd."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'I wish I had waited for Gandalf,' Frodo muttered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'It is,' said Frodo; 'but I thought my going was a secret known only to Gandalf and my faithful Sam.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Has Gandalf told you nothing?'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But if you desire clearer counsel, you should ask Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" These things Gandalf must know."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I have been expecting Gandalf for many days."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'That Gandalf should be late, does not bode well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I think you should now go at once, without delay; and if Gandalf does not come before you set out, then I also advise this: do not go alone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If I take your advice I may not see Gandalf for a long while, and I ought to know what is the danger that pursues me.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But I understand that Gandalf chose me a good companion."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And all those close talks with Gandalf.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I don't know what Gandalf would say."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You are not a very easy nut to crack, and Gandalf is worse."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But I meant no wrong to you, Mr. Frodo, nor to Mr. Gandalf for that matter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We know most of what Gandalf has told you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But I should very much like to see Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I could see that even Gildor was disturbed when he heard that Gandalf had never appeared."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Would it be safe to wait one day for Gandalf?'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Still, I am very glad someone is stopping behind, who can tell Gandalf what you have done, when he turns up, as I am sure he will before long.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'We could not have left any message behind for Gandalf otherwise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But if Fatty is willing to hold the fort, and I can be sure of Gandalf knowing the way we have gone, that decides me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Tell Gandalf to hurry along the East Road: we shall soon be back on it and going as fast as we can.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Indeed so much did Tom know, and so cunning was his questioning, that Frodo found himself telling him more about Bilbo and his own hopes and fears than he had told before even to Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He was perhaps a trifle annoyed with Tom for seeming to make so light of what even Gandalf thought so perilously important."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Frodo was neither very fat nor very timid; indeed, though he did not know it, Bilbo (and Gandalf) had thought him the best hobbit in the Shire."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf would admit that there had been nothing else he could do."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Could it have been Gandalf?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That was Gandalf, if you know who I mean."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Old Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" FRODO BAGGINS, BAG END, HOBBITON in the SHIRE._  'A letter for me from Gandalf!'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And I'm mortal afraid of what Gandalf will say, if harm comes of it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Leaving the letter aside, I promised Gandalf no less."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It seemed certainly to be Gandalf's."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But what can have happened to Gandalf?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Frodo turned and looked at him thoughtfully, wondering about Gandalf's second postscript."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Why didn't you tell me that you were Gandalf's friend at once?'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'They are  at first sight at any rate,' laughed Pippin with sudden relief after reading Gandalf's letter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'How do we know you are the Strider that Gandalf speaks about?'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'You never mentioned Gandalf, till this letter came out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But how did you know that they were in Gandalf's letter, if you have never seen it?'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf will make for that point, if he follows us."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'When did you last see Gandalf?'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The tidings had gone far and wide that Gandalf was missing and the horsemen had been seen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Do you think the Black Riders have anything to do with it  with Gandalf's absence, I mean?'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf is greater than you Shire-folk know  as a rule you can only see his jokes and toys."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'This is a friend of Gandalf's."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Merry was still reading and pondering Gandalf's letter when Strider and Nob returned."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'But surely we were hoping to find Gandalf there?'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If Gandalf was anywhere about, there was no sign of him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And no sign of Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'It might be a sign left by Gandalf, though one cannot be sure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'What could they mean, even if Gandalf made them?'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" asked Merry 'I should say,' answered Strider, 'that they stood for G3, and were a sign that Gandalf was here on October the third: that is three days ago now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'I wonder if old Gandalf has been here,' he said to Pippin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'I was very anxious to find some sign of Gandalf; but it was a mistake for three of us to go up and stand there so long."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'I know only the little that Gandalf has told me,' said Frodo slowly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He did not forget the Barrow, nor the message of Gandalf; but something seemed to be compelling him to disregard all warnings, and he longed to yield."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your Frodo is made of sterner stuff than I had guessed, though Gandalf hinted that it might prove so."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If Gandalf ever came here, then he must have been forced to ride away, and he will not return."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" These must be the very three that were caught by Gandalf, quarrelling over the right way to cook thirteen dwarves and one hobbit.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They were probably following the very track that Gandalf, Bilbo, and the dwarves had used many years before."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Then Gandalf has reached Rivendell?'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They said that the Nine were abroad, and that you were astray bearing a great burden without guidance, for Gandalf had not returned."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `Gandalf!'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" While he was thinking of all these things and trying in vain to bring his memory down to his arriving in Rivendell, there was a long silence, broken only by the soft puffs of Gandalf's pipe, as he blew white smoke-rings out of the window."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Yes, they are all safe and sound,' answered Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You were beginning to fade,' answered Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'You have talked long in your sleep, Frodo,' said Gandalf gently, 'and it has not been hard for me to read your mind and memory."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'I was delayed,' said Gandalf, `and that nearly proved our ruin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'You will soon hear all you wish to know,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Yes, I, Gandalf the Grey,' said the wizard solemnly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf smiled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `You don't know much even about them, if you think old Barliman is stupid,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" cried Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'You have talked and reckoned more than is good for you,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Yes, fortune or fate have helped you,' said Gandalf, `not to mention courage."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf moved his chair to the bedside, and took a good look at Frodo."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `Still that must be expected,' said Gandalf to himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'No,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Elrond commanded it,' answered Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf looked quickly at Frodo, but he had shut his eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `Well, there are many reasons why they should,' said Gandalf, smiling."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf asked me to come and see if you were ready to come down, and I thought he was joking.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" said Gandalf from the shadows at the back of the porch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `Gandalf has been saying many cheerful things like that,' said Pippin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `As soon as Gandalf reported that you were recovered, the preparations began.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elrond, as was his custom, sat in a great chair at the end of the long table upon the dais; and next to him on the one side sat Glorfindel, on the other side sat Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Frodo looked at them in wonder, for he had never before seen Elrond, of whom so many tales spoke; and as they sat upon his right hand and his left, Glorfindel, and even Gandalf, whom he thought he knew so well, were revealed as lords of dignity and power."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf was shorter in stature than the other two; but his long white hair, his sweeping silver beard, and his broad shoulders, made him look like some wise king of ancient legend."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But perhaps I should not inquire too closely, since Elrond and Gandalf do not seem disposed to talk of this?'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Frodo found himself walking with Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf has been here often."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It is a pity that Gandalf did not find out more sooner."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I have thought several times of going back to Hobbiton for it; but I am getting old, and they would not let me: Gandalf and Elrond, I mean."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'And Gandalf said: \"The Ring has passed on, Bilbo."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Odd sort of remark, just like Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `You can trot off and tell Gandalf that he has gone to bed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" On a seat cut in the stone beside a turn in the path they came upon Gandalf and Bilbo deep in talk."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'You may have a chance later,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `That is the warning bell for the Council of Elrond,' cried Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf led them to the porch where Frodo had found his friends the evening before."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `Here,' said Elrond, turning to Gandalf, `is Boromir, a man from the South."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" said Gandalf solemnly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I still want to know a good deal, especially about Gandalf.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But these things it is the part of Gandalf to make clear; and I call upon him last, for it is the place of honour, and in all this matter he has been the chief.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `Some, Galdor,' said Gandalf, `would think the tidings of Glóin, and the pursuit of Frodo, proof enough that the halfling's trove is a thing of great worth to the Enemy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf fell silent, gazing eastward from the porch to the far peaks of the Misty Mountains, at whose great roots the peril of the world had so long lain hidden."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `From the first my heart misgave me, against all reason that I knew,' said Gandalf, `and I desired to know how this thing came to Gollum, and how long he had possessed it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And since it seemed fit that Isildur's heir should labour to repair Isildur's fault, I went with Gandalf on the long and hopeless search.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then Gandalf told how they had explored the whole length of Wilderland, down even to the Mountains of Shadow and the fences of Mordor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `But in that time also he made this scroll,' said Gandalf; `and that is not remembered in Gondor, it would seem."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For my part I hope never to look upon him again; but Gandalf came and endured long speech with him.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `Yes, long and weary,' said Gandalf, `but not without profit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `Never before has any voice dared to utter the words of that tongue in Imladris, Gandalf the Grey,' said Elrond, as the shadow passed and the company breathed once more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `And let us hope that none will ever speak it here again,' answered Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We guarded this creature day and night, at Gandalf's bidding, much though we wearied of the task."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Gandalf bade us hope still for his cure, and we had not the heart to keep him ever in dungeons under the earth, where he would fall back into his old black thoughts.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `Well, well, he is gone,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ` \"Gandalf! \""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Tell them to bring news of anything that bears on this matter to Saruman and Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ` \"So you have come, Gandalf,\" he said to me gravely; but in his eyes there seemed to be a white light, as if a cold laughter was in his heart."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Have you indeed, Gandalf the _Grey_! "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It has seldom been heard of that Gandalf the Grey sought for aid, one so cunning and so wise, wandering about the lands, and concerning himself in every business, whether it belongs to him or not.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And here you will stay, Gandalf the Grey, and rest from journeys."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And listen, Gandalf, my old friend and helper! "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It would be wise, Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And why not, Gandalf? "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Or until it is found in your despite, and the Ruler has time to turn to lighter matters: to devise, say, a fitting reward for the hindrance and insolence of Gandalf the Grey.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf paused astonished and looked at him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `Then it was late in coming,' said Gandalf, 'as you will see."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf the Grey caught like a fly in a spider's treacherous web!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf laughed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But such a thing has not happened before, that Gandalf broke tryst and did not come when he promised."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `He would not have come,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `No, I should not put it so,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `No,' said Gandalf, `not willingly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `But Gandalf has revealed to us that we cannot destroy it by any craft that we here possess,' said Elrond."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `Not safe for ever,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `Nor I,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `Balin will find no ring in Moria,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `Of course, my dear Bilbo,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" said Gandalf, looking in through the window, which was near the ground."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even old Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `You were wrong,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Have they started yet, Gandalf?'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'I am afraid it will,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'You cannot destroy Ringwraiths like that,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So great was Frodo's delight at this announcement that Gandalf left the window-sill, where he had been sitting, and took off his hat and bowed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" said Frodo to Bilbo when Gandalf had gone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Eight out of the Nine are accounted for at least,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With you and your faithful servant, Gandalf will go; for this shall be his great task, and maybe the end of his labours."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `Neither does Frodo,' said Gandalf, unexpectedly supporting Pippin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aragorn and Gandalf walked together or sat speaking of their road and the perils they would meet; and they pondered the storied and figured maps and books of lore that were in the house of Elrond."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf bore his staff, but girt at his side was the elven-sword Glamdring, the mate of Orcrist that lay now upon the breast of Thorin under the Lonely Mountain."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Their farewells had been said in the great hall by the fire, and they were only waiting now for Gandalf, who had not yet come out of the house."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At that moment Elrond came out with Gandalf, and he called the Company to him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf walked in front, and with him went Aragorn, who knew this land even in the dark."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf stood at Frodo's side and looked out under his hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `It is for the Dimrill Dale that we are making,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `May you have joy of the sight, my good dwarf l' said Gandalf."}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Then we must be more careful,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tThen he sprang up and went and wakened Gandalf.\r\n\t`And in that case so is the Redhorn Gate,' said Gandalf; `and how we can get over that without being seen, I cannot imagine.\r\n\t`Well, you can go on looking forward,' said Gandalf.\r\n\the whispered to Gandalf, who was just ahead.\r\n\tGandalf snuffed the air and looked back.\r\n\tFrodo overheard these words, and understood that Gandalf and Aragorn were continuing some debate that had begun long before.\r\n\t'I think no good of our course from beginning to end, as you know well, Gandalf,' answered Aragorn.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf.\r\n\t'We must decide before we go further,' answered Gandalf.\r\n\tIn the late afternoon, while the others were finishing their breakfast, Gandalf and Aragorn went aside together and stood looking at Caradhras.\r\n\tWhen they returned to the Company Gandalf spoke, and then he knew that it had been decided to face the weather and the high pass.\r\n\t`From signs that we have seen lately,' said Gandalf, 'I fear that the Redhorn Gate may be watched; and also I have doubts of the weather that is coming up behind.\r\n\t'Very well,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tThe dark bent shapes of Gandalf and Aragorn only a pace or two ahead could hardly be seen.\r\n\tGandalf halted.\r\n\t'His arm has grown long,' said Gandalf.\r\n\t`It matters little who is the enemy, if we cannot beat off his attack; said Gandalf.\r\n\t`Either stop where we are, or go back,' said Gandalf.\r\n\t`This will be the death of the halflings, Gandalf,' said Boromir.\r\n\t`Give them this,' said Gandalf, searching in his pack and drawing out a leathern flask.\r\n\t'The choice seems near now between fire and death, Gandalf.\r\n\t'You may make a fire, if you can,' answered Gandalf.\r\n\tAt last reluctantly Gandalf himself took a hand.\r\n\t'I have written _Gandalf is here_ in signs that all can read from Rivendell to the mouths of Anduin.'\r\n\t`If Gandalf would go before us with a bright flame, he might melt a path for you,' said Legolas.\r\n\t`If Elves could fly over mountains, they might fetch the Sun to save us,' answered Gandalf.\r\n\the said to Gandalf.\r\n\tBehind in the narrow but now well-trodden track came Gandalf, leading Bill with Gimli perched among the baggage.\r\n\t'That cannot be helped now,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tGandalf spared them one more mouthful each of the miruvor of Rivendell.\r\n\t'We still have our journey and our errand before us,' answered Gandalf.\r\n\t`You are right, Frodo,' said Gandalf: `to go back is to admit defeat and face worse defeat to come.\r\n\t`There is a way that we may attempt,' said Gandalf.\r\n\t'The road that I speak of leads to the Mines of Moria,' said Gandalf.\r\n\t'Things have changed since you came north, Boromir,' answered Gandalf.\r\n\t`You speak of what you do not know, when you liken Moria to the stronghold of Sauron,' answered Gandalf.\r\n\t'I will tread the path with you, Gandalf! '\r\n\tsaid Gandalf.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf.\r\n\tIt is not of the Ring, nor of us others that I am thinking now, but of you, Gandalf.\r\n\t`I do not wish to go,' he said; `but neither do I wish to refuse the advice of Gandalf.\r\n\tGandalf will get votes easier in the light of the morning than in this cold gloom.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf.\r\n\t`There was a door south-west of Caradhras, some fifteen miles as the crow flies, and maybe twenty as the wolf runs,' answered Gandalf grimly.\r\n\tWhatever may be in store for old Gandalf, I'll wager it isn't a wolf's belly.'\r\n\tGandalf stood up and strode forward, holding his staff aloft.\r\n\t`Gandalf is here.\r\n\tGandalf and Aragorn strode forward, but the hill was deserted; the hunting packs had fled.\r\n\tcried Gandalf to the hobbits.\r\n\tIn the wavering firelight Gandalf seemed suddenly to grow: he rose up, a great menacing shape like the monument of some ancient king of stone set upon a hill.\r\n\t`It is as I feared,' said Gandalf.\r\n\t`We must reach the doors before sunset,' said Gandalf, 'or I fear we shall not reach them at all.\r\n\t`I do not know which to hope,' said Boromir grimly: `that Gandalf will find what he seeks, or that coming to the cliff we shall find the gates lost for ever.\r\n\tBut either Gandalf was astray, or else the land had changed in recent years; for he did not strike the stream where he looked to find it, only a few miles southwards from their start.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf.\r\n\tThey found the stone steps without difficulty, and Gimli sprang swiftly up them, followed by Gandalf and Frodo.\r\n\t`There are the Walls of Moria,' said Gandalf, pointing across the water.\r\n\t`But in any case we cannot take the poor beast into the Mines,' said Gandalf.\r\n\t`I am sorry,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tThey hurried forward, for they had still a mile or two to go before they could reach the point on the far shore that Gandalf was making for; and then he had still to find the doors.\r\n\tGandalf now pressed on at a great pace, and the others followed as quickly as they could.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf.\r\n\t'I have heard both,' said Gandalf; 'and I will not give judgement now.\r\n\t'But you can't leave poor old Bill behind in this forsaken place, Mr. Gandalf! '\r\n\t'It will be short of murder, I hope,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tWhen this was done they turned to watch Gandalf.\r\n\t'But this Door was not made to be a secret known only to Dwarves,' said Gandalf, coming suddenly to life and turning round.\r\n\tAt the top, as high as Gandalf could reach, was an arch of interlacing letters in an Elvish character.\r\n\t`And the Star of the House of Fëanor,' said Gandalf.\r\n\t`The words are in the elven-tongue of the West of Middle-earth in the Elder Days,' answered Gandalf.\r\n\t'Yes,' said Gandalf, 'these doors are probably governed by words.\r\n\t'But do not _you_ know the word, Gandalf? '\r\n\tThe others looked dismayed; only Aragorn, who knew Gandalf well, remained silent and unmoved.\r\n\t`Knock on the doors with your head, Peregrin Took,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tAgain Gandalf approached the wall, and lifting up his arms he spoke in tones of command and rising wrath.\r\n\t'Why doesn't Gandalf do something quick? '\r\n\tGandalf took no notice of them.\r\n\t`I was wrong after all,' said Gandalf, 'and Gimli too.\r\n\tshouted Gandalf leaping back.\r\n\tSam and Frodo were only a few steps up, and Gandalf had just begun to climb, when the groping tentacles writhed across the narrow shore and fingered the cliff-wall and the doors.\r\n\tGandalf turned and paused.\r\n\tThey heard Gandalf go back down the steps and thrust his staff against the doors.\r\n\t'I do not know,' answered Gandalf, 'but the arms were all guided by one purpose.\r\n\t'I will,' said Gandalf, 'and Gimli shall walk with me.\r\n\tAfter they had eaten, Gandalf gave them each a third sip of the miruvor of Rivendell.\r\n\t'I cannot say,' answered Gandalf.\r\n\tGandalf walked in front as before.\r\n\tGimli aided Gandalf very little, except by his stout courage.\r\n\tOften the wizard consulted him at points where the choice of way was doubtful; but it was always Gandalf who had the final word.\r\n\tTo Gandalf the far-off memories of a journey long before were now of little help, but even in the gloom and despite all windings of the road he knew whither he wished to go, and he did not falter, as long as there was a path that led towards his goal.\r\n\tThere was a pause longer than usual, and Gandalf and Gimli were whispering together; the others were crowded behind, waiting anxiously.\r\n\tOne sign of change that he soon had noticed was that he could see more in the dark than any of his companions, save perhaps Gandalf.\r\n\tThey had been going for several hours with only brief halts, when Gandalf came to his first serious check.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf, standing uncertainly under the arch.\r\n\tcried Gandalf as Merry and Pippin pushed forward, glad to find a place where they could rest with at least more feeling of shelter than in the open passage.\r\n\tcried Gandalf.\r\n\t`Yes,' said Gandalf, 'and I do not like it.\r\n\tHe wished he could cover the hole, if only with a blanket, but he dared not move or go near it, even though Gandalf seemed to be asleep.\r\n\tActually Gandalf was awake, though lying still and silent.\r\n\tIt was Gandalf who roused them all from sleep.\r\n\tGandalf seemed pleased.\r\n\t`That is all that I shall venture on for the present,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf.\r\n\t'For _mithril_,' answered Gandalf.\r\n\t'Yes,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf: `For morning it is again at last.\r\n\tAfter they had breakfasted Gandalf decided to go on again at once.\r\n\t'Maybe,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tGandalf came quickly to his side.\r\n\tOn the slab runes were deeply graven:  'These are Daeron's Runes, such as were used of old in Moria,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tGandalf lifted it carefully, but the leaves crackled and broke as he laid it on the slab.\r\n\tAt last Gandalf looked up.\r\n\t`Well, I can read no more for a long way,' said Gandalf, 'except the word _gold_, and _Durin's Axe_ and something _helm_.\r\n\tGandalf paused and set a few leaves aside.\r\n\t`I fear he had ill tidings to record in a fair hand,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tGandalf paused and stood in silent thought.\r\n\tGandalf raised his head and looked round.\r\n\t'Back to the hall,' answered Gandalf.\r\n\tGandalf had hardly spoken these words, when there came a great noise: a rolling _Boom_ that seemed to come from depths far below, and to tremble in the stone at their feet.\r\n\tcried Gandalf.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf.\r\n\tWith a quick movement Gandalf stepped before the narrow opening of the door and thrust forward his staff: There was a dazzling flash that lit the chamber and the passage outside.\r\n\tcried Gandalf.\r\n\tshouted Gandalf.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf fiercely.\r\n\tFrodo thought he could hear the voice of Gandalf above, muttering words that ran down the sloping roof with a sighing echo.\r\n\tGandalf came flying down the steps and fell to the ground in the midst of the Company.\r\n\tGandalf took no turns, right or left, for the passage seemed to be going in the direction that he desired.\r\n\tGandalf felt the ground with his staff like a blind man.\r\n\tAt the bottom of the seventh flight Gandalf halted.\r\n\t'I do not know,' answered Gandalf.\r\n\t'You take after Bilbo,' said Gandalf.\r\n\t`_Ghâsh!_' muttered Gandalf.\r\n\tWhen they came to the arch Gandalf went through, signing to them to wait.\r\n\t'If we had come by the main road down from the upper halls, we should have been trapped here,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf.\r\n\tcalled Gandalf.\r\n\tAt the brink Gandalf halted and the others came up in a pack behind.\r\n\tAnother pierced Gandalf's hat and stuck there like a black feather.\r\n\t'A Balrog,' muttered Gandalf.\r\n\tcried Gandalf, recalling his strength.\r\n\tAragorn and Boromir did not heed the command, but still held their ground, side by side, behind Gandalf at the far end of the bridge.\r\n\tGandalf stood in the middle of the span, leaning on the staff in his left hand, but in his other hand Glamdring gleamed, cold and white.\r\n\tBut Gandalf stood firm.\r\n\tIt stepped forward slowly on to the bridge, and suddenly it drew itself up to a great height, and its wings were spread from wall to wall; but still Gandalf could be seen, glimmering in the gloom; he seemed small, and altogether alone: grey and bent, like a wizened tree before the onset of a storm.\r\n\t'I am with you, Gandalf! '\r\n\tAt that moment Gandalf lifted his staff, and crying aloud he smote the bridge before him.\r\n\t`Farewell, Gandalf! '\r\n\tFor I shall take you by the road that Gandalf chose, and first I hope to come to the woods where the Silverlode flows into the Great River-out yonder.'\r\n\tIs this the coat that Gandalf spoke of?\r\n\t`Gandalf the Grey set out with the Company, but he did not pass the borders of this land.\r\n\t`Gandalf the Grey fell into shadow.\r\n\t'Gandalf was our guide, and he led us through Moria; and when our escape seemed beyond hope he saved us, and he fell.'\r\n\tAnd if it were possible, one would say that at the last Gandalf fell from wisdom into folly, going needlessly into the net of Moria.'\r\n\t`Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life.\r\n\tYet not in vain will it prove, maybe, that you came to this land seeking aid, as Gandalf himself plainly purposed.\r\n\tAnd if my designs had not gone amiss, it would have been governed by Gandalf the Grey, and then mayhap things would have gone otherwise.\r\n\tNow as the companions sat or walked together they spoke of Gandalf, and all that each had known and seen of him came clear before their minds.\r\n\tNo fireworks like poor Gandalf used to show.\r\n\tAnd I don't miss Gandalf's fireworks, but his bushy eyebrows, and his quick temper, and his voice.'\r\n\tIt's when we leave this land that we shall miss Gandalf worse, I'm thinking.'\r\n\tSuddenly Frodo realized that it reminded him of Gandalf.\r\n\tDoubt came into Frodo's mind: was this a vision of Gandalf on one of his many lonely journeys long ago, or was it Saruman?\r\n\t`I would ask one thing before we go,' said Frodo, `a thing which I often meant to ask Gandalf in Rivendell.\r\n\tDid not Gandalf tell you that the rings give power according to the measure of each possessor?\r\n\t'Beyond Lothlórien I do not know what Gandalf intended to do.\r\n\tHis own plan, while Gandalf remained with them, had been to go with Boromir, and with his sword help to deliver Gondor.\r\n\tBut in Moria the burden of Gandalf had been laid on him; and he knew that he could not now forsake the Ring, if Frodo refused in the end to go with Boromir.\r\n\tThen the light of his eyes faded, and he spoke to himself: `Would that Gandalf were here!\r\n\tI am not Gandalf, and though I have tried to bear his part, I do not know what design or hope he had for this hour, if indeed he had any.\r\n\tAll that had happened since Bilbo left the Shire was passing through his mind, and he recalled and pondered everything that he could remember of Gandalf's words.\r\n\t'Gandalf, Elrond  all these folk have taught you to say so.\r\n\tNow indeed we miss Gandalf most.'\r\n\tVain was Gandalf's trust in me.\r\n\tIt is as Gandalf feared: by some means the traitor Saruman has had news of our journey.\r\n\tIt is likely too that he knows of Gandalf's fall.\r\n\t'But Gandalf spoke of a rumour that they pay tribute to Mordor ' said Gimli.\r\n\tGandalf the Grey was our leader.'\r\n\t'Gandalf!'\r\n\t'Gandalf Greyhame is known in the Mark: but his name, I warn you, is no longer a password to the king's favour.\r\n\tUntil then we counted Saruman our friend, hut Gandalf came then and warned us that sudden war was preparing in Isengard.\r\n\tSpeak not the name of Gandalf loudly in Théoden's ears!\r\n\tFor Gandalf took the horse that is called Shadowfax, the most precious of all the king's steeds, chief of the _Mearas_, which only the Lord of the Mark may ride.\r\n\t'Then Shadowfax has found his way alone from the far North,' said Aragorn; 'for it was there that he and Gandalf parted.\r\n\tGandalf will ride no longer.\r\n\tHe walks here and there, they say, as an old man hooded and cloaked, very like to Gandalf, as many now recall.\r\n\t'But Gandalf was not,' said Legolas.\r\n\t'But Gandalf chose to come himself, and he was the first to be lost ' answered Gimli.\r\n\t'The counsel of Gandalf was not founded on foreknowledge of safety, for himself or for others,' said Aragorn.\r\n\t'I wish Gandalf had never persuaded Elrond to let us come,' he thought.\r\n\tHe wished now that he had learned more in Rivendell, and looked more at maps and things; but in those days the plans for the journey seemed to be in more competent hands, and he had never reckoned with being cut off from Gandalf, or from Strider, and even from Frodo.\r\n\tAll that he could remember about Rohan was that Gandalf's horse, Shadowfax, had come from that land.\r\n\tWhat is Gandalf up to?\r\n\tAnd did you know Gandalf?'\r\n\tBut you speak of Master Gandalf, as if he was in a story that had come to an end.'\r\n\t'The story seems to be going on, but I am afraid Gandalf has fallen out of it.'\r\n\tTreebeard was however especially interested in everything that concerned Gandalf; and most interested of all in Saruman's doings.\r\n\tThe hobbits regretted very much that they knew so little about them: only a rather vague report by Sam of what Gandalf had told the Council.\r\n\tBut I do not doubt that you are doing as Gandalf would wish.\r\n\tBy root and twig, but it is a strange business: up sprout a little folk that are not in the old lists, and behold the Nine forgotten Riders reappear to hunt them, and Gandalf takes them on a great journey, and Galadriel harbours them in Caras Galadhon, and Orcs pursue them down all the leagues of Wilderland: indeed they seem to be caught up in a great storm.\r\n\t'Gandalf!'\r\n\tGandalf!'\r\n\t'Gandalf,' the old man repeated, as if recalling from old memory a long disused word.\r\n\tI was Gandalf.'\r\n\t'Yes, you may still call me Gandalf,' he said, and the voice was the voice of their old friend and guide.\r\n\t'Gandalf!'\r\n\t'Yes, I am white now,' said Gandalf.\r\n\t'No, I did not find them,' said Gandalf.\r\n\t'Yes,' said Gandalf, 'that was Gwaihir the Windlord, who rescued me from Orthanc.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf, and there was a gleam in his eye and a smile on his face.\r\n\tFor a long while Gandalf said nothing, and he asked no questions.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf, and paused for a while in thought.\r\n\t'Indeed yes,' said Gandalf.\r\n\t'The victor would emerge stronger than either, and free from doubt,' said Gandalf.\r\n\t'One that you cannot slay with arrows,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tWas it you, Gandalf, or Saruman that we saw last night?'\r\n\t'You certainly did not see me,' answered Gandalf, 'therefore I must guess that you saw Saruman.\r\n\tGandalf laughed again.\r\n\t'With Treebeard and the Ents,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tnow you are asking much,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tcried Gandalf.\r\n\t'I do not know,' said Gandalf.\r\n\t'No,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tI am Gandalf, Gandalf the White, but Black is mightier still.'\r\n\t'I did not say so,' said Gandalf.\r\n\t'We shall see, we shall see,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tHe rose and looked long at Gandalf.\r\n\t'Do I not say truly, Gandalf,' said Aragorn at last, 'that you could go whithersoever you wished quicker than I?\r\n\t'But first, it would ease my heart, Gandalf, to hear what befell you in Moria.\r\n\t'I have stayed already too long,' answered Gandalf.\r\n\t'Come, Gandalf, tell us how you fared with the Balrog!'\r\n\tsaid Gandalf, and for a moment it seemed that a cloud of pain passed over his face, and he sat silent, looking old as death.\r\n\t'Yet it has a bottom, beyond light and knowledge,' said Gandalf.\r\n\t'It was made, and it had not been destroyed,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tSuddenly Gandalf laughed.\r\n\tGandalf fell silent and shut his eyes.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf, opening his eyes. '\r\n\t'In happy hour you have returned to us, Gandalf,' cried the Dwarf, capering as he sang loudly in the strange dwarf-tongue.\r\n\t'Since Gandalf's head is now sacred, let us find one that it is right to cleave!'\r\n\t'That will not be far to seek,' said Gandalf, rising from his seat.\r\n\tTime presses,' said Gandalf.\r\n\t'Certainly,' said Gandalf.\r\n\t'Nor will you again,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tAs soon as Shadowfax saw Gandalf, he checked his pace and whinnied loudly; then trotting gently forward he stooped his proud head and nuzzled his great nostrils against the old man's neck.\r\n\tGandalf caressed him.\r\n\t'We go at once to Meduseld, the hall of your master, Théoden,' said Gandalf, addressing them gravely.\r\n\tDid you know that he was at hand, Gandalf?'\r\n\tGandalf spoke now to Shadowfax, and the horse set off at a good pace, yet not beyond the measure of the others.\r\n\t'He is steering a straight course now for the halls of Théoden under the slopes of the White Mountains,' said Gandalf.\r\n\t'There lies the Gap of Rohan,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf.\r\n\tGandalf only allowed them a few hours' rest.\r\n\tLegolas and Gimli slept and Aragorn lay flat, stretched upon his back; but Gandalf stood, leaning on his staff, gazing into the darkness, east and west.\r\n\tGimli nodded and would have fallen from his seat, if Gandalf had not clutched and shaken him.\r\n\tGandalf pointed ahead.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf.\r\n\t'Edoras those courts are called,' said Gandalf, 'and Meduseld is that golden hall.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf.\r\n\tWonder was in their eyes but little friendliness; and they looked darkly upon Gandalf.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf, looking sharply at the guard.\r\n\t'For I am Gandalf.\r\n\tSilent they stood now above and spoke no word, until Gandalf stepped out upon the paved terrace at the stairs head.\r\n\t'This is idle talk,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf.\r\n\t'Your staff,' he said to Gandalf.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf.\r\n\tHe looked hard at the ash-staff on which Gandalf leaned.\r\n\tAt length Gandalf spoke.\r\n\tBut truth to tell your welcome is doubtful here, Master Gandalf.\r\n\tWhy should I welcome you, Gandalf Stormcrow?\r\n\t'You are held wise, my friend Wormtongue, and are doubtless a great support to your master,' answered Gandalf in a soft voice.\r\n\t'The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late, Théoden son of Thengel,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tGimli strode a pace forward, but felt suddenly the hand of Gandalf clutch him by the shoulder, and he halted, standing stiff as stone.\r\n\tThus Gandalf softly sang, and then suddenly he changed.\r\n\tOnly Gandalf could be seen, standing white and tall before the blackened hearth.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf.\r\n\tThey came to the doors and Gandalf knocked.\r\n\t'Send your guards down to the stairs foot,' said Gandalf.\r\n\t'Now, lord,' said Gandalf, 'look out upon your land!\r\n\t'No,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tI would now that you had come before, Gandalf.\r\n\t'Much,' said Gandalf.\r\n\t'A man may love you and yet not love Wormtongue or his counsels' said Gandalf.\r\n\tThe guilty shall bring the guilty to judgement,' said Théoden, and his voice was grim, yet he looked at Gandalf and smiled and as he did so many lines of care were smoothed away and did not return.\r\n\tWhen Háma had been summoned and had gone, Gandalf led Théoden to a stone seat, and then sat himself before the king upon the topmost stair.\r\n\t'There is no time to tell all that you should hear,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tQuickly now Gandalf spoke.\r\n\tBut ever as he spoke the light shone brighter in Théoden's eye, and at the last he rose from his seat to his full height, and Gandalf beside him, and together they looked out from the high place towards the East.\r\n\t'Verily,' said Gandalf, now in a loud voice, keen and clear, 'that way lies our hope, where sits our greatest fear.\r\n\tSlowly Théoden sat down again, as if weariness still struggled to master him against the will of Gandalf.\r\n\t'Your fingers would remember their old strength better, if they grasped a sword-hilt,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf.\r\n\tNever again shall it be said, Gandalf, that you come only with grief!'\r\n\tNow, Gandalf, you said that you had counsel to give, if I would hear it.\r\n\t'You have yourself already taken it,' answered Gandalf.\r\n\tBut you my guests-truly you said, Gandalf, that the courtesy of my hall is lessened.\r\n\t'Hope, yes,' said Gandalf.\r\n\t'Nay, Gandalf!'\r\n\t'But your people must not be both unarmed and shepherdless' said Gandalf.\r\n\t'Nay, Éomer, you do not fully understand the mind of Master Wormtongue,' said Gandalf, turning his piercing glance upon him.\r\n\tHe stepped forward, but Gandalf stayed him with his hand.\r\n\t'That word comes too oft and easy from your lips,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tThe others were silent while Théoden questioned Gandalf concerning Saruman.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf.\r\n\t'Say also,' said Gandalf, 'that to crooked eyes truth may wear a wry face.'\r\n\t'Whether I came in time or not is yet to be seen,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tGandalf took no armour; and Gimli needed no coat of rings, even if one had been found to match his stature, for there was no hauberk in the hoards of Edoras of better make than his short corslet forged beneath the Mountain in the North.\r\n\tThe king now went down the stair with Gandalf beside him.\r\n\tI wish I could walk and not bump like a sack at Gandalf's saddlebow.'\r\n\t'Yet doubtless Gandalf will gladly put you down on your feet when blows begin; or Shadowfax himself.\r\n\tGandalf will be at the head with the Lord of the Mark; but Firefoot, my horse, will bear us both, if you will.'\r\n\tsaid Gandalf.\r\n\tGandalf whistled and called aloud the horse's name, and far away he tossed his head and neighed, and turning sped towards the host like an arrow.\r\n\tHere now I name my guest, Gandalf Greyhame, wisest of counsellors; most welcome of wanderers, a lord of the Mark, a chieftain of the Eorlingas while our kin shall last; and I give to him Shadowfax, prince of horses.'\r\n\t'I thank you, Théoden King,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tGandalf dropped back to where Legolas rode beside Éomer.\r\n\t'And behind us comes a very storm of Mordor,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tWhile Théoden was speaking, Gandalf rode a short way ahead, and he sat there alone, gazing north to Isengard and west to the setting sun.\r\n\t'That Gandalf Greyhame has need of haste,' answered Háma.\r\n\t'True enough,' said Háma; 'but for myself, I will wait until I see Gandalf again.'\r\n\t'Has aught been seen of Gandalf?'\r\n\t'It will go ill with Wormtongue, if Gandalf comes upon him said Théoden.\r\n\tBut in this need we have no better choice than to go on, as Gandalf said, to Helm's Gate, whether Erkenbrand be there or no.\r\n\tHad I known that the strength of Isengard was grown so great, maybe I should not so rashly have ridden forth to meet it, for all the arts of Gandalf.\r\n\t'Do not judge the counsel of Gandalf, until all is over, lord,' said Aragorn.\r\n\t'Gandalf is come again!'\r\n\t_Chapter 8_ The Road to Isengard  So it was that in the light of a fair morning King Théoden and Gandalf the White Rider met again upon the green grass beside the Deeping-stream.\r\n\tHe turned and gazed in wonder, first at the wood and then at Gandalf.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf.\r\n\tYou are mighty in wizardry, Gandalf the White!'\r\n\tThen they all gazed at Gandalf with still greater wonder.\r\n\tGandalf laughed long and merrily.\r\n\t'It is not wizardry, but a power far older,' said Gandalf: 'a power that walked the earth, ere elf sang or hammer rang.\r\n\t'If you would learn that, you should come with me to Isengard ' answered Gandalf.\r\n\t'Yes,' said Gandalf.\r\n\t'Nevertheless to Isengard I go,' said Gandalf.\r\n\t'I wish to speak with Saruman, as soon as may be now,' said Gandalf, 'and since he has done you great injury, it would be fitting if you were there.\r\n\tIt is an ill that no leech can wholly cure, not even Gandalf.'\r\n\t'Then let all who are to ride with me rest now,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tWith Gandalf would go Aragorn, and Legolas, and Gimli.\r\n\tThey had little wood for firing, and none would have dared to take an axe to the strange trees, even if Gandalf had not warned them to hurt neither bark nor bough at their great peril.\r\n\t'Let the Orcs lie,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tThe sun was already drawing near the hills upon the west of the Coomb, when at last Théoden and Gandalf and their companions rode down from the Dike.\r\n\tBut Gandalf went forward, leading the company, and where the road from the Hornburg met the trees they saw now an opening like an arched gate under mighty boughs; and through it Gandalf passed, and they followed him.\r\n\tLegolas and Gimli were now riding together upon one horse; and they kept close beside Gandalf, for Gimli was afraid of the wood.\r\n\t'It is hot in here,' said Legolas to Gandalf.\r\n\t'Yes,' said Gandalf.\r\n\t'That, I think, no one will ever know,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tHow far is it to Isengard, Gandalf?'\r\n\tsaid Gandalf: 'five from the mouth of Deeping-coomb to the Fords: and ten more from there to the gates of Isengard.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf.\r\n\t'You need no weapons,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tWhat are they, Gandalf?\r\n\t'They are the shepherds of the trees,' answered Gandalf.\r\n\t'You should be glad, Théoden King,' said Gandalf.\r\n\t'It may,' said Gandalf.\r\n\t'So it would seem,' said Gandalf.\r\n\t'This is our way,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tFear fell on them seeing Gandalf in the moon, and Shadowfax his horse shining like silver.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf.\r\n\t'Here lie all the Men of the Mark that fell near this place,' said Gandalf.\r\n\t'Is this your work also, Gandalf, my friend?'\r\n\t'With the help of Shadowfax  and others,' said Gandalf.\r\n\t'What do you think of that, Gandalf?'\r\n\t'Maybe he is,' said Gandalf.\r\n\tsaid Gandalf.\r\n\tNow Gandalf rode to the great pillar of the Hand, and passed it: and as he did so the Riders saw to their wonder that the Hand appeared no longer white.\r\n\tUnheeding Gandalf rode on into the mist, and reluctantly they followed him.\r\n\tAt last Gandalf halted and beckoned to them; and they came, and saw that beyond him the mists had cleared, and a pale sunlight shone.\r\n\tA young man he looked, or like one, though not much more than half a man in height; his head of brown curling hair was uncovered, but he was clad in a travel-stained cloak of the same hue and shape as the companions of Gandalf had worn when they rode to Edoras.\r\n\tlaughed Gandalf.\r\n\t'So these are the lost ones of your company, Gandalf?\r\n\tHow old Toby came by the plant...' 'You do not know your danger, Théoden,' interrupted Gandalf.\r\n\tasked Gandalf.\r\n\t'It is past noon,' said Gandalf, 'and we at any rate have not eaten since early morning.\r\n\tI was to say that, if the Lord of the Mark and Gandalf will ride to the northern wall they will find Treebeard there, and he will welcome them.\r\n\tGandalf laughed.\r\n\t_Chapter 9_ Flotsam and Jetsam  Gandalf and the King's company rode away, turning eastward to make the circuit of the ruined walls of Isengard.\r\n\t'We will sit on the edge of ruin and talk, as Gandalf says, while he is busy elsewhere.\r\n\t'We caught a glimpse of the old villain, or so Gandalf hints,' said Gimli.\r\n\tVery different from old Gandalf.\r\n\tGandalf, Elrond, and Galadriel, perhaps, now that his wickedness has been laid bare, but very few others.'\r\n\t'Gandalf!'\r\n\tGandalf obviously expected to find Treebeard here; and Treebeard might almost have been loitering about near the gates on purpose to meet him.\r\n\tI can only suppose that he had seen Gandalf or had some news of him, but would not say anything in a hurry.\r\n\tDon't be hasty\" is his motto; but nobody, not even Elves, will say much about Gandalf's movements when he is not there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf!\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" '\"Treebeard,\" said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It must have seemed very hasty to Treebeard, for Gandalf was in a tremendous hurry, and was already talking at a great pace, before they passed out of hearing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then Gandalf came back to us, and he seemed relieved, almost merry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" '\"But Gandalf,\" I cried, \"where have you been?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" '\"Wherever I have been, I am back,\" he answered in the genuine Gandalf manner."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Treebeard was very thoughtful after Gandalf had gone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And safer too, somehow, since Gandalf came back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We rushed out before the gates, and I stood and stared, half expecting to see Strider and Gandalf come riding up at the head of an army."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf got here first.\r\n\tPut all the rats in one trap, said Gandalf; and I will.\r\n\tBut you have only two choices: to stay with me until Gandalf and your master arrive; or to cross the water."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But I hope that the Ents may have found time to brew some of their draughts from the mountain-springs, and we shall see Gandalf's beard curling when he returns."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Yet I think I shall mention it to Gandalf, small matter though it may seem among his great affairs.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'There is Gandalf, and Théoden and his men!'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf rode forward to meet them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'The last is most likely, if you ride to his door with a light heart,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At the foot of the stairs Gandalf and the king dismounted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'I will go up,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'As you will,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" said Gandalf, and with that he climbed the steps, and Théoden went beside him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf stood before the door of Orthanc and beat on it with his staff."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf I know too well to have much hope that he seeks help or counsel here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He looked up at the face of Saruman with its dark solemn eyes bent down upon him, and then to Gandalf at his side; and he seemed to hesitate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf made no sign; but stood silent as stone, as one waiting patiently for some call that has not yet come."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It seemed to them that Gandalf had never spoken so fair and fittingly to their lord."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And over their hearts crept a shadow, the fear of a great danger: the end of the Mark in a darkness to which Gandalf was driving them, while Saruman stood beside a door of escape, holding it half open so that a ray of light came through."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'But you, Gandalf!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For you are proud, Gandalf-and not without reason, having a noble mind and eyes that look both deep and far."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf stirred, and looked up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf would ascend into the tower, to discuss deep things beyond their comprehension in the high chambers of Orthanc."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then Gandalf laughed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" said Gandalf still laughing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I am no fool, and I do not trust you, Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'The treacherous are ever distrustful,' answered Gandalf wearily."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Very much in the manner of Gandalf the Grey: so condescending, and so very kind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" answered Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" said Gandalf in a commanding voice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'I did not give you leave to go,' said Gandalf sternly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Behold, I am not Gandalf the Grey, whom you betrayed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I am Gandalf the White, who has returned from death."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There was a crack, and the staff split asunder in Saruman's hand, and the head of it fell down at Gandalf's feet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It glanced off the iron rail, even as Saruman left it, and passing close to Gandalf's head, it smote the stair on which he stood."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Gandalf was unmoved."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'That may be so,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'It is the end,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The riders hailed the king with joy, and saluted Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Well, that is done,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Not likely,' answered Gandalf, 'though they came to the balance of a hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'It seems that Saruman thinks so too,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Here are three of my companions, Treebeard,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Day is drawing to an end, yet Gandalf says you must go ere nightfall, and the Lord of the Mark is eager for his own house.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Yes, we must go, and go now,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then he turned to Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" _Chapter 11_ The Palantír  The sun was sinking behind the long western arm of the mountains when Gandalf and his companions, and the king with his Riders, set out again from Isengard."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf took Merry behind him, and Aragorn took Pippin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Are we riding far tonight, Gandalf?'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'But it is a greater honour to dangle at your tail, Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'You were riding with Gandalf.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Remember Saruman was once Gandalf's superior: head of the Council, whatever that may be exactly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf is the White now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Well, if Gandalf has changed at all, then he's closer than ever that's all,' Pippin argued."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I know I can't have it, with old Gandalf sitting on it, like a hen on an egg."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Driven by some impulse that he did not understand, Pippin walked softly to where Gandalf lay."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Gandalf made no sign; and drawn forward once more, half against his will, the hobbit crept up again from behind the wizard's head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At that moment Gandalf moved in his sleep, and muttered some words: they seemed to be in a strange tongue; his hand groped out and clasped the wrapped stone, then he sighed and did not move again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" he cried in a shrill and toneless voice shrinking away from Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then he struggled to get up and escape but Gandalf held him gently and firmly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Gandalf!'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Gandalf!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'That won't do,' said Gandalf sternly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Gandalf's face was still hard."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With that Gandalf returned to the others, who were still standing by the Orthanc-stone in troubled thought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'I think all will be well now,' answered Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf looked at Aragorn, and then, to the surprise of the others, he lifted the covered Stone, and bowed as he presented it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Do not then stumble at the end of the road,' answered Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'That many times is seen,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Not yet,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf was gazing up, his arms out and downwards, stiff, his hands clenched."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Going to Pippin, Gandalf picked him up in his arms."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aragorn lifted Pippin and set him in Gandalf's arms, ,wrapped in cloak and blanket."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He did not want to sleep, and he wanted to ride with Gandalf  and there he goes!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He was with Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'I did not know you rode bare-back, Gandalf,' he said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'I do not ride elf-fashion, except on Shadowfax,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'He is running now as fast as the swiftest horse could gallop,' answered Gandalf; 'but that is not fast for him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He heard Gandalf singing softly to himself, murmuring brief snatches of rhyme in many tongues, as the miles ran under them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'What are you saying, Gandalf?'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'About the _palantíri_ of the Kings of Old,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'To see far off, and to converse in thought with one another,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Oh yes, you had,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'It was a Black Rider on wings, a Nazgûl,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'I mean, it didn't know that I had... ' 'Of course not,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Leagues upon leagues,' answered Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As he fell slowly into sleep, Pippin had a strange feeling: he and Gandalf were still as stone, seated upon the statue of a running horse, while the world rolled away beneath his feet with a great noise of wind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of course, he also firmly held the incompatible belief that Mr. Frodo was the wisest person in the world (with the possible exception of Old Mr. Bilbo and of Gandalf)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aragorn could perhaps have told them that name and its significance: Gandalf would have warned them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But they were alone, and Aragorn was far away, and Gandalf stood amid the ruin of Isengard and strove with Saruman, delayed by treason."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Maybe Frodo felt it, not knowing it, as he had upon Amon Hen, even though he believed that Gandalf was gone, gone for ever into the shadow in Moria far away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He sat upon the ground for a long while, silent, his head bowed, striving to recall all that Gandalf had said to him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Indeed Gandalf's guidance had been taken from them too soon, too soon, while the Dark Land was still very far away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How they should enter it at the last Gandalf had not said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `I wish we had a thousand oliphaunts with Gandalf on a white one at their head,' he said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" _Mithrandir among the Elves, Tharkûn to the Dwarves; Olórin I was in my youth in the West that is forgotten, in the South Incánus, in the North Gandalf; to the East I go not._' 'Gandalf!'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf the Grey dearest of counsellors."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" with the wolves of the wild, in the snows under Caradhras, and in the mines of Moria where Gandalf fell."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He alone knew the way after Gandalf's fall."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf said so."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But I can say this: you have an air too, sir, that reminds me of, of  well, Gandalf, of wizards."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And Gandalf, your Mithrandir, he would have bidden you not to slay him for that reason, and for others."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Frodo knew, too, somehow, quite clearly that Gandalf would not have wished it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Twice Sam thought he heard him speaking Gandalf's name."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He even smiled grimly, feeling now as clearly as a moment before he had felt the opposite, that what he had to do, he had to do, if he could, and that whether Faramir or Aragorn or Elrond or Galadriel or Gandalf or anyone else ever knew about it was beside the purpose."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" `I wish old Gandalf was hare or somebody."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" THE RETURN OF THE KING  _being the third part of The Lord of the Rings_  _Chapter 1_ Minas Tirith  Pippin looked out from the shelter of Gandalf's cloak."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Gandalf had spoken soft words to him, and he had slept in a corner, tired but uneasy, dimly aware of comings and goings and of men talking and Gandalf giving orders."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A light kindled in the sky, a blaze of yellow fire behind dark barriers Pippin cowered back, afraid for a moment, wondering into what dreadful country Gandalf was bearing him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Where are we, Gandalf?'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" cried Pippin suddenly, clutching at Gandalf's cloak."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For answer Gandalf cried aloud to his horse."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Pippin became drowsy again and paid little attention to Gandalf telling him of the customs of Gondor, and how the Lord of the City had beacons built on the tops of outlying hills along both borders of the great range, and maintained posts at these points where fresh horses were always in readiness to bear his errand-riders to Rohan in the North, or to Belfalas in the South."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf was speaking to the men that barred his way, and as he listened Pippin became aware that he himself was being discussed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'I will vouch for him before the seat of Denethor,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Do not let Gandalf deceive you!'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'A Halfling,' answered Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Because I come seldom but when my help is needed,' answered Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But for Gandalf Stormcrow you would have seen a host of foes coming out of Anórien and no Riders of Rohan."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf passed now into the wide land beyond the Rammas Echor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Now after Gandalf had ridden for some time the light of day grew in the sky, and Pippin roused himself and looked up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And there where the White Mountains of Ered Nimrais came to their end he saw, as Gandalf had promised, the dark mass of Mount Mindolluin, the deep purple shadows of its high glens, and its tall face whitening in the rising day."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So Gandalf and Peregrin rode to the Great Gate of the Men of Gondor at the rising of the sun, and its iron doors rolled back before them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'It is upon you,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf dismounted, for no horse was allowed in the Citadel, and Shadowfax suffered himself to be led away at the soft word of his master."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Quickly Gandalf strode across the white-paved court."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Pippin glanced at it as he hurried after Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" _Seven stars and seven stones and one white tree._ The words that Gandalf had murmured came back into his mind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They walked down a paved passage, long and empty, and as they went Gandalf spoke softly to Pippin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Maybe, maybe,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf halted before a tall door of polished metal."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Yes,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then Gandalf spoke."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'It is,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'He would have gone,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Take the hilt,' said Gandalf, 'and speak after the Lord, if you are resolved on this.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Pippin saw then that they had been standing in alcoves on either side of the door, unseen as he and Gandalf entered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'It is all that I have to spare, for there is much else to heed,' he said to Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'And earlier, it is to be hoped,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He turned his dark eyes on Gandalf, and now Pippin saw a likeness between the two, and he felt the strain between them, almost as if he saw a line of smouldering fire, drawn from eye to eye, that might suddenly burst into flame."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Denethor looked indeed much more like a great wizard than Gandalf did, more kingly, beautiful, and powerful; and older."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet by a sense other than sight Pippin perceived that Gandalf had the greater power and the deeper wisdom, and a majesty that was veiled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Treebeard had said something about wizards, but even then he had not thought of Gandalf as one of them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What was Gandalf?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And then his musings broke off, and he saw that Denethor and Gandalf still looked each other in the eye, as if reading the other's mind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Pippin never forgot that hour in the great hall under the piercing eye of the Lord of Gondor, stabbed ever and anon by his shrewd questions, and all the while conscious of Gandalf at his side, watching and listening, and (so Pippin felt) holding in check a rising wrath and impatience."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf did not look at Pippin or speak a word to him as they went."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Are you angry with me, Gandalf?'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" said Gandalf, laughing suddenly; and he came and stood beside Pippin, putting his arm about the hobbit's shoulders and gazing out of the window."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf went to the door, and there he turned."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With that Gandalf went out; and as he did so, there came the note of a clear sweet bell ringing in a tower of the citadel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Gandalf, Mithrandir as you call him, asked me to see to his horse  Shadowfax, a great steed of Rohan, and the apple of the king's eye, I am told, though he has given him to Mithrandir for his services."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Gandalf will come as soon as he may."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For I saw the beacons last night and the errand-riders; and Gandalf said that it was a sign that war had begun."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf fell and has returned and is with us."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No stroke would have been struck in Rohan, I think, but for Gandalf.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'A pawn did Gandalf say?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Take me back to our room, and if Gandalf is not there, I will go where you like  as your guest.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf was not in the lodging and had sent no message; so Pippin went with Beregond and was made known to the men of the Third Company."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Indeed his only trouble was to be 'wary' according to the counsel of Gandalf, and not to let his tongue wag freely after the manner of a hobbit among friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After the meal Pippin stayed a while, and then took his leave, for a strange gloom was on him, and now he desired very much to see Gandalf again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf was not there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For a while he lay and listened for sounds of Gandalf's return, and then he fell into an uneasy sleep."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the night he was wakened by a light, and he saw that Gandalf had come and was pacing to and fro in the room beyond the curtain of the alcove."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'But the night will be too short,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" _Chapter 2_ The Passing of the Grey Company  Gandalf was gone, and the thudding hoofs of Shadowfax were lost in the night, when Merry came back to Aragorn."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf sent it, I would guess.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Did she not speak through Gandalf of the ride of the Grey Company from the North?'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even Gandalf feared that encounter.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There he found the remaining strength of his people already assembled; for as soon as his coming was known captains rode to meet him at the ford, bearing messages from Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Shadowfax came like a wind out of the West to Edoras, and Gandalf brought tidings of your victory to gladden our hearts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'We saw it also, but that was in the dead of night before Gandalf left us.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then it was that Gandalf counselled us not to assemble in the fields, but to meet you here in the valley under the mountains."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf spoke with great authority."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They have all gone to some doom: Gandalf and Pippin to war in the East; and Sam and Frodo to Mordor; and Strider and Legolas and Gimli to the Paths of the Dead."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf the Grey has been among us, and even now we are mustering for battle in the East.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" _Chapter 4_ The Siege of Gondor  Pippin was roused by Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Past the second hour,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'You know quite well,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Before long he was walking with Gandalf once more down the cold corridor to the door of the Tower Hall."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He beckoned Gandalf to a seat, but Pippin was left for a while standing unheeded."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Denethor turned to Gandalf, asking questions about the Rohirrim and their policies, and the position of Éomer, the king's nephew."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I have kicked my heels at the door of my master's chamber for many slow hours, while he has debated with Gandalf and the Prince and other great persons."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Yes,' said Pippin, 'Gandalf, too, is anxious."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf save us!'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf, Gandalf!'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They dismounted, and as grooms took Shadowfax and the other horse, they walked forward to the sentinel at the gate: Gandalf steadily, his grey cloak flung back, and a fire still smouldering in his eyes; the other, clad all in green, slowly, swaying a little as a weary or a wounded man."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But with that Gandalf stepped to his side and spoke."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Removed a little upon the other side sat Gandalf in a chair of carven wood; and he seemed at first to be asleep."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At that Gandalf sat up and gripped the arms of his chair; but he said nothing, and with a look stopped the exclamation on Pippin's lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Slowly, while the others sat silent and still, Faramir told his tale, with his eyes for the most part on Gandalf, though now and again his glance strayed to Pippin, as if to refresh his memory of others that he had seen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As his story was unfolded of his meeting with Frodo and his servant and of the events at Henneth Annûn, Pippin became aware that Gandalf's hands were trembling as they clutched the carven wood."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" White they seemed now and very old, and as he looked at them, suddenly with a thrill of fear Pippin knew that Gandalf, Gandalf himself, was troubled, even afraid."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then Gandalf sprang up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf paced the floor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'You think, as is your wont, my lord, of Gondor only,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Nonetheless I do not trust you,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For a moment the eyes of Denethor glowed again as he faced Gandalf, and Pippin felt once more the strain between their wills; but now almost it seemed as if their glances were like blades from eye to eye, flickering as they fenced."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Outside there was a starless blackness as Gandalf with Pippin beside him bearing a small torch, made his way to their lodging."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then at last Pippin took Gandalf's hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf put his hand on Pippin's head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf stood for a moment in thought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'I cannot answer that now,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf it was that last spoke to Faramir ere he rode east."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Yes, he will come,' said Gandalf, 'even if he comes too late."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Then I am needed there more than here,' said Gandalf, and rode off at once, and the glimmer of him faded soon from sight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was Gandalf that brought the first tidings."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Yet now under the Lord of Barad-dûr the most fell of all his captains is already master of your outer walls,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Pippin trembled, fearing that Gandalf would be stung to sudden wrath, but his fear was needless."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'It might be so,' Gandalf answered softly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'We are likely to see other newcomers first,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They were the remnant of the guard that was kept at that point where the way from Anórien and Rohan ran into the townlands: Ingold led them, the same who had admitted Gandalf and Pippin less than five days before, while the sun still rose and there was hope in the morning."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Have you asked Gandalf?'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So it was that Gandalf took command of the last defence of the City of Gondor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'I will take your leave, sir,' he said; 'for I want to see Gandalf very much indeed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'I must find Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh, where can I find Gandalf?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Do nothing until Gandalf comes!'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'I must find Gandalf at once.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He had found Gandalf; but he shrank back, cowering into a shadow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There waiting, silent and still in the space before the Gate, sat Gandalf upon Shadowfax: Shadowfax who alone among the free horses of the earth endured the terror, unmoving, steadfast as a graven image in Rath Dínen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'You cannot enter here,' said Gandalf, and the huge shadow halted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf did not move."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For a moment the thought flitted through Merry's mind: 'Where is Gandalf?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" _Chapter 7_ The Pyre of Denethor  When the dark shadow at the Gate withdrew Gandalf still sat motionless."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At that moment Gandalf stirred and spoke to Shadowfax, and was about to ride through the Gate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Gandalf, Gandalf! '"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf looked through the gaping Gate, and already on the fields he heard the gathering sound of battle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So Pippin poured out his tale, reaching up and touching Gandalf's knee with trembling hands."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Maybe I can,' said Gandalf; 'but if I do, then others will die, I fear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'You will need every man and more,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Darkness is passing,' said Gandalf, 'but it still lies heavy on this City.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" cried Gandalf, springing forward to the stone stair before the door."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even as Gandalf and Pippin ran forward, they heard from within the house of the dead the voice of Denethor crying: 'Haste, haste!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Gandalf sprang up the steps, and the men fell back from him and covered their eyes; for his coming was like the incoming of a white light into a dark place, and he came with great anger."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He lifted up his hand, and in the very stroke, the sword of Denethor flew up and left his grasp and fell behind him in the shadows of the house; and Denethor stepped backward before Gandalf as one amazed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'You may,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then Gandalf seeing the madness that was on him feared that he had already done some evil deed, and he thrust forward, with Beregond and Pippin behind him, while Denethor gave back until he stood beside the table within."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then Gandalf revealed the strength that lay hid in him; even as the light of his power was hidden under his grey mantle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'He calls,' said Gandalf, 'but you cannot come to him yet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Authority is not given to you, Steward of Gondor, to order the hour of your death,' answered Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Such counsels will make the Enemy's victory certain indeed,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'But I say to thee, Gandalf Mithrandir, I will not be thy tool!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'What then would you have,' said Gandalf, 'if your will could have its way?'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'To me it would not seem that a Steward who faithfully surrenders his charge is diminished in love or in honour,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Before Gandalf could hinder him he thrust the brand amid the fuel, and at once it crackled and roared into flame."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf in grief and horror turned his face away and closed the door."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion,' said Gandalf: Then he turned to Beregond and the Lord's servants that stood there aghast."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then Gandalf and Beregond taking up the bier bore it away towards the Houses of Healing, while behind them walked Pippin with downcast head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But the servants of the Lord stood gazing as stricken men at the house of the dead; and even as Gandalf came to the end of Rath Dínen there was a great noise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then in terror the servants fled and followed Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'The Prince of Dol Amroth is in command in the absence of the Lord,' said Gandalf; 'but since he is not here, I must take this on myself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But even as Gandalf and his companions came carrying the bier to the main door of the Houses, they heard a great cry that went up from the field before the Gate and rising shrill and piercing into the sky passed, and died away on the wind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Gandalf's face was grave and sad, and bidding Beregond and Pippin to take Faramir into the Houses of Healing, he went up on to the walls nearby; and there like a figure carven in white he stood in the new sun and looked out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" then I have guessed rightly,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When we found that you were not with them, Gandalf sent me to look for you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was not long before Gandalf himself came in search of them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf went from one to the other full of care, and he was told all that the watchers could hear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And so the day passed, while the great battle outside went on with shifting hopes and strange tidings; and still Gandalf waited and watched and did not go forth; till at last the red sunset filled all the sky, and the light through the windows fell on the grey faces of the sick."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And Gandalf, who stood by, said: 'Men may long remember your words, Ioreth!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then Gandalf went out in haste, and already the fire in the sky was burning out, and the smouldering hills were fading, while ash-grey evening crept over the fields."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And there came Gandalf on foot and with him one cloaked in grey; and they met before the doors of the Houses of Healing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And they greeted Gandalf and said: 'We seek the Steward, and men say that he is in this House."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And Gandalf answered: 'She lies within and is not dead, but is near death."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'I have come because Gandalf begs me to do so,' he said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But it is my counsel that Gandalf should rule us all in the days that follow and in our dealings with the Enemy.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then Gandalf said: 'Let us not stay at the door, for the time is urgent."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And with that they passed into the House; and as they went towards the rooms where the sick were tended Gandalf told of the deeds of Éowyn and Meriadoc."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'And if not,' said Gandalf, 'I will ride to Lossarnach with Ioreth behind me, and she shall take me to the woods, but not to her sisters."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'He is nearly spent,' said Aragorn turning to Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And he left the chamber with Gandalf and Imrahil; but Beregond and his son remained behind, unable to contain their joy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As he followed Gandalf and shut the door Pippin heard Ioreth exclaim: 'King!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'My friend,' said Gandalf, 'you had horses, and deeds of arms, and the free fields; but she, born in the body of a maid, had a spirit and courage at least the match of yours."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'He lies nearby in this House, and I will go to him,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf and Pippin came to Merry's room, and there they found Aragorn standing by the bed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'They will indeed,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And kissing Merry he went out, and Gandalf went with him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Except Gandalf, of course."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aragorn and Gandalf went now to the Warden of the Houses of Healing, and they counselled him that Faramir and Éowyn should remain there and still be tended with care for many days."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'As for Faramir,' said Gandalf, 'he must soon learn that his father is dead."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'For the faces of Aragorn and Gandalf are grave."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And there they took counsel together with Gandalf and Aragorn and the sons of Elrond."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'My lords,' said Gandalf, 'listen to the words of the Steward of Gondor before he died: _You may triumph on the fields of the Pelennor for a day, but against the Power that has now arisen there is no victory_."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'That would be no new counsel,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'He is not yet sure,' said Gandalf, 'and he has not built up his power by waiting until his enemies are secure, as we have done."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Let none now reject the counsels of Gandalf, whose long labours against Sauron come at last to their test."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'That is true,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'No, he will try to trap the fly and take the sting,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Legolas and Gimli were to ride again together in the company of Aragorn and Gandalf, who went in the van with the Dúnedain and the sons of Elrond."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But against this Gandalf had spoken urgently, because of the evil that dwelt in the valley, where the minds of living men would turn to madness and horror, and because also of the news that Faramir had brought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Gandalf and Aragorn rode with the vanguard to the entrance of Morgul Vale and looked on the evil city."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ever and anon Gandalf let blow the trumpets, and the heralds would cry: \"The Lords of Gondor are come!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There was Gandalf as chief herald, and Aragorn with the sons of Elrond, and Éomer of Rohan, and Imrahil; and Legolas and Gimli and Peregrin were bidden to go also, so that all the enemies of Mordor should have a witness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Where such laws hold,' said Gandalf, 'it is also the custom for ambassadors to use less insolence."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But this time thou hast stuck out thy nose too far, Master Gandalf; and thou shalt see what comes to him who sets his foolish webs before the feet of Sauron the Great."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" said Gandalf sternly, thrusting him back; but the Messenger laughed aloud."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'I do not wish to deny them,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Name the terms,' said Gandalf steadily, but those nearby saw the anguish in his face, and now he seemed an old and wizened man, crushed, defeated at last."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Gandalf said: 'This is much to demand for the delivery of one servant: that your Master should receive in exchange what he must else fight many a war to gain!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It seemed then to Gandalf, intent, watching him as a man engaged in fencing with a deadly foe, that for the taking of a breath the Messenger was at a loss; yet swiftly he laughed again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" said Gandalf suddenly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Before his upraised hand the foul Messenger recoiled, and Gandalf coming seized and took from him the tokens: coat, cloak, and sword."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Upon the one hill he stood with Gandalf, and there fair and desperate was raised the banner of the Tree and Stars."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Pippin had bowed crushed with horror when he heard Gandalf reject the terms and doom Frodo to the torment of the Tower; but he had mastered himself, and now he stood beside Beregond in the front rank of Gondor with Imrahil's men."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I can't think somehow that Gandalf would have sent Mr. Frodo on this errand if there hadn't a' been any hope of his ever coming back at all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'But do you remember Gandalf's words: _Even Gollum may have something yet to do?_ But for him, Sam, I could not have destroyed the Ring."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Upon the hill-top stood Gandalf, and he was white and cold and no shadow fell on him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As if to his eyes some sudden vision had been given, Gandalf stirred; and he turned, looking back north where the skies were pale and clear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Gandalf lifted up his arms and called once more in a clear voice: 'Stand, Men of the West!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then Gandalf, leaving all such matters of battle and command to Aragorn and the other lords, stood upon the hill-top and called; and down to him came the great eagle, Gwaihir the Windlord, and stood before him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Twice you have borne me, Gwaihir my friend,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And he lifted up Gandalf and sped away south, and with him went Landroval, and Meneldor young and swift."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With that Gandalf stood before him, robed in white, his beard now gleaming like pure snow in the twinkling of the leafy sunlight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At last he gasped: 'Gandalf!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'A great Shadow has departed,' said Gandalf, and then he laughed and the sound was like music, or like water in a parched land; and as he listened the thought came to Sam that he had not heard laughter, the pure sound of merriment, for days upon days without count."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'The fourteenth of the New Year,' said Gandalf; 'or if you like, the eighth day of April in the Shire reckoning."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'The King of Gondor and Lord of the Western Lands,' said Gandalf 'and he has taken back all his ancient realm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'The clothes that you wore on your way to Mordor,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When they were washed and clad, and had eaten a light meal, the Hobbits followed Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then Gandalf came and in his arms, to the wonder of Frodo, he bore the sword and the elven-cloak and the mithril-coat that had been taken from him in Mordor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Tonight at least you should wear one,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Frodo gave way; and Gandalf, as if he were their esquire, knelt and girt the sword-belts about them, and then rising he set circlets of silver upon their heads."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And when they were arrayed they went to the great feast; and they sat at the King's table with Gandalf, and King Éomer of Rohan, and the Prince Imrahil and all the chief captains; and there also were Gimli and Legolas."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the meantime you can try Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At last the glad day ended; and when the Sun was gone and the round Moon rode slowly above the mists of Anduin and flickered through the fluttering leaves, Frodo and Sam sat under the whispering trees amid the fragrance of fair Ithilien; and they talked deep into the night with Merry and Pippin and Gandalf, and after a while Legolas and Gimli joined them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At length Gandalf rose."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With him were Éomer of Rohan, and the Prince Imrahil, and Gandalf robed all in white, and four small figures that many men marvelled to see."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then Frodo came forward and took the crown from Faramir and bore it to Gandalf; and Aragorn knelt, and Gandalf set the White Crown upon his head, and said: 'Now come the days of the King, and may they be blessed while the thrones of the Valar endure!'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In those days the Companions of the Ring dwelt together in a fair house with Gandalf, and they went to and fro as they wished."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And Frodo said to Gandalf: 'Do you know what this day is that Aragorn speaks of?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'As for Bilbo,' said Gandalf, 'he is waiting for the same day, and he knows what keeps you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Pippin,' said Frodo, 'didn't you say that Gandalf was less close than of old?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And Gandalf said: 'Many folk like to know beforehand what is to be set on the table; but those who have laboured to prepare the feast like to keep their secret; for wonder makes the words of praise louder."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There came a day when Gandalf could not be found, and the Companions wondered what was going forward."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Gandalf took Aragorn out from the City by night, and he brought him to the southern feet of Mount Mindolluin; and there they found a path made in ages past that few now dared to tread."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And Gandalf said: 'This is your realm, and the heart of the greater realm that shall be."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Not for long now,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And Gandalf coming looked at it, and said: 'Verily this is a sapling of the line of Nimloth the fair; and that was a seedling of Galathilion, and that a fruit of Telperion of many names, Eldest of Trees."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And Frodo when he saw her come glimmering in the evening, with stars on her brow and a sweet fragrance about her, was moved with great wonder, and he said to Gandalf: 'At last I understand why we have waited!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For the other Companions steeds were furnished according to their stature; and Frodo and Samwise rode at Aragorn's side, and Gandalf rode upon Shadowfax, and Pippin rode with the knights of Gondor; and Legolas and Gimli as ever rode together upon Arod."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then Treebeard praised all their deeds, of which he seemed to have full knowledge; and at last he stopped and looked long at Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'To see how your work goes, my friend,' said Gandalf, 'and to thank you for your aid in all that has been achieved.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'The New Age begins,' said Gandalf, 'and in this age it may well prove that the kingdoms of Men shall outlast you, Fangorn my friend."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Treebeard gave Gandalf a long look, a most cunning look, Merry thought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" asked Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'I observe, my good Fangorn,' said Gandalf, 'that with great care you say _dwelt_, _was_, _grew_."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Now do not tell me, Gandalf, that I promised to keep him safe; for I know it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'You may be right,' said Gandalf; 'but this snake had still one tooth left, I think."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'You know the answers,' said Gandalf: 'no and no."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Then once more you are going the wrong way,' said Gandalf, 'and I see no hope in your journey."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Wormtongue only shot a glance of his bleared eyes full of terror at Gandalf, and then shuffled quickly past behind Saruman."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Yes, I think you had better do that,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They had journeyed thus far by the west-ways, for they had much to speak of with Elrond and with Gandalf, and here they lingered still in converse with their friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To their delight Gandalf said: 'I think I shall come too."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I think Gandalf might have shown me round a bit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The next day Gandalf and the hobbits took leave of Bilbo in his room, for it was cold out of doors; and then they said farewell to Elrond and all his household."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" said Gandalf quietly as he rode by Frodo's side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" there are some wounds that cannot be wholly cured,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf did not answer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He looked at them with fear and suspicion; but when he saw that Gandalf was there, and that his companions were hobbits, in spite of their strange gear, then he brightened and wished them welcome."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'And there you'll hear later all that we say, and more,' laughed Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But I'm right glad to see you, and none more than Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And you'll be taking your horse to his stable yourself Gandalf; I don't doubt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'That is just what we should like, too,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They put him in a large chair by the wood-fire, and Gandalf sat on the other side of the hearth, and the hobbits in low chairs between them; and then they talked for many times half an hour, and exchanged all such news as Mr. Butterbur wished to hear or give."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You don't say, Master Gandalf!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'I will indeed,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And Gandalf, too, was now riding on his tall grey horse, all clad in white with a great mantle of blue and silver over all, and the long sword Glamdring at his side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'I expect it has,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'You will be let alone, Barliman,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'The Rangers go there,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'He will,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not but what my beer's good, Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Better times, for Bree at any rate,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Bree folk were all out to see them off, and were in merrier mood than they had been for a year; and those who had not seen the strangers in all their gear before gaped with wonder at them: at Gandalf with his white beard, and the light that seemed to gleam from him, as if his blue mantle was only a cloud over sunshine; and at the four hobbits like riders upon errantry out of almost forgotten tales."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Deep in, but not at the bottom,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'I am with you at present,' said Gandalf, 'but soon I shall not be."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'As well as ever, you may be sure,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'There weren't any gates, you mean,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He turned Shadowfax off the Road, and the great horse leaped the green dike that here ran beside it; and then at a cry from Gandalf he was gone, racing towards the Barrow-downs like a wind from the North."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A little mischief in a mean way: Gandalf warned me that you were still capable of it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gandalf would look after your affairs.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As he turned and came towards them Frodo saw that Gandalf now wore openly upon his hand the Third Ring, Narya the Great, and the stone upon it was red as fire."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then those who were to go were glad, for they knew that Gandalf also would take ship with them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was not Sam, though, that gave you away this time, but Gandalf himself!'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'Yes,' said Gandalf; 'for it will be better to ride back three together 'than one alone."}
