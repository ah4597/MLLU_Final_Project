{"prompt":"","completion":" How are you feeling, Harry?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And you told us that you spent some time with Parkinson and Zabini, so you’re also on good terms with his friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of course, Madam."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Let’s end early. It is Friday."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sleep well, okay, Harry?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Harry, what’s gotten in to you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If it gets bad, we can take you to the Infirmary."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And not due to a certain Slytherin you were obsessed with during sixth year?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No, we can’t. Do your little thing with Malfoy, then."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Harry, you’re almost late!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It’s Malfoy, isn’t it? I heard you had a Seeker’s game with him this morning."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Enough Quidditch. Library. Work."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I got your message. What’s wrong?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Harry? Are you ready to tell us?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Harry? We’ll always be your friends, regardless."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You’ve been a lot happier lately, and you’ve stopped sneaking out at night."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yes, we knew. But the point is, soon after you stopped, you started taking breakfast in the kitchens."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I think the Dursleys are the kind of people who are homophobic and they probably told you blatantly wrong information."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It’s okay if you’re gay, or bisexual, Harry. We’ll still love you. We’ll still be friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And you’re on first-name basis."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Glad to be so interesting"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ginny, what’s wrong? What happened?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet I’m the one intended to give you heirs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I—I think it’s called agoraphobia."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Something about—about open spaces makes me panic."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I don’t know. It’s not like it’s rational."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It’s probably from being in that cell for so long."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There was nothing—It was like a void. Everyone was dead. No one was going to come for me. I was just there, and I didn’t even know how long it had been."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I don’t know. I suppose my horror exceeded my fear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I just bled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The cell was kept clean, but there was nothing provided."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I think that you are evil and inhuman."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The feeling is decidedly mutual."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I suppose your master was quite pleased with you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What is it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My brain feels cold. What did you do to me?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It feels like I’m dead."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You’re being different to me now. You’re less mean. Why are you even doing this for me?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Are you reading my mind?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Well, this has all been very illuminating. I won’t disturb your reading further."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I’m Hermione Granger, this is Ron Weasley and Draco Malfoy. I’m afraid you’re in tremendous danger. We’re here to help."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Harry, please, listen to me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The same thing happened to me. To all of us."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If you’d like, we can tell you more — and there’s something you should know, Harry. There are people after you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And they’re you, and you’re right here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Besides us. Besides us, Harry, you know what we’re talking about. You can feel it, can’t you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That went well. He told us where he worked!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There are loads of theories about it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is there somewhere we can go, Harry?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Malfoy, the Statute."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I’m afraid it might take more than that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh, dear. May as well come out and say it, shall we? Harry, you’re a wizard."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Some think maybe the Muggles who raised you managed it somehow, like they emigrated to somewhere unreachable, and somehow the magical trace was disrupted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Well, you’re in terrible danger, Harry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You were under some sort of protection when you still lived with your family, so long as you were under seventeen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It’s not a secret."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We don’t say it out loud."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Well done, Harry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We’ll teach him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh, I was thinking we’d probably track him for a while until something goes terribly wrong."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What? You saw him?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh, honestly. You'd think they'd have a bit more sense."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I said I believed you, didn't I? Now, what do you need help with?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No. But it might offer a new perspective. Would you mind if I accessed the memory?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You know I won't."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Have you visited Eeylops?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh. Tea's getting cold."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Anyway. This is a start. What do you think it means?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Maybe he was getting it resized because of recent weight loss."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A law used to exist, stating that those who knew the whereabouts of felons, but didn't report them straight away, could be arrested for hindering prosecution."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I didn't finish the question."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yes. You do that, and come and tell us all about it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Maybe you should have asked Malfoy where he is, then."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You've had dreams of real events before, Harry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" From what you said, the cliffs were treacherous."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Do you think he was depressed at all?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Well, I'd better be going. Let me know if you have any new leads."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This sounds familiar. Remember when you told me about your dreams, a while ago?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" An exceptional Legilimens can construct visions, hallucinations."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Was it stress?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Will they just reset it… after?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What will you be learning, exactly?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As bad as you’ve had it from them, you know how horribly they’ve treated me since back in first year."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Can you really blame me for being worried?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Please be careful, Harry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I really should be going, Harry; I feel like I’m shirking my responsibilities as prefect. Can we meet up tomorrow?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Let’s meet in the library."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We’re not actually going to use any magic in Defense Against the Dark Arts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She’s refusing to teach any of the practical work."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She said that learning the theory should be enough to help us pass our O.W.L.s."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How could Dumbledore allow this to happen?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She’s a terrible teacher, and we’re never going to pass our O.W.L.s, and I’m not going to get a good job after leaving Hogwarts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It’s clearly propaganda!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I don’t think you know, but it looked so strange from the perspective of anyone who wasn’t you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You just appeared with Cedric’s body, saying that You-Know-Who was back, but there wasn’t any proof."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We’ll figure out something. We always do."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It’s so odd without you there, Harry. I think everyone misses you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ginny and I were talking at lunch today how strange it was to not have you in the tower."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Angelina Johnson was having a near-complete breakdown last night."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She’s not stupid. I think she’s just angry at the situation she’s found herself in."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I’ve been reading."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh, no. Um. I had a question."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I don’t know if it’s somehow weird for me to ask this, but I feel like I’m the only person who doesn’t know what’s going on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Has Neville and some other boys in Eighth Year grown a lot over the summer?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I feel like they have, but it seems like I’m the only person confused by it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is that usual?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ginny, I don’t know what’s happening to me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Was I poisoned?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I have already been an adult for nearly two years. I’m turning nineteen tomorrow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Understood to be a Muggle-born?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is there something wrong with me?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So, I’m a magical broodmare?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I'm afraid that’s going to have to wait. I am not interested in having children for at least six years."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Do you mean to say that I need to find someone to shag all week and you’re suggesting I just proposition Neville?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I don’t want some boy I hardly know having sex with me because I’m in heat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yes. It's over now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No. It's not anything like that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I don't know what I can do to make it up to him if he feels like I assaulted him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I thought that might be the case, based on my reading."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No. Sorry. It became difficult to focus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Flying cars are certainly more terrifying."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Let's see. Ron is due for a new cauldron. I'd like a new rune set."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Harry, I have here that you're to get new robes. Maybe we could all meet back at Flourish and Blotts after?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ron, you're meeting your mum at Gringotts, don't forget."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Brooms are not shes, I hate to break it to you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Neither Slytherin nor Hufflepuff were damaged as much in the battle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thank you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No, apparently. I guess Neville's developed a snoring problem."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Professor Snape!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yes, Professor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That's a good point."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh my God, you cannot Apparate in Hogwarts castle!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Where have you people been studying?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Take your shoes and socks off, Harry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She's right, you know."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I didn't say it was fair. I only said it was right."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I need to talk to Professor Sinistra. Meet you in the foyer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That can't be right."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I heard he had to abide the law and all Hogwarts rules."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I'm guessing he's just working hard to get good marks because he knows how hard it's going to be for him after he leaves here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Are you really?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I've learnt all our set books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 'm Hermione Granger by the way, who are you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You're in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts, you know."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I guess I should be going, now that you found Trevor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That sounds like a bad soap opera. Are you sure?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Well, yes, but you're more likely to know you're name than something that happened over a millennium ago?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How does your SCAR hurt, Harry?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Why do you put up with him?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But he doesn't seem like a very pleasant person."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Fair enough. Now, what do you mean he supports Death Eaters? As in Voldemort?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How do they manage to keep from marrying Muggles or half-bloods?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I mean, there can't be very many proper Pureblood families, can there?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But what do you mean by 'old family.' Aren't all families equally old?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I do not! It's just that rules are put into place for our protection and as such we should follow them and not flaunt our disregard for them!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Why? Because you could have gotten seriously injured; what more reason do I need?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I suppose I'll have to go to make sure you don't get yourself killed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Although for the record, this totally counts as endangering others."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I've read all about them! You've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking at all, I saw him!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Okay, I'll bite. If it wasn't Snape, who was cursing your broom?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Shall we go and have a look at our new room?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We need to be studying, Ron, and you know it. We missed practically a whole year."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I really don’t think that’s a good idea."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You heard Professor McGonagall, we’re meant to be setting a good example to the rest of the school."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All right. But just this one evening. This is our most important school year, and I want to make the most of it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Come on. We’ll be late for our first lesson."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh, let him have it, Petra."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Mandy, can I see that page again? The one with the chart showing the decline in the Merpeople population?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We’re just collecting some specimens of the plants growing here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It’s not actually for schoolwork."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It’s just that we’ve got a theory about how the aquatic plant life here might use moonlight to photosynthesise, so we’re taking some samples to check."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Do you think that’s enough now?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It turns out Mandy and I have quite a lot in common."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Daphne’s top of her House in Potions, actually. It’s just nice to have company."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It must be. Oh well, I guess you can stay out of his way most of the time. Does he say much?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Are you sleeping any better?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of course I am, I’ve got loads to do. But we came out for a quick break. The tea is just to keep warm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was Millicent’s idea, and I have to say it’s quite delicious."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Let’s go for a walk, then. You too, Harry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I’ll see you back in the library in a bit."}
