{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet offers you a massage, and things become more heated than you expected."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As you reach the final step, Emet-Selch appears from the aether to study your wayward companions."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Tired warrior?” Emet questions, copying your stance against the tree."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet raises an inquisitive brow at you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet looks surprised a moment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Minfilia is fast asleep in Thancred’s arms, but it doesn’t stop him from silently snarling at Emet as he passes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet smirks and shrugs theatrically as you shoot him a withering glare."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “How interesting,” Emet says, pondering your words as you come to a halt before a curtained off building."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “This,” says the Vii, “is where you shall stay tonight.” She motions to you and Emet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet saunters in behind you, the smirk on his face extremely loud."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That’s not good for your health,” Emet points out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet hums to himself, thinking hard, before he comments."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh come now my dear, surely a massage is not a foreign concept to you?” Emet rolls his eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet gives you a challenging stare."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet stands, removing his gloves with immaculate teeth, tossing them down on the table."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After a moment, the bed dips by your hip as Emet swings his leg over your hips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “So, Warrior, where is your pain,” Emet asks, smooth and gentle, quiet even."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You shiver at the cold touch of the lotion, but it slowly warms as Emet’s hands move, pressing and exploring softly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Careful warrior, make noises like that and I might get ideas,” Emet says, working his way down your arms and to your hands."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Suddenly, the air stands still for a moment, Emet looking at you looking at him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For one moment, you look at him differently, and have the horrible feeling that Emet might just break."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet buries his face in your neck, pulling you flush against his chest, picking up the pace."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It doesn’t take long, Emet biting your shoulder, shuddering silently as he goes over the edge, orgasming in silence as you come moments later."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You stay that way a moment, listening to your pulse thundering in your ears, hand lazily dancing patterns into Emet’s back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet looks down at you, lips kiss bruised, and hair wild with sweat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After you spend the night with Emet-Selch morning comes to the Greatwood, and with it a few surprises."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" *Domestic Emet with a tingle of angst* Emet-Selch has not moved since you first awoke, and you wonder if you should rouse him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet eyes the steaming plates."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet gives a mock sneer, moving so your noses almost touch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet makes a small noise in the back of his throat, a sound you aren’t quite sure the meaning of."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet’s cheeks are alight warmth, and you feel your own pulse booming thunderously through your veins."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet huffs out a laugh, grinding down softly on your thigh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch takes great pleasure in this revelation, laving his tongue down, down, before he stops right above your aching arousal."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet’s hand pulls your fist out of your mouth, twining your fingers with his."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet senses your finish, replacing his tongue with his other hand, deftly moving over your arousal."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet lays his head against your thigh, stroking your stomach as you come down from your high, warm and lazy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet chuckles, crawling up your body to kiss you lazily."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet hisses at the friction, bowing his head as you reach down to pull at the hem of the garment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet’s eyes explore yours, the silent question on his face loud in your mind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet shushes you, nuzzling his face into your neck as you breath, running his hands up and down your now sweat slicked sides."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet rocks his hips at your sound of approval and you gasp."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet,” you say, hips grinding down, “for the love of the Twelve, fuck me.” Emet suddenly pulls you up and into his lap, blunt fingernails ripping down your spine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet obliges, driving into you swiftly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You pitch forward, hands resting on Emet’s shoulders as he angles his hips, throbbing member slamming deep into your core."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet grows still at last, and you tremble as he pulls out, lowering you down on the bed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch watches as your thought process comes to an end, with a shake of your head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet grins filthily, “Who knew the Warrior of Light was such a minx."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet laughs evilly, swinging his legs off the bed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your feelings must show, because Emet’s eyes soften, and he reaches to cup your chin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The second Rak’tikan night is upon you, and Emet offers to show you wonders no one has seen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You startle, head whipping down to find Emet-Selch studying you curiously."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet saunters forward, leaning against the trunk in the empty spot next to your seated body."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is a man, an Ascian, shrouded in as many mysteries as you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet makes not a sound as you enjoy the melody of the night, the soft puffs of his breathing the only thing to betray his presence."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Unless, of course, you wanted to plunge to your death,” Emet says as he rouses you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Come,” Emet says, “Let's get you to bed before you somehow toss yourself to your doom."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch sighs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You step back, looking at Emet-Selch as he taps an impatient foot on the ground."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Perish the thought,” Emet exclaims, “Your friends already seem scandalized at the thought of me sharing your bed, imagine if you pointed that detail out.” He tilts his head impishly, “Thancred would behead me.” Emet’s smile drops after a beat, and he studies you intently."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your banter never ceased it seemed, but the moments it dropped Emet always looked at you like you were some impossible creature."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet slips away, and you become lost."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Traversing space outside an aetheryte path is rather hard on the mortal body,” Emet says to you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You don’t realize you’ve said that out loud until Emet responds."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You mumble an incoherent complaint and Emet huffs a laugh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You look at Emet confused."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet stands silent beside you, eyes roving your face as you take in all of the caves splendor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Some are bioluminescent worms,” Emet says, stepping behind you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet moves his mouth to your ear, equally quiet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet puts you down, and you gasp, feet hitting solid air."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet cuts you off with a flourish,” Trade secret my dear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet tries to touch a few, perhaps to create music of his own, but they curl up angrily, and his sneers at them, face dropping into a sullen pout."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Time moves slowly, as Emet’s eyes widen, surprise flitting across his golden irises."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet turns, walking into the portal, almost through before you lunge after him from your place on the ground."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch, wait!” you shout after him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With gray streaked hair framing his sharp jaw and slender neck, Emet-Selch is an all too familiar creature."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet removes his outer robe, helping you to move on top of it, its soft surface shielding your skin from the cold of the stone floor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Slowly, the tendrils caresses you, eliciting a tiny gasp from your lips, breaking away from Emet’s mouth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet sits back, hands resting on your abdomen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet!” Emet shudders at your call, the darkness around him growing denser by the second, and you can feel his need."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet startles, staring at you, seemingly just noticing your presence."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet shakes his head, and gives you a sad look, smiling ."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And then you are back, your orgasm ripping through you, Emet pressing his lips to yours."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet caresses your neck, face nuzzled into your hair as his breathing slows down, body draping over your own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet shushes you, moving his head to rest on your chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Regal and arrogant, Emet stands over you, blocking out the pale rays of the moon."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I can sense that Emet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet removes his hand from your neck, and you almost whine at the loss."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet follows suit, his lips twisted into a frown."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Whether they live or die should be none of our concern.” Emet declares."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet waves a hand in front of him, frustration lacing his words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You snort at his response, “What do you know of my importance, might I ask?” Emet gives you a heated look."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet cocks his head at you, strikingly similar to a curious bird."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet takes one step, then two, carefully closing the small distance that separates you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet hums, hands trailing down to knead at your rear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Look at you all flustered, Tsk.” Emet’s eyes grow soft, and distant."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I suppose I can make do with that,” Emet replies haughtily."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet startles out of his thoughts, eyes swiveling from the heavens to focus on your face in mild confusion."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aza hadn’t been the same since the whole Lightwarden and Emet-Selch business."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" While Emet-Selch’s  delightful  hospitality had a lingering effect on him, the pain and damage was mostly superficial at this point."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “After Emet-Selch has drastically reduced my tolerance to leave the Crystal Tower.” Emet-Selch & WoL - Idiot Emet-Selch had come to this unsatisfactory conclusion when he realised that said Warrior of Light had stormed Amaurot without a single plan of action."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch knew the second they stepped foot into his territory - he could practically  taste  that fractured soul screaming in agony from miles away - and had braced himself for some madcap plan akin to the giant Talos smashing through his simulacrum to get to him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch  did  have to admit that he was  mildly  impressed this half-broken thing was managing to shamble about like this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch even indulged in a little, private clap on his behalf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch almost felt bad at how pointless this show of stubbornness was, though."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch would make sure to track its reincarnation process this time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ‘Aza’ abruptly stopped, doubling over, and Emet-Selch watched in open interest as the Light  flared."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch sighed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was pathetic with how he was going on like this, and Emet-Selch didn’t want him  vomiting  his Light all over his precious Amaurot simulacrum."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch didn’t want that to happen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch grunted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No matter how many times Emet-Selch met this soul, broken apart, it carried on its originator’s will with  frustrating  dedication."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch didn’t know how  he  did it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch stared at it for a bit, considering."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It made Emet-Selch’s skin crawl, as it did every time he encountered a Sundered who looked at him with blank incomprehension, their memories of their  true selves  an empty, black void of  nothing,  ignorant of their true worth, of what they  were."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For that, Emet-Selch would  never  forgive  him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch clenched his hands hard enough to hurt - but after a moment relaxed them with a slow, heavy exhale."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch would find another fragment or wait for the reincarnation process to bring him back into contact with this one."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" and ruin everything as usual, then Emet-Selch would kill him, and see if there was anything to salvage from his soul before letting it re-enter the Lifestream."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sometimes, Emet-Selch  swore  he could see a glimmer of  knowledge  in him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch was going to extract his pound of flesh, slowly,  thoroughly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" WoL & Emet-Selch & Ryne - Spun Glass “I thought I made it clear that I wished to be alone?”   he said with feigned mildness, not turning to look,   “Emet-Selch.” “You failed to attend yet another meeting,”   Emet-Selch continued after a long, heavy pause, blatantly ignoring his bristling,   “That is unlike you, -̷̡̪̌͜-̸͇͔̻͈̦͎̯͔̏-̴̳̥̱̞̆̃̒̔̂́͋-̶͚̟͓̥͎̏̓͊̑͝-̶̛̫̼͍̗̭̗́͗̎͐̓̂͘͘͜͜-̵͙̱͉̤̱͛͐̊̏̍̒͝͠ͅ-̴̳͔̱̙̽͝.” The pleasant stillness of this shaded balcony suddenly felt chilly and unwelcoming, Emet-Selch’s presence a hot brand on the edge of his awareness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He shoved him out aggressively, and Emet-Selch retreated from that intimate place without a fuss."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “-̷̡̪̌͜-̸͇͔̻͈̦͎̯͔̏-̴̳̥̱̞̆̃̒̔̂́͋-̶͚̟͓̥͎̏̓͊̑͝-̶̛̫̼͍̗̭̗́͗̎͐̓̂͘͘͜͜-̵͙̱͉̤̱͛͐̊̏̍̒͝͠ͅ-̴̳͔̱̙̽͝,\" Emet-Selch crooned, his tone shifting into something placating,   “Refusing to contribute is not the answer.” “Your report stated that we have less than four weeks until it reaches Amaurot,”    Emet-Selch interrupted, his own tone growing short,   “We cannot debate and squabble over other potential solutions while the apocalypse is practically on our doorstep.” Emet-Selch had grown very still, and he felt anger - so much anger, bubbling in him, fizzing out, making it difficult to think straight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s minor betrayal was so petty in comparison to that, yet it hurt the most."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “-̷̡̪̌͜-̸͇͔̻͈̦͎̯͔̏-̴̳̥̱̞̆̃̒̔̂́͋-̶͚̟͓̥͎̏̓͊̑͝-̶̛̫̼͍̗̭̗́͗̎͐̓̂͘͘͜͜-̵͙̱͉̤̱͛͐̊̏̍̒͝͠ͅ-̴̳͔̱̙̽͝,”    Emet-Selch tried."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch gently nudged at the border of his soul, concerned, apologetic."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Mm,” Ryne was giving him a thoughtful look, “You said ‘Emet-Selch’ a few times, but the rest was… um, I didn’t understand the words very well.” Was he dreaming about Emet-Selch?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He had a faint impression of being annoyed at him, but that was pretty much the default emotion when dealing with Emet-Selch, so… Amaurotine!WoL+Emet-Selch+Hythlodaeus - Friends “Are you and Emet-Selch still fighting?” Hythlodaeus was unhappy, in the same way that Hades had been unhappy with him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It’s simply… you should make up with Emet-Selch before you leave,” Hythlodaeus said pointedly, “He will be simply intolerable if you left without a goodbye, and you cannot be so cruel as to inflict that on Amaurot in your absence.” Prometheus laughed quietly at that, his mood lifting at imagining the well respected Hades sulking and being bratty during the daily Convocation Meetings because of him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had to know that, but once more, that sentimental idiot was being led by his feelings, rather than rational thought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All he could do now was wait for the weapon to finalise, and after quickly checking the time, Prometheus decided he’d given Hythlodaeus long enough to smooth down Hades’s ruffled feathers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus didn’t fully understand, and neither did Hades, but they did indulge in his little vice where most would have looked down on him for his… flaw."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “... he can deal,” Prometheus muttered, tapping his mask and willing it and the hood to stay in place before turning on his heel and teleporting to Hades’s residence."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For someone dubbed ‘The Architect’, Hades’s residence was rather modest and discreet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Where most Convocation members tended to situate their homes in isolated corners of the city, to better focus over the din of millions of souls brushing up against their awareness, Hades was a weird one who enjoyed being right in the thick of it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus found it exhausting and irritating just during his working hours, so he honestly had no idea how Hades dealt with it 24\/7."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As befitting his status, Hades was on the top floor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He could sense Hythlodaeus and Hades in there - and no doubt they could sense  him  - but with him blocking everyone out, he couldn’t quite gauge the mood in there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He cautiously uncurled, filtering out the white noise of  millions, to feel Hythlodaeus’s flutter of concern and Hades’ bristling irritation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’s home was one of those new builds that occupied its own instance separated from Amaurot’s dimension, so it resembled a large house inside, despite occupying the space of a shoebox room in Amaurot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was Hades’s ‘great achievement’ that had him considered for the Emet-Selch title all those centuries ago, as it cut down on the housing crisis by allowing for more homes built on a smaller area."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus still hadn’t figured out how he did it, something Hades was still  insufferably  smug about to this day."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With how long you loitered out there, I thought you were going to run away,” Hades said the second Prometheus stepped into the drawing room, where he received his closest friends regularly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was slouched in his usual squashy armchair, with Hythlodaeus on the sofa across from him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’m here to extend an olive branch,” Prometheus mumbled, shifting his weight as he felt Hades prod at his soul’s border."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Kindly, Hades blocked that noise out for him, and he relaxed a fraction, “If you’d accept it.” “Hmm…” Hades drew out, and across from him Hythlodaeus was watching them both hawkishly, his soul nudging at them to  play nice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Are you still departing for the outer regions tomorrow?” Hades asked idly, and his soul felt like the soft pawprints of a cat walking up and down his spine, showing none of the irritation Prometheus had felt outside."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I know,” Hades interrupted, “I still don’t like it, but… Hythlodaeus was  very  persuasive in reminding me that you would be delivering an important contribution with this expedition.” Prometheus waited, because Hades did like delivering a surprise stinger sometimes, but he was being sincere."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ah, Hythlodaeus was honestly a miracle worker, able to temper even Hades’s mercurial moods."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades waved a hand carelessly, summoning a platter of tea and treats with barely a thought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Yes, fine,” Hades grumbled, but it was mostly for show, “Come here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He filed the observations away, hopping up onto the armchair next to Hades’s."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What is that guise you’re wearing?” Hades asked, “You have a tail now.” “I think we should be deciding how to  stop  the plague first,” Hades countered, “Have you seen the proposal for the Zodiark Concept yet?” “Hm,” Hades sounded and felt entirely neutral."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I haven’t,” Hades said carefully, “But it’s our best option until we know more about the situation.” Hades seemed to think about for a long moment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus brightened, letting Hades feel his happiness from that agreement."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Thanks, Emet-Selch,” he said, glancing over to Hythlodaeus to give him a more subtle thanks for easing Hades up from his earlier snit by brushing up against his soul’s border like a purring cat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You once challenged me to a duel because I told you gargoyles are a tacky aesthetic,” Hades said flatly, looking back at him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked over to Hythlodaeus in open disbelief, as if to say ‘can you believe this?’ Though they bickered and argued often, there was something about Hades that always made him feel happy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He trusted Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Amaurotine!WoL & Emet-Selch & Hythlodaeus - Doom Hades’ voice filtered in like bad static, the familiar sight of his bedroom ceiling spinning like a demented merry-go-round."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A strained, tinny noise of agony left him, because everything was loud  (like that scream that scream that scream)  because Hades’s home was in the  middle of Amaurot  and millions of souls crashed over his bleeding borders, drowning him, and he couldn’t  get them out - Hades was now leaning over him, his mask nowhere to be seen, dark brown hair tumbling into his eyes, his hands clasped over Prometheus’s damp cheeks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was gently sheltering him from the din of Amaurot, and it felt like cold water splashed over a searing burn."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Prometheus,” Hades said, scandalously using his true name."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I am, he thought dizzily, but he realised that he was also shying away from Hades’s soul, scrunching tight like an animal dying under a low-sitting porch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades still nudged at him, trying to heal, and Prometheus stayed curled up, refusing to move."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hythlodaeus,” Hades muttered, leaning away, but still keeping his hands on his cheeks, “Call Hythlodaeus, now!” “Calling Hythlodaeus,”  a soft, artificial voice hummed, followed by a sleep-rough, familiar voice of,  “Emet-Selch?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He felt like a soaked sponge, water just running out of him, except it was aether, just pouring out - then a sensation like it was pouring back in, warm and gentle - Hythlodaeus  -and he uncurled, enough -  Hades and Hythlodaeus  - until his mind could think beyond  that scream  and  that pain  and  the Doom is coming I have to tell them that it is, that it is- He came back to himself sprawled out in Hades’s bed, sticky with sweat and limbs shaking violently, his soul feeling raw but with its borders restored, if tender."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was still blanketing him, keeping the worst of Amaurot’s din out, his hand on his shoulder."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Amaurot,” Hades said tightly, “You teleported into my bed, screeching like a dying animal.” Hades kept up the calming gentle vibes, despite the unhappy, tense expression on his face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Something,” he said, when Hades gave him a very cautious nudge, “Tried to claw into me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’s fingers clenched into a bruising grip on his shoulder, “There’s nothing there,” he said firmly, “I’ve checked,  thoroughly.” “Idiot,” Hades snapped, “You could have sundered yourself!” “Emet-Selch,” Hythlodaeus said softly, “We need to get him medical attention."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’s soul prickled almost possessively, blanketing tighter around him, feeling jagged and angry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus felt Hades pull away, and he panicked, gripping at his wrist blindly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades jumped."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’m not,” Hades said gently, “Repose.” Hades was  angry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus’s return hadn’t been missed, as he had practically broadcasted his agony all over Amaurot before Hades managed to mute it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades ground his teeth together so hard his jaw hurt, “For all his  cockiness,” he gritted out, “He knows when to tread cautiously."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He is clean,” Hades snapped."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades knew that they saw this as an opportunity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had been blocking their Zodiark Concept proposal with the excuse that they couldn’t hold a vote without everyone present, but if one of their own was hospitalised for severe injury, then… Hades almost objected - a week was  nothing  for them - but he remembered the state of Prometheus when he tumbled onto his bed, screaming like he was dying."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It had been awful, feeling his agony and terror just spilling out mindlessly, with Hades only barely able to staunch the bleed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Council were gazing at him expectantly, and Hades… Hades did not object."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 14th\\Emet - Intimacy (PWP kinda) “Hm?” Hades didn’t look up from some architect designs sprawled out on the table before him, “Combine what?” Hades paused, staring fixedly at the corner of one design sheet before slowly lifting his gaze to where Prometheus was sipping his coffee like he hadn’t just suggested something  totally  indecent over the breakfast table."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Uh huh,” Hades said, practically oozing doubt as he gave his friend a suspicious look."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In fact, knowing what Hades did about Prometheus, he could safely hypothesise that this ‘experiment’ would result in Prometheus caving first as he was  pathetically  sensitive if you knew the right places to touch- Abruptly, Hades found himself much more amicable to the idea, and he smiled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Well, if it’s for scientific curiosity,” Hades purred, “I’m interested.” Hades hummed, low in his throat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Without his mask in place, Hades had the total delight in watching Prometheus’s face flush, his gaze quickly dropping and looking away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After countless  centuries  with this man, Hades knew how to play him like a cheap fiddle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Admit it, you prefer it like this,” Hades drawled, reaching out to nudge his foot against Prometheus’s ankle, lazily reaching to the edge of his friend’s soul to brush up against is teasingly, “Being a pillow queen-” “I am  not  a pillow queen!” Prometheus huffed, going stiff-backed at Hades’s gentle touch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His pupils were dilated though, the blush high on his cheeks - he could feel the warm thrum of arousal twine through his friend’s soul, and Hades basked in it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So, Hades drew back, didn’t bother hiding his smirk when Prometheus let out a disappointed noise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Take initiative, then,” Hades challenged, “You did propose this experiment, after all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades gave him a flat look, but let it go."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Over a week later, long enough for Hades to sort of forget about the whole thing, Prometheus acted when his guard was at its lowest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It had been a satisfyingly productive day, one where Hades got to flex his Creation magics by constructing a brand new and modern building for the Bureau of Administration in only a handful of hours."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It’s been a while since I’ve seen you this tired,” Prometheus hummed as they entered Hades’s apartment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Call me that again, and I  will  turn you into an otter for a month,” Hades said without any heat, tugging his mask off and sweeping his hood back in one motion."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For a respected member of the Convocation, he was  shockingly  slovenly, even by Hades’s standards."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hey,” Prometheus continued as Hades debated whether or not to have a nap, “Why don’t we celebrate your achievement today?” “It’s hardly an achievement,” Hades said, “But if you’re giving me a gift, I won’t say no.” Hades had to think on it for a hot second, before remembering."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If you’re up for it,” Prometheus said, and Hades knew if he said no, his friend would back off instantly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades tilted his head, looked at Prometheus from beneath his eyelashes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’m not doing  all  the work,” Prometheus huffed, but he did snap his fingers and teleported them directly to Hades’s bed with their robes ‘helpfully’ vanishing along the way."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was unimpressed, sprawled out messily on his back as Prometheus sat proudly on his stomach, “That was shockingly lazy.” Interesting comparison to make, but not something Hades entirely disagreed with."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had the faintest sensation of something scratching lightly down his back, making his skin prickle pleasantly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades made a pleased noise, had to bite the inside of his cheek to stop his grin when Prometheus’s  reacted, pupils dilating at that quiet little noise as his arousal spiked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades almost forgot they were meant to be doing something else other than basking in each other until Prometheus started to jerkily, clumsily grind down against his belly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades blindly groped downwards, until he could dig his nails into Prometheus’s thighs - firm and taut with well-toned muscle, being one of the few Amaurotines who did  not  shirk heavy physical activity - arching his lower back to press up against him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It took Hades entirely by surprise, knocking him out of the relaxing, rhythmic flow of pleasure he’d sunk into - just in time to feel Prometheus release all over his stomach."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ah,” Hades murmured roughly, still a bit disorientated from the rough pause, as he opened his eyes to see Prometheus sitting stock still on his stomach, one hand over his mouth and clearly mortified at his very very  very  quick orgasm, “That was fast.” Hades gently scratched his fingernails down Prometheus’s still trembling thighs, then kneaded his knuckles into them, until his friend caught his breath and stopped looking ready to spontaneously combust on the spot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It’s fine,” Hades said honestly, smirking up at his embarrassed friend, “You lasted, oh, a few more seconds that I thought you would…” “Hades!” Prometheus huffed, bristling like an offended kitten, “As if you would have done any better!” Prometheus attempted to smother him with his own pillow, and after an  incredibly  childish tussle that was utterly unbefitting of two well respected members of the Convocation, they both sprawled out side by side on the bed, Hades dozy but content."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You  want  to keep mixing the two?” Hades asked curiously."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not particularly, but Prometheus did a lot of things Hades didn’t understand but still indulged him in."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades grunted, already closing his eyes and starting to doze."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades never knew why he played coy like that - in an hour or so he’d be like an octopus, clinging to him and squeezing the life out of him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But again, Prometheus did a lot of things Hades didn’t understand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If it hadn’t been for Hades’s quick thinking, if he hadn’t staunched the aether bleed the instant Prometheus had landed in his bed, he would’ve… Prometheus didn’t seem to be resting well either, slowly fighting through Hades’s sleep spell and rousing into aching consciousness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had tried to wrangle for his friend to stay in his lodgings, but Hythlodaeus managed to talk him out of it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus was going to be  furious  at Hades for breaking his promise, and Hades would get defensive and dig his heels in, and, oh, it was going to be a  nightmare to mediate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “...need to tell Hades... ” Prometheus didn’t seem to hear him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You need to tell Hades,” Prometheus rasped, “It’s- it’s important.” It should’ve been Hades, “With you injured, they said they couldn’t afford to wait for your return to vote, so he… he couldn’t do anything.” It was a weak excuse - Hades could have done several things to stall it further, but privately Hythlodaeus felt that Hades either genuinely thought the plan would work, or had been so shaken by Prometheus’s injuries he felt it was the  only  chance they had."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades always had a flaw of acting on feelings at inopportune times, and Hythlodaeus felt that vote was one of those."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Shhh, shh,” Hythlodaeus gently coaxed him to sit on the bed, relieved that he wasn’t shrugged off this time, “Emet-Selch didn’t know about… I’m sure, once they know it is the star itself, they’ll change course.” “Prometheus,” Hythlodaeus said softly, “Last night, Hades was terrified."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades kept you together long enough for them to fix you,” Hythlodaeus continued, “For those long hours he felt your agony like it was his own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You are,” Hythlodaeus murmured, gently tucking a wayward lock of dark hair behind Prometheus’s ear, “So, I think you should rest and speak to Emet-Selch after you feel less… raw.” Hythlodaeus internally sighed in relief, though he made a note to warn Hades to stay away for a few days until Prometheus’s temper had time to  really  cool down."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There was still that massive glassed crater a few miles beyond Amaurot’s city limits when he had a  genuine  fight with Hades two centuries ago, an event the pair of them refused to ever acknowledge."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Between the pair of them, they might be able to… come up with something, something that would sway Hades, and make everything right again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Prometheus’s final moments came, Emet-Selch’s love was briefly stronger than Zodiark’s grip."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch crouched down next to his long-time friend, his lifetime partner, his newest enemy, and sighed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch itched to remove it, but he held himself back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Killing Prometheus… Emet-Selch found he could not do it, even with His command thundering through his heart."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’re dying anyway,” Emet-Selch said, staring up at the sky, where their Gods fought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch watched him from his peripheral."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But this time, he didn’t ask Emet-Selch to help him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What did She take?” Emet-Selch asked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s fingers itched from an old, ancient habit to take Prometheus’s hand in his own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch clenched his hands, a pain so visceral it was almost numbing piercing through his heart at the thought of- of Prometheus  not remembering."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch turned to him, unsure if he was feeling rage or despair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch was basically holding a shade of what was once Prometheus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What?” Emet-Selch rasped, “What, what did you want to save?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch - refused."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He pressed his palms flat against the unmoving chest, searched - dug deep, reached out for that familiar spark - Prometheus was a  brat, he would always try to block him out and hide himself if he was angry enough, but Emet-Selch  always  found him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades liked a methodical approach to his Concepts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He had good instincts, was very impulsive when it came to defining his Concepts, and Hades had only seen him sort-of plan something out on paper and pen  once, and that was to doodle some duck-beaver hybrid with ‘venomous?’ scrawled next to it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Prometheus,” Hades sighed exasperatedly, “What are you doing?” Hades dully watched as the pile rose to dangerous heights."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus, Hades tried."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hmm, it might make the walls look like they're made out of meat... Hey, Hades, what do you think of meat walls?” Hades felt his eyebrow twitch, unable to look away from the pile on the verge of imminent collapse, “ Stop  summoning marble before you end up crushing yourself to death."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades levelled a flat, heavy-lidded stare at him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ah, haha…” Prometheus laughed sheepishly, leaning back on his heels with his hands raised when Hades’s soul bristled at him, “I’m joking!” Hades sighed explosively, tapping his fingers against the nose of his mask."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If he didn’t want to work on this project, he only had to  say  and Hades would do it all by himself!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades vanished the unwanted stone with a sharp snap of his fingers before it inadvertently killed someone, looking back at his drawing board."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Firstly, we need to agree on how large we will make the extension, Hades began briskly, \"Some researchers have requested an outdoor area for a garden that isn't filled with man eating plants for once, so we need to divvy up our work area accordingly-\" Hades paused, mentally pulling up the blueprints for Igeyorhm’s home, before he fully processed what his friend said, \"Wait."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades frowned at him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Anyway, Prometheus continued hastily, ignoring the suspicious look Hades was shooting him, \"Her home design might fit in well with this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The boring block is a popular classic, Hades said dryly, and added in an undertone, \"Also, I was the one who designed Igeyorhm’s home…\" Hades closed his eyes for a good long moment, feeling a migraine coming on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was then that Hades realised his friend was fucking with him, “That.” “Prometheus,” Hades said mildly, “You are  really  getting on my last nerve.” He looked unfairly handsome there, his face exposed with his hood threatening to tip back from a strong gust of wind, his soul a lovely warm thing that kept nudging him playfully despite Hades exuding open irritation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It made it hard to stay angry at him, but Hades liked to think he was slowly developing a resistance to it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades smacked a freshly created mask right onto Prometheus's face, neutralising the hypnotic power of his stupidly handsome face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It reminded Hades of the death masks they put on the recently deceased, and something about it disquieted him for a brief moment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Look,” Hades said, deciding to be blunt, “If you don’t want to collaborate with me, you only have to say.” I’m not…” Prometheus trailed off when Hades gave him a firm look, and finally his shoulders dropped as he meekly bowed his head, pressing his fingers together."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Structures can’t be rushed,” Hades told him, “Some Concepts can be experimented and done impulsively, but  buildings  require strict and thorough planning, and ensuring your calculations match up before you so much as think about placing the first stone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had some theories on why that was, but felt it wouldn’t be constructive to explain."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus was  smart , he really was, but Hades also knew he was more of a kinaesthetic learner."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “How about this?” Hades tried, “You pitch ideas, and  I  see if they’re feasible and implement them.” Honestly, Hades would prefer doing all of the work."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Just...  sit there and look pretty,” Hades finally said, “It’ll motivate me.” Hades left him to it, turning back to his drawing board."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades really hoped none of the other council members came to check up on them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’ll tell you when to take breaks too,” Prometheus added when Hades started to get back to work, “So you don’t waste away like you usually do.” “Yes, fine,” Hades said distractedly, already absorbed in his work."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Their styles really did clash, but it didn’t mean they couldn’t compromise… it was just, Hades made a very strong mental note to never step inside a building Prometheus made with his own hands without conducting a thorough structural survey first."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Amaurotine!WoL + Emet-Selch Before Prometheus and Hades were members of the Convocation, they worked together in the Akadaemia’s ornithology department."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, for his methodical, careful approach to things, he tended to deal with the cataloguing and recommendations for new species within certain biomes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Were it not for his mentor assigning him to the ornithology department, his life’s trajectory might’ve taken a wildly different path to what it did - or it might’ve remained the same, for by then Prometheus and Hades’s fate was tied with red string."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It didn’t allow for a lot of time to scurry into the dusty archives where Hades sat, but Prometheus still made sure to visit as often as his breaks allowed - usually with a brand new idea for a feathered friend to bounce off of him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades always indulged Prometheus in these rambles, even if he didn’t care about the subject."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Only as an assistant technician, not trusted with anything of true importance, but it was still a  remarkable  position and Hades was honestly a little envious of him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus… Hades wouldn’t be surprised if he moved on from the Ornithology department within a decade or so - a relatively short time for an Amaurotine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had already heard some discussions, done in the background of the archive room between some researchers when his head had been buried so deeply in reports they must’ve overlooked him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Maybe it was petty jealousy, or maybe it was something else, but Hades didn’t like the thought of it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Morning, Hades!” Hades jerked out of his thoughts when Prometheus suddenly  yelled  down his ear, making him practically throw his unfinished report high in the air as his heart tried to leap out of his damned  chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ” Hades gasped, quickly snatching the report before it fluttered away, twisting in his seat to scowl at a grinning Prometheus, “I told you not to do that!” “It wasn’t my fault you were so lost in your head you didn’t hear me the first few times,” his friend drawled, sidling around his chair to rest his hip against the edge of Hades’s desk, “Is your report on the swans’ morphometric measurements really that interesting?” “You would hate them too after reading five thousand papers on their disgusting digestive system,” Hades muttered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades couldn’t help but smile when Prometheus’s soul bubbled with pure happiness and pride at that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus whisked the unfinished report out of Hades’s hands and, with a twist of his wrist, banished it into his own personal pocket dimension, “No, you’re not.” Hades’s eyebrow twitched."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You love me,” Prometheus shot back, and Hades shrugged in response."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Normally, Hades wouldn’t be allowed in these areas, but Prometheus being Prometheus, managed to somehow get them waved through various clearance doors with little hassle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades couldn’t help but look around when they finally reached Prometheus’s office, though really, it was more of a shoebox."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Is this a closet?” Hades asked dubiously."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked over various illustrations papering the walls of the tiny room - birds, mammals, insects, fish, landscapes - and then at the desk that must have been created to fit in here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was tinier than Hades’s desk, its surface a mess of crumpled papers, scribbles, pictures, as well as lifelike models of various bird skeletons."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “So,” Prometheus said, knocking Hades’ out of his half-formed calculations, “This is  strictly  a prototype, but if it passes approval than it can be seeded in the tropical swamps down south.” “It hasn’t even been  approved  yet, and you’re showing me?” Hades said, disbelieving."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As if it could be rejected, Hades thought exasperatedly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I hope you’re planning on showing Hythlodaeus too?” he asked, not moving away from Prometheus’s soul - which was, possibly, a little too intimate for this setting, but when his friend felt like this, this proud and happy, Hades couldn’t help but bask in it like a cat in a warm patch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He cleared some space on his small desk, carelessly knocking stuff to the floor - Hades winced - and snapped his fingers, drawing from interior inventory."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades automatically classified it as a Pelecaniforme, glancing over its characteristics to quickly define its habitat and role."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “‘Shoebill’?” Hades tilted his head, taking in its beak."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades let him ramble on, still studying the bird."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “-and that is why I decided on creating this,” Prometheus finished, and Hades tuned back in, guiltily realising he hadn’t listened to a word he just said, “So, what do you think?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked up where Prometheus was practically vibrating with anticipation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He found it strange that someone like him would be so eager for Hades’s approval, but he did selfishly like it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could just about see the flush underneath the edge of his mask - as well as feel his friend’s soul  heat up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I don’t think-” Hades began, but Prometheus had already whisked his example ‘Shoebill’ back into his inventory, and started ushering him out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You can come with me,” Prometheus said, ignoring Hades protests, “It’ll be fine.” “I’m not even  allowed  in here!” Hades spluttered, but Prometheus just waved away his complaints, keeping him in line with a very friendly, very  restraining, arm around his shoulders."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There were days where Hades wondered if Prometheus actually had a passion for Combat-magic."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He was skilled in it, created amazing but terrible things from it, but his soul had never quite  lit up  like it did when he showed Hades his Shoebill."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For he remembered a particular day, where Prometheus showed Hades a spell he had been working on for a while - ‘Death’, he had called it, the painless cessation of physical bodily functions to instantaneously kill the subject."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades remembered that day well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus contributed many dangerous, yet useful things to Amaurot as a Combat-spell specialist, but there were some days where Hades wondered if it would’ve been  better if he had stayed in ornithology."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus found Emet-Selch sitting in one of the fractured ruins of Amaurot, staring at Prometheus’s dead body."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch was the only other one he found that was still whole."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus approached Emet-Selch, intentionally making his footfalls heavy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Despite Zodiark’s Tempering, Emet-Selch had still somehow maintained some level of devotion to their wayward kin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To express relief that such a terrible and dangerous foe was  finally  dead… it might incur Emet-Selch’s rage."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Yes,” Emet-Selch said in a tone that was empty of any emotion, “He’s dead."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus hummed quietly, warily eyeing Emet-Selch’s too still form knelt down next to Prometheus’s body."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was a grief that paralysed, that killed, slowly, and Elidibus wondered if Emet-Selch really did survive - or if he was in the process of dying in a slower, crueller way than the rest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus had been Emet-Selch’s other half."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus had seen plenty of Amaurotines die of heartache, after Zodiark’s ascension, to recognise the beginning of it in Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s hands clenched, and he exhaled harshly, looking up at Elidibus with a dark, unreadable stare."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Something ugly, jagged, sharp, heaved through his cold, cold, cold soul, and Elidibus braced himself, telling himself that Emet-Selch was acting from grief, that he was not himself- But Emet-Selch did not attack."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “She  took everything,” Emet-Selch muttered, his tone venomous, “He couldn’t  remember my name."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If Emet-Selch were to find a shard strong enough to regenerate Prometheus, he would only get a faulty shade, an inferior parody."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And it seemed Emet-Selch hadn’t realised it yet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch let out a noise - it wasn’t a laugh, it was too raw and sharp for that, but it wasn’t a cry either."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “He ruined everything,” Emet-Selch said, partly to himself, dropping his hands from his hair, “Why did he  reject- ” Emet-Selch did not finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “His ‘true colours’...?” Emet-Selch whispered, then let out that ugly not-laughing noise, “You  never  knew Prometheus, none of you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “He just wanted to make birds,” Emet-Selch snarled out, despair making his voice thick, “Those silly, short-lived  insignificant  things!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Watched as Emet-Selch struggled to drag himself back under control, his soul a horrible, pitiful ball of grief."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I would have traded all of you, for him, in an instant,” Emet-Selch said very very quietly, looking back down at his friend, “Zodiark would have needed no one else, but him.” Emet-Selch abruptly stood up, and lifted his hand as if to snap."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus did not ask where Hades sent it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “... let’s see how big of a mess he made,” Emet-Selch said dully, his soul closed off and hard like stone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus bowed his head, wary of igniting Emet-Selch’s unpredictable temper, and murmured; “The world is in fourteen pieces, an ever expanding rift between them.” “Of course,” Emet-Selch huffed out, “Of course he had to blow up the world to get his point across.” Elidibus looked up at him in confusion, but Emet-Selch had turned away from him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I have gotten very good at fixing Prometheus’s messes, in the last few millennia,” Emet-Selch said, “I will find a solution to this one too.” Emet-Selch paused for a long moment, then replied, distantly, “Yes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus wondered what words Zodiark whispered to Emet-Selch - if he even listened."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As always, Emet-Selch had a blindspot the exact shape and size of Prometheus, something that Zodiark’s Tempering never  quite  cured him of."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It stood to reason that Emet-Selch might have been infected with such thinking, though the Tempering made betrayal from that corner impossible."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Amaurotine!WoL\/Emet-Selch (Kinda Porny) Hades only realised this when he opened the front door to it and almost stepped into a  furnace."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I mean, fucking- Hades,  I need assistance!” Hades eyed the smoke pouring out through the door with trepidation, his nose and throat already burning."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades!”  Prometheus yelped again, this time with more urgency."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “The things I do…” Hades sighed, snapping his fingers to put up a small barrier around him to fend off the worst of the smoke and heat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Last time Prometheus’s workshop was like this he had a runaway lava golem oozing over everything, and Hades ended up almost catching fire (not  an experience he wanted a repeat of)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hi,” Prometheus wheezed as Hades stood and stared in disbelief, “Please help me.” “...how long have you been like this?” Hades asked in morbid curiosity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades couldn’t hold back the amused grin, before he focused on the situation on hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades felt out the aether, humming when he realised his friend had somehow managed to slow the flow of time within the barrier’s sphere of influence, massively reducing the speed of the star’s collapse."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Had he bastardised Hades’s individual instance Concept and did a pocket version of it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades supposed he could just launch the damn thing in an ejection teleport, but to where?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Its supernova would be small enough not to cause too many ripples - though, if someone had a rift gate open in whatever area Hades dropped this, they’d get a very nasty surprise... “Hades,” Prometheus grunted as he made his calculations for its safe and non-exploding teleport, “Can you  hurry it up?” “Excuse me for not wanting to have this literally explode in my face,” Hades said dryly, “Now hold still, before I  accidentally  teleport you with it.” Doing one last check of his calculations, Hades snapped his fingers and whisked the ticking time bomb into the rift."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hmm…” Hades daintily waved a hand in front of his face, “Your workshop is a mess, Prometheus.” Hades blithely ignored it, “The Akadaemia has a room specifically designed for stellar nucleosynthesis experiments."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But despite his words, Hades held off on the lecture."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades frowned, “And you chose a portable supernova?” “Why?” Hades interrupted him tiredly, “Why  would we need to throw supernovae at things?” Hades heaved a sigh that came from the very depths of his exasperated soul."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades smirked, watching Prometheus irritably shuffle his weight, “Yes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He had a mild tan too, freckles over the bridge of his nose, which Hades idly admired for a quick moment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The workshop practically  buzzed  with his friend’s aether, electrified and settling from the excitement, and Hades basked in it like it was pleasantly warm sunshine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I feel like you’re going to eat me, staring at me like that,” Prometheus said, nudging Hades’s out of his purring thoughts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Mmm…” Hades leaned back on his heels, “Just thinking that this is a nice look for you.” “It reminds me of something,” Hades said simply."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A lazy, confident little tilt to his lips that never failed to irritate and hypnotise Hades in equal measure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “... Hades, why  are  you here?” Prometheus asked suddenly, his voice a very low, hypnotic purr, “Because I distinctly remember you telling me that you were going to be absent for about a  month, and it’s only been just over a week.” Of course, he wanted to make  Hades  say it, but he wasn’t going to play along."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His hand closed around Hades’s, the physical contact making their spiritual one curl warmly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades knew Prometheus’s soul better than his own, the sensation of it unfurling for him, letting him glimpse the true depths of it (and it was endless, Prometheus’s soul, like staring into a bottomless ocean and understanding its wondrous and  terrifying potential)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No one else had a soul like his, and it was the only one Hades would ever tolerate touching him like this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades felt he never measured up quite as well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Of course you do,” Prometheus murmured, and with a guilty wince Hades realised he let that thought travel a bit too close to the forefront of his mind, “I love your soul, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had a faint feeling of soft touches, down along his spine, as Prometheus’s soul sunk that little bit deeper into him, and he found himself swaying slightly, the  weight  of his friend taking his breath away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was a struggle, sometimes, to take in a soul so overwhelming it would crack a lesser Amaurotine, but somehow Hades managed it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades struggled to pay attention to the physical world and the gently lapping, pressing feeling of Prometheus’s soul sinking into every inch of him, and probably would have walked blindly into a wall if it hadn’t been for his friend’s guiding hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As it was, they half-tumbled onto a desk, clumsily, both of them drunk on each other, paper crinkling beneath Hades’s back, Prometheus pressing down on him, heavy, something clattering onto the floor as it was swept off the desk and- “Hades,” Prometheus murmured breathlessly against his mouth, his soul a bright, burning star sitting heavy right in his heart, resonating and so intimately twisted with his own soul Hades couldn’t tell where they began and ended, “You are…” Prometheus trailed off with a raw noise, one Hades quietly echoed, as an intimate pleasure than ran soul deep started to crest - then dip - then crest higher, like lapping waves, a heat independent from the lingering fire starting to creep over Hades’s skin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Beneath his eyelashes, Hades could see Prometheus pull back, flushed and dark-eyed, expression and soul both  hungry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades… needed a moment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As the communicator’s light started blinking, indicating that it was taking a no doubt  very  angry voicemail, Prometheus looked back at Hades with a small grimace."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “A little,” Hades admitted, realising that he was lying on a paperweight, judging by the sharp pain jabbing into his lower back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’ve seen your bath,” Hades huffed, “It won’t fit both of us.” “I’ll adjust it,” Prometheus started to smile, leaning in close until their foreheads were touching, his hands resting atop of Hades’s thighs, his soul brushing up slow, and warm, and long against his, “Or, you can sit in my lap~” “Hm,” Hades pressed his hand against Prometheus’s chest, slowly pushing him back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I always pamper you,” Hades said flatly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All while privately wondering if Hades had done that on purpose.)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So, when Prometheus, Hades, and Hythlodaeus reached fifty years of age, still so very young by Amaurotine’s standards, they were given to the Mentor known as Metis."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Beside him, Hades felt bored and tired."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “To observe,” Hades said in that low, drawl of his, “And see how others do it.” He had excelled in what lessons Mentor Metis had given them, had beaten Hythlodaeus and Hades in vigorous debate (though, Hades was very tricky to argue with, since he had this way of wording things that made his meaning obscure)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades shrugged, still sleepy-eyed, and Hythlodaeus looked out at the intimidating crowd with open uncertainty."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This was  way more  intense than the friendly debates Mentor Metis set up between him and Hades and Hythlodaeus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He jumped a little at Hades’s voice, and he turned to see his friend approaching with Hythlodaeus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Are you debating?” Hades asked them, but he was looking at Prometheus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus didn’t dare say anything, because Hades would know something was wrong the second he opened his mouth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades huffed, “Considering he was being unfairly ganged up on by those several centuries his senior, it’s unsurprising he started to flounder.” The adults’ stiffened slightly, Hades’s barb striking true."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades didn’t seem to care, though, just gave the impression of sticking his nose up in the air and turning away, like an imperious cat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Mentor Metis is asking for you,” Hades lied, “So, come on.” Prometheus had no choice but to follow Hades, though he could hear Pallas mutter something like, “I told you it was bullying-” before the ambient chatter swallowed up the rest of his words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You really know how to leap into the deep end, don’t you?” Hades said, giving him a wry look."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “They should’ve known better,” Hades said shortly, and he physically nudged Prometheus with his elbow, “Oh, stop moping."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Well,” Hades seemed a bit taken aback, “What did you expect joining a group of adults in a serious debate?” Hades sighed, “Ah, I was hoping to avoid doing some serious debating."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “In which case, let’s find an unoccupied bench,” Hades said, “We can  observe  from there without being trodden on.” What a crime,” Hades muttered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In this fic, Prometheus, Hades and Hythlodaeus are like, equivalent to 10 - 11 year olds, just, really smart by our standards 10 - 11 year olds."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was a power Hades hadn’t tapped into since that fateful day when the world split into fourteen shards, when he and Zodiark’s other disciples had fought Prometheus into a corner he couldn’t escape."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades floundering in the darkness, desperately scrambling for every  drop  of power he had - what power his God squeezed out of him, that poisonous voice that became comforting over the cold, lonely eternity since his world ended thundering in his skull to  ‘kill the enemy, kill Her servant,   kill your heart   ’  until his soul resonated with the desire  (command)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For blinded by his God’s screamed commands, blinded by his rage and grief, Hades did not realise that history was repeating until he descended upon that pathetic, vain reflection of his oldest enemy  (friend)  and  felt  his thinned soul  flare."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’s soul had a hole punched through it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades lifted his hands."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had not lived beyond the world’s Sundering."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I would have killed every single life on every single shard for you,  Hades thought, knowing that if it had not been Zodiark pushing him on, his own weak, sentimental heart would have pulled him on this path regardless."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades will forget."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’ll remember you,” the reflection said, and Hades didn’t know if it was a mercy or cruelty that he sounded exactly like Prometheus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades let those words follow him as he finally, after an eternity, let go."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the early hours of the morning, where the sun was barely touching the horizon and Amaurot was hushed and soft, Hades woke up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watched him from beneath his eyelashes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His friend looked so deceptively vulnerable when he slept, his soul a gentle, warm thing that purred when Hades brushed up against it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This was the  only  time Prometheus truly let down his guard, and Hades couldn’t help but reach out to tuck a wayward, dark lock of hair behind Prometheus’s ear, his thumb brushing over his cheek."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was in these quiet, private moments, where Hades realised the depths of his feelings for his closest friend."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had dismissed it as overly romantic at the time, but right now, in the quiet of the early dawn, he had to admit it was true."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watched, amused, as his friend grunted, then wrinkled his nose, eyebrows furrowed as he tried to turn away from the glare by pressing his face into his pillow, mumbling incoherently."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades moved his hand to idly card his fingers through Prometheus’s thick hair, occasionally massaging his scalp like he was a particularly spoilt cat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus’s aether fluttered, and Hades chuckled when the curtains sharply closed of their own volition, blocking out the light."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was half-tempted to just force the curtains open again, no doubt goading Prometheus into a childish battle of wills until they were both wide awake, but he felt too… something."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’m in a good mood,” Hades said simply."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Yeah, I feel it,” Prometheus purred, and he pressed closer - close enough that Hades lazily rolled onto his back, his friend sprawled atop of him, nuzzling into the crook of his neck like an overgrown housecat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His hair tickled the underside of his jaw, and Hades closed his eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’s hand stilled on Prometheus’s lower back, opened his eyes to see a thin ray of sunlight escaping through the curtains cutting a sharp, golden line across his ceiling."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “...I do too,” Hades said quietly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It took Hades a while to realise Prometheus had fallen back to sleep - right there, after saying ‘I love you’, he just dozed right off."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Hades just felt fond exasperation, twisting dark curls around his fingers as Prometheus weight pressed him down against the bed, a comforting, familiar weight that kept him awake, but also kept him happy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades wasn’t an early riser, got grumpier the lower the sun was when he woke, but  sometimes, rarely, he woke up before Prometheus and looked at him and  felt… Will continue to feel them, with the endless centuries to come, and once more Hades counted himself lucky, to find his other half so early in life, to enjoy being whole for the rest of eternity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades closed his eyes at that, drifting back to sleep himself, just as the sunbeam cutting across his ceiling faded with the coming of gentle, morning rain."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It had fallen to Prometheus and Hades to handle the management this century."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" (He had considered being offended… but then realised he essentially had a free holiday with Hades in  Xerora."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “This is the worst map I’ve ever seen,” Hades said flatly, eyeing the laminated paper Prometheus had laid out flat against the cafe table with open distaste, “Why is everything in neon colours?” Hades sighed, slouching deeper in his seat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Had he been by himself, he might’ve tried to match Xeroran fashion, but instead he tried to keep to Hades’s more conservative style of dress."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It meant they were wandering around in their Convocation robes, the more slimmed down, black uniform with the heavy hoods, and while it also meant wearing those very cool metal clawed gauntlets, it did mean he and Hades were stomping about in a  sunny  city in dark, depressing robes like a pair of killjoy ghouls."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Palace of Authority,” Hades repeated flatly, “Really.” Hades sighed again, and muttered under his breath, “I  hate  Xerora.” “I do wonder at Elidibus’s wisdom in choosing you for this,” Hades drawled, sounding reluctantly amused, “Should I worry about your crass mouth causing a diplomatic incident?” Hades looked doubtful, “You  want  to stay in this hellhole?” Hades looked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I want to throttle whoever the city planner was,” Hades finally said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked oddly pained at that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Are we here on business, or on holiday?” Hades asked dryly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades sighed and shook his head, but he was starting to smile, reluctantly amused."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “C’mon, Hades,” he crooned, letting his soul gently brush up against his friend’s, “I just want to spend some time with you.” “You  always  spend time with me,” Hades said, his lazy slouch shifting into more of a confident sprawl, poorly hiding his smirk behind his gloved fingers, “Needy little thing that you are.” “Well, I’ll be  needy  in a different way if you indulge me,” Prometheus said shamelessly, biting back a laugh when he  felt  Hades’s attention  focus  on him, a pleasant, prickling warmth tapping up his spine when Hades pressed firmly against his soul’s borders."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Really?” Hades said huskily, “Are you bribing me with  sex?” Hades gave him a long, heavy-lidded look, his eyes dark and his mouth curved into a little amused smile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “...let’s see how I feel, after we meet with the Xerorans,” Hades murmured, leaving Prometheus in suspense because  of course he did."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Next to him, Hades was just… taking this all in stride."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’s lips twitched, a spike of amusement fluttering through his soul before he tamped down on it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Er,” Prometheus glanced at Hades, “Yes?” “Our  agreement,” Hades cut in smoothly, “That we remain neutral to one another, and Xerora allows free movement of Amaurotine citizens within her borders.” “Get?” Hades repeated, starting to look puzzled, “Why would you ‘get’ anything?” “Well, our citizens will participate in your society, enriching it,” Hades said very slowly, “And-” “It looks amazing,” Prometheus said, ignoring Hades staring at him, “You’ve got a real talent for, uh...  dogs.” “Well,” Hades said, “You weren’t joking about being able to turn on the charm when needed.” Hades nodded slowly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That the first Emet-Selch created Xerora to simulate different governments?” Hades said, “Yes, I’ve heard of that one."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus eyed him, wondering if Hades knew more than he was letting on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus had things he knew that Hades would never, so it stood to reason that his hunch on Xerora  actually  being an old social experiment, long since abandoned, was true."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades gave him a look that said he was being stupidly naive, but Prometheus ignored it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades didn’t seem particularly taken with their lodgings either, “I think I’ve come to a decision regarding that offer of yours.” “Mm,” Hades lifted his arms up in a lazy, lazy,  lazy  stretch, his spine audibly popping as he actually straightened the damn thing for the first time in decades, “You mentioned a thermal bath…?” “I don’t  ache,” Hades grumbled, slouching heavily once more as he dropped his stretch, “But I am  exhausted  after walking through this city like a  pleb.” Hades gave him a look that could peel paint, “I’m very much  unaccustomed  to walking that far."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades gave him a heavy-lidded look, letting out a quiet, fond noise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades lifted his hand when he drew close, pressing it gently against Prometheus’s chest, applying the gentlest of pressures to make him pause just as they were nose-to-nose."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus made a low, impatient noise, his hands lightly brushing over Hades’s hips, and his friend smiled, clearly satisfied with the effect he was having."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Mhm,” Hades purred, leaning in a  fraction."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They were just shy of kissing, and Prometheus stayed perfectly  still, lips parted slightly as he felt Hades’s soul gently unfurl and open up for him, inviting him in."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was slow, so slow, Prometheus panting quietly when Hades pressed deeper and deeper into him, sinking into all the right  places, pulling and pressing as rhythmically as lapping waves, making him sway almost drunkenly on his feet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His fingers were curled tight into the thick fabric of Hades’s dark robes, his eyes fluttering closed as slowly,  torturously  slowly, Hades kissed the corner of his mouth and… Hades’s eyes were dark, pupils dilated, a very faint flush to his cheeks, but he was far more composed than Prometheus was, and he hated  (loved)  him for it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Bath first,” Hades hummed, because he was a fucking  tease, and had the absolute  gall to pat his cheek before swiftly extracting himself from Prometheus’s lax grip."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Wha...” Prometheus said stupidly, staring as Hades stepped out of arm’s reach and readjusted his rumpled robes, “Now?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I really do want that promised soak first,” Hades said, looking far too amused at Prometheus’s poorly hidden disappointment, “I’ll pamper you  later, you greedy child.” He supposed it was because he knew eventually Hades would give in, and it would be all the more satisfying and sweeter when he did."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So, he calmed himself down a little, ignoring the mischief in Hades’s expression, and played along."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If Hades wanted a bath first, then Prometheus would give him the best bath he ever  had."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He knew  exactly  how to display himself to get Hades riled up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades slowly stretched his arms high above his head as he leaned back in his seat, grunting when his spine loudly cracked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thankfully, after so many predecessors tweaking and adjusting Amaurot, Hades had little to do on that front as the current Emet-Selch, but he still had to do the occasional examination of it every few centuries or so, just to ensure it remained on course."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades nudged his front door open without a thought, shoving his papers back as he heaved himself out of his chair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hey, Hades,” Prometheus greeted, his amicable tone belying his uneasiness, “I’m surprised you’re still awake."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Is it?” Hades checked his internal clock, alarmed to find that, yes, he had been sat at that desk for almost twelve hours."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades eyed him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades patiently waited, feeling his friend’s soul flutter and twist anxiously."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades vaguely understood."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And, something went wrong?” Hades guessed, gently probing at Prometheus’s soul borders, checking for injury."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus’s soul shivered, but it didn’t shy away from Hades’s touch, “No… well, maybe.” Hades raised an eyebrow at him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades sighed, “Prometheus…” He was clearly distressed, the emotion becoming more defined the more he spoke, and Hades decided to set aside the lecture for now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Are you hurt?” Hades asked, gently brushing up against his soul again, checking  properly  this time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades leaned back on his heels, eyeing his friend."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was then that Hades realised that his friend looked absolutely  awful, paler than usual, his eyes red-rimmed with dark bags under them, like he’d been crying."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Which was  unacceptable, in Hades’s opinion."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You can stay,” Hades finally said, deciding to tread lightly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That was fine, Hades could be patient when he felt like it, “I was planning on going to bed, though, so if you want, you can join me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Not like that,” Hades muttered, “Get your mind out of the gutter.” Prometheus chuckled quietly, and a tension Hades hadn’t noticed seemed to ease out of his friend’s taut shoulders."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Still, Hades didn’t press."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was quiet and reserved, compared to the other times Prometheus would spontaneously visit him late at night, but Hades didn’t let it bother him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Soon enough, they slipped into his bed together, Hades not making a comment about clinginess when Prometheus immediately curled up against his side and gripped him tight around his waist, like if he didn’t hold hard enough Hades would vanish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Automatically, Hades rested a hand atop of his friend’s hair, absently stroking and digging his fingernails into his scalp, staring up at his ceiling beneath his eyelashes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “...Hades,” Prometheus murmured suddenly, his voice soft in the darkness of his bedroom, “Can I ask you a, um, hypothetical question?” Hades paused, gently curling a lock of dark hair around his finger."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Abruptly, Hades was wide awake with the disconcerting feeling like he’d just stepped into a live minefield and no clear way to escape it except to take a blind step forwards."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus was still curled up against him, his face hidden, his soul inscrutable - small, walled off, even to him, unnerved - and Hades was… uncertain."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades waited, but Prometheus didn’t continue."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Amaurot is our home,” Hades continued after a heavy silence, “I don’t… understand why you would want to run away from it.” “What,” Hades started, slightly alarmed, but his friend spoke over him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus’s soul was a prickly, buzzing ball of anxious energy, feeling like static electricity when Hades tried to calm it down."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Beneath it all, beneath that bright, battle fever glinting through Prometheus’s aether, the bristling of his soul, Hades could sense fear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “...Prometheus,” Hades said quietly, “What did you see in the Rift?” Hades gently nudged against his soul, letting the touch linger."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watched him, tried to imagine  genuinely  fighting Prometheus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Instead the spell had almost struck true, killing his physical body and dealing a glancing blow so severe to his soul Hades still felt a dull ache from the memory alone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades suspected Prometheus still hadn’t forgiven himself for the accident."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Well,” Hades said after a very long, tense pause, “I can say with absolute certainty I would never  willingly  fight you.” “It’d be too much effort,” Hades said honestly, reaching up to gently tug on Prometheus’s dark hair, curling the dark lock around his finger, “And I’d lose."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades soothed it, unfurled his soul for him, felt Prometheus settle into him - seeking comfort, reassurance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’m sorry,” Prometheus whispered, bowing his head until his forehead pressed against Hades’s collarbone, “I guess… it rattled me, seeing that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades hummed quietly, “It’s fine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His soul still prickled, it felt like Hades was stroking an agitated cat, its back still arched, fur fluffed, but slowly, slowly,  slowly , Prometheus began to relax, the turmoil in him easing until his unsteady, short breathing slowed into the gentle evenness of sleep."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades kept stroking his hair, though, as he thought about what just happened."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades trusted in Prometheus too much to even consider it ever happening."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus would be embarrassed, but Hades will be kind for once and not tease him for it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" (And he fell asleep, unknowing that the vision Prometheus had witnessed had been a struggle for survival in all encompassing darkness, Emet-Selch crazed and gripped by a monster of shadow, and Prometheus faded and weak, launching a spear of light through his friend’s soul."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This was the tensest Convocation meeting Hades had attended in  centuries."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades kept trying to catch his eye, even nudged his soul cautiously when this meeting started - but each time Prometheus ignored him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had only done what was  right."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades clenched his fingers over the edges of his arm rests, looking at Prometheus from the shadows of his hood."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades didn't dare try to reach out when he was like this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades's fingers twitched around his armrests.."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Within the walls of the Convocation Chamber, Hades’s and Prometheus’s relationship was secondary to their duties."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His soul was still a  wreck,  Hades noted worriedly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades asked, remembering that night where Prometheus, shaking amd blank with terrified shock, had whispered of 'something  inside  him'."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus hadn’t been very coherent at the time, kept mentioning something about a ‘scream’ and ‘it’ but… Hades had passed it off as him being in shock."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could feel his friend's agitation spike, see his gaze grow distant as his soul simply… locked up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" (Prometheus was staring through him, shaking violently as Hades struggled to keep his soul together, aether spilling out like water from a sponge, uncontrolled and fatal."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus's pain was beyond comprehension, so intense it felt  numbing,  yet Hades could only do this until Hythlodaeus got here-  \"...hurts…\" Prometheus was gasping, almost mindless with agony as Hades ruthlessly squeezed his broken soul together, \"...H-Hades, stop, s-stop, it hurts, it hurts-\") Hades clasped his hands together in his lap, fingers curled into the hem of his sleeve as he shifted his weight forward."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So, Hades stayed poised on the edge of the seat, ready to leap into action if necessary."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A  monstrous  noise suddenly screeched from the very earth, so overwhelming and intense it felt as if Hades's bones were going to shatter apart, an alien feeling of  something splitting his soul open and slithering inside- The illusion abruptly stopped, Hades coming back to himself clinging to the arms of his chair in a death grip, thrown far back in his seat as it would allow, chest heaving and soul curled up tight as that fading echo of violation slowly retreated."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His hands were still shaking, but only Hades noticed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had been prepared for talk of sacrifice - had honestly anticipated that some of the Convocation would be chosen for the honour of giving up their lives to ensure stability in Zodiark’s form and function, but,  millions?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Slowly, shakily, the Council members left until only Prometheus and Hades remained."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They need time to think, Hades said, flexing his fingers around his chair’s arms."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His friend didn't stir from his artless sprawl at Hades's approach, his head tipped far to the side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If you’re going to speak to me, Prometheus said when Hades stopped in front of him, \"Don’t argue with me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As am I, Hades said, waving his hand to create a simple chair directly opposite his friend."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades tried, cautiously testing the waters by very gently brushing his soul against Prometheus's."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Awful, Prometheus sighed, thankfully not flinching from Hades's touch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Carefully, Hades kept them closed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You feel awful, Hades said, trying for a mild tone only for it to fall flat, \"Should you even be out of bed?\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades felt the anger crack through their shallow bond, tried very hard not to snap back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades obligingly shut up, feeling Prometheus’s soul quiver against his."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus looked like he was barely keeping it together,  felt  ready to fall apart, emotions surging and twisting, conflicting, fast and irrationally enough that it was almost giving Hades emotional whiplash."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades leaned forwards slightly, feeling unnerved at how  unstable  Prometheus was feeling."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could practically taste it, an awful, ice-cold, paralysing emotion that crawled up his throat - Prometheus’s soul was practically screaming it at him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His friend was afraid,  terrified, practically mindless with it - and Hades had no idea how to fix it, what exactly was causing it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” Prometheus’s voice was a small, pitiful thing, and mixing with the fear was awful, gut-wrenching shame, “Can you help… please, make this stop for a while…” “I can try,” Hades said quietly, finally reaching out to carefully grasp Prometheus’s hand resting limply on his lap."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His friend didn’t flinch away from him, and Hades hesitated before slowly sinking into Prometheus’s soul, helping him compartmentalise that awful  fear  and  terror  into a tiny little box, to fester quietly out of sight for a little while."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus’s breathing evened out, and he squeezed Hades’s hand tight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was a thought Hades had been thinking for a while, but had been uncomfortable in acknowledging, but the evidence was right in front of him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus was shaken, horrifically traumatised, and Hades knew… he really was compromised."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “...can I talk to you now?” Hades asked with feigned lightness, as if nothing was wrong, “Or am I still banned from speaking?” “I think…” Hades started carefully, “You should rest for the next few days."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Just a few days,” Hades murmured, rubbing his thumb over his friend’s knuckles, his soul gently lapping against his."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This was the first time Hades had lied so blatantly to his friend’s face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was certain he would eventually accept the decision as the only option, anyways, eventually, even if he’d give him the cold shoulder for a while… But if it meant Prometheus survived (for his state meant he would not be involved in the summoning at all, and definitely not as an influencing sacrifice), then Hades would take it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Let me help you home,” Hades crooned, “I’ll give you a peaceful, dreamless sleep, if you’d let me.” He glanced at him with such intensity, that for a moment Hades was worried his friend saw through his lies - but then Prometheus just  sagged, exhaustion making his pale face drawn, as he said, “Okay.” “Good boy,” Hades murmured, carefully locking up the part of him that said this was a bad idea."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus was looking up at him, tiredly, his soul raw but trusting as he opened himself up, as Hades leaned down, kissed his forehead and murmured; “Repose.” It was also one of the very rare days off doled out to the Convocation members once a century (not an exaggeration), so of course Hades spent it sprawled out on his sofa, his window partially open to listen to the musical sound of rain, a half-finished Concept manuscript open on his lap."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, some were surprised to learn, quite enjoyed being idle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If Prometheus visited on those days, he would always mischievously shift the window by slow, careful inches just to watch Hades follow the sun rays across the floor until he ended up pressed against the wall."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades glanced from his Concept manuscript to where Prometheus was leaning against his sofa on the floor, fiddling with some overly complex Rubix cube."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades left him to it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus’s soul was lightly pressed against his, a gentle, pleasant heat that had Hades feeling drowsy, his eyes sliding over the words before him without really taking it in."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hey, Hades?” Prometheus said as his eyes slipped closed, “You going to sleep there?” “Uh uh,” Prometheus sounded amused, his soul fluttering with it, and Hades heard the soft tap of him setting his Rubix cube on the coffee table, “I can tell."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It being in the privacy of Hades’s home, there was no need to wear the communal robes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus always tended to wear as little as possible when the dress code was relaxed, while Hades was perfectly content with layers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The sofa shifted slightly, and Hades opened his eyes to see Prometheus leaning on the back of it, arms crossed and chin resting atop of them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He was giving Hades such a fond look he had to close his eyes before he felt embarrassed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That’s creepy,” Hades mumbled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Urk,” Hades coughed when Prometheus’s  considerable weight knocked the wind out of him, getting a very uncomfortable knee close to his groin and an elbow to the ribs before they sorted themselves out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades glowered at his friend now sprawled atop of him, who returned his glare with a smile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh, look, there  is  room for me,” Prometheus purred, kneading his knuckles against Hades’s chest like an overgrown, contented cat, “How about that.” “I will throw you out,” Hades threatened."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “No, you won’t,” Prometheus said smugly, and it made Hades want to  actually  throw him out - preferably  out the window, “You’re all bark, no bite, Hades~” Hades levelled a heavy-lidded, unimpressed stare at his friend."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His friend didn’t look concerned, even when Hades roughly pulled him close, close enough that their noses bumped together, foreheads touching, Prometheus’s lips parting expectantly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So, Hades bided his time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Still, Hades bided his time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades just had to kiss him in the right way, arch up against him, make  this  soft noise, and Prometheus was practically eating out of his hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades felt satisfaction."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades smiled lazily, leant back a bit more into the sofa, watched as Prometheus’s gaze darted down to his exposed throat as he tilted his head back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It’ll come, eventually,” Hades murmured, “Now, stop talking and kiss me again.” He didn’t immediately go for the throat, despite Hades making it a tempting target."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades basked in it like he’d bask in the sunlight during his naps."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus groaned, low and rough when Hades squeezed his hips between his thighs, effectively  trapping  him between them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was just focused on Prometheus’s hand, stroking at his stomach and teasingly circling his navel, ruthlessly exploiting a very little known  sensitive spot  that had Hades feeling uncomfortably hot around the collar."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It wasn’t  cute,” Hades grumbled, tensing when the faintest scrape of teeth had his toes curling, a warm shiver crawling right down his spine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Distantly, beyond the noise of rain, Hades heard thunder rumble overhead."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Just kiss?” Hades murmured, grunting when Prometheus’s started teasing his bottom lip between teeth, just enough pressure and  bite  to make him squirm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades knew he looked no better."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Just kiss,” Prometheus confirmed softly, his gaze lingering on Hades’s mouth before he shifted against him, settling in more of a lazy sprawl than seductively pinning him down, “I’m too lazy to have sex.” “Lazy, hm?” Hades didn’t comment on the hard press he could feel against his hip, idly curling a lock of dark hair around his finger as his gaze drifted to Prometheus’s throat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “No, this is fine,” Hades said, gently urging Prometheus to lean back in."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His friend did so, chin tilting up, and Hades brushed a feather-light kiss over Prometheus’s throat, felt the strong pulse against his lips, warm and fluttering, and-  bit down ."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The hot spike of arousal that shot through Prometheus’s soul almost made Hades dizzy, and he pulled away, feeling satisfied at the vivid bite mark he left on his friend’s neck."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He didn’t understand it, Prometheus’s little  thing  about Hades biting him like that, but he was more than happy to indulge, found some odd little satisfaction at the visible bite marks that Prometheus let heal naturally."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh…” Prometheus was panting when Hades leaned back against his pillows, his face a bright shade of red, “That felt nice.” “Masochist,” Hades murmured, “Was that hard enough?” Hades hummed, and his friend shifted, adjusting his position until his head rested against Hades’s chest instead, gently nuzzling against him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He was heavy, and Hades was feeling uncomfortably hot and riled up still, but Prometheus was right."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Maybe,” Hades said, idly stroking his friend’s hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades unthinkingly willed the window shut, easing back into a comfortable doze as Prometheus started to quietly snore."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades didn't partake in it much, being far too lazy to waste his time manually assembling something he could simply use magic for (and also he was terrible at it)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So, Hades barely reacted when Prometheus teleported directly into his house like the rude cretin that he was and set up shop in his kitchen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades shuffled over to act annoyed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Why, yes, make yourself at home,” Hades drawled as Prometheus summoned bags of ingredients from his personal inventory and dumped them on his kitchen counters, “I don’t mind.” “Oh, hi, Hades,” Prometheus said, rummaging about in the ingredient bag, “You going to join in for once?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades gave him a heavy-lidded stare."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yes, Hades drawled, \"I was busy sleeping, you see.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus set the eggs down, \"Oh, Hades, Hades, Hades…\" Hades snapped his fingers and the carton of eggs leapt off the counter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades-!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Annoyingly, he caught them, but Hades was entertained regardless."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh dear, Hades simpered mockingly as Prometheus protectively clutched the eggs to his chest, \"How clumsy of me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades simply smiled, leaning against his kitchen door frame as his friend turned away from him with his nose in the air."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, as usual, simply watched."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When it was Prometheus and Hythlodaeus, the air always buzzed with friendly affection and enjoyment, banter flowed thick and fast, and Hades would heckle them from the sidelines - until Prometheus would flick sauce or pieces of ingredients at him to shut him up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A lovely, comfortable kind of quiet, where Hades could lean against the door frame, close his eyes, and simply soak up his friend’s presence like the warm rays of sunshine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Wow, Hades, you really can sleep anywhere, huh?” Prometheus teased him when he sluggishly straightened up, “You were snoring, just so you know.” “Lies,” Hades muttered, his voice rough with sleep, “Are you done yet?” Behold!” Prometheus flourished dramatically at the results of his labour: a three-tiered chocolate cake, heavy on the cream just like Hades enjoyed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Cake?” Hades blinked in surprise - then frantically began rifling through his mental calender for what special occasion he had missed, “Ah, how unexpected…” No doubt he sensed Hades’s brief flare of panic, and was utterly  delighted  by it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Aw, you  forgot,” Prometheus crooned, boxing Hades against the kitchen door frame, “I’m hurt.” “Sadistically pleased, more like,” Hades grumbled, feeling his traitorous pulse jump when Prometheus leaned into his personal space."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Heh, ‘cuz it’s cute watching you fluster a little,” Prometheus admitted, pressing his fingertips against Hades’s chest, “It’s our  anniversary, you dork.” But he was smiling, and he drew a little shape on Hades’s chest before pulling completely away, “But that’s fine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh well, at least Hades would be getting cake out of it… “Fine,” Hades sighed, trying to sound put upon, but it was difficult when Prometheus felt like  that, bright and happy and everything he needed- Emet-Selch woke up when the tree he was in shook slightly, the pleasant, gold-hued memory-dream scattering into nothing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Reluctantly, and irritated, Emet-Selch leaned over and squinted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch wasn’t sure if this was a good or a bad thing yet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Good, because it meant he was cultivating a rapport with what will soon be Prometheus’s vessel, making his life so much easier when it came to coaxing him over to his side, and bad because it meant Emet-Selch underwent painful, emotional whiplash every time the Warrior of Light opened his mouth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch considered retorting, but realised he didn’t quite  hate himself that much yet to get into a petty argument with this pathetic shade of his old friend."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You know, this hot-cold approach you’re doing is giving me very mixed signals,” the idiot said, like  Emet-Selch  was being the unreasonable one here, “You’re all helpful and friendly one minute, then you act like this.” Go away,  Emet-Selch thought aggressively, his fingers curling into the sleeves of his coat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Curious despite himself, Emet-Selch cracked an eye open as the idiot set something down on the ground, between the roots of the tree."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The idiot looked up at him, and Emet-Selch looked away the moment he glimpsed familiar, golden eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch waited until the washed out, thin, faded impression of his old friend travelled too far for him to sense anymore before he got out of the tree."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Half-expecting something nasty to come leaping out at him, Emet-Selch opened it up and frowned at… it looked like a muffin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A chocolate muffin with a lot of cream just like… Hades had liked it… Emet-Selch thought of the memory-dream he had and felt oddly disquieted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Subconsciously, without knowing or understanding those things, but he remembered  just enough  for Emet-Selch to find himself faltering sometimes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s grip tightened around the box, and, hating himself, slipping it into his personal inventory, a flash of dark aether when the pocket dimension closed around it hungrily."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch returned to his napping spot after that, and after some thought, picked a different memory to indulge in."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was foolishly sentimental of him, to drift off into dreams of those halcyon days rather than deal with the dull drag of reality, but it was the only way for Emet-Selch to endure this torturous march of time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So, Emet-Selch went to sleep once more, as the Warrior of Darkness and the Scions blindly continued on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades refused to even entertain the idea of it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades and Prometheus had devolved into a screaming match that hadn't entirely been about Zodiark while the rest of the Council sat in very awkward attendance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By the end of it, Prometheus had almost gotten into a literal  fistfight  with Hades and had to be ejected from the chamber by Elidibus, who told him not to return until he had cooled off."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet, even Hades couldn't ignore it when Hythlodaeus approached him late at night, clearly worried when he said Prometheus was no longer answering even  his  calls and refused to let him inside his workshop and if Hades had heard anything…?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus never gave Hythlodaeus the cold shoulder, especially if he was fighting with Hades since he didn't… really have any other friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Hythlodaeus's worry was real and infectious and… and Hades missed his friend, so.."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So, perhaps against his better judgement, Hades went to investigate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades felt a shiver of unease at the sight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So, ensuring he had a barrier primed and ready to deflect hostile projectiles, Hades knocked on the front door."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Said walls were a mess of writing, scrawled in spiky, rushed ink, initially starting off as semi-coherent calculations on Lifestream connections and replications, but slowly descended into absolute  insanity,  Hades not even able to make heads or tails of what these calculations were even  for."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades's alarm began to edge into near-panic."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus had been a  wreck  and Hades just… Normally Hades would take that as a hint to leave him alone, but the state of his workshop and his earlier behaviour… Hades tugged the duvet straight before leaving the bedroom."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades muttered, trying to decode the calculations."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Some of them overlapped, or were crossed out and corrected in a cramped mess, and if Hades squinted and tilted his head far enough, he could sort of understand chunks of it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus, Hades returned, turning round."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With some concern, Hades realised that Prometheus's aether levels were so low he was practically invisible to aether sight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I was worried, Hades said carefully, giving his friend a once over, \"Have you been sleeping?\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades really shouldn't have left him alone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Really, Hades said, wondering if he could get Prometheus under another sleep spell before he skewered him with  armiger  in retaliation  ."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You see, I realised, either way, we’re all going to die from this,” Prometheus explained, oblivious or uncaring to Hades’s aether stirring into readiness, “Whether by sacrifice to Zodiark, or to the Doom itself, we’ll die."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had to take a moment to actually  process  that because he honestly couldn’t believe Prometheus was proposing what he was, “You’re  planning  on us all dying?” “Yeah,” Prometheus snapped his fingers, and Hades almost jumped with a staticy, faded illusion of their star sprung up between them, “But look-” “Prometheus,” Hades interrupted, beginning to feel alarmed, “I don’t think you should-” Hades went stiff, nervous despite himself at Prometheus’s wild-eyed expression, the way his aether suddenly crackled with violent intent."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades always knew Prometheus had an ugly temper when it was roused, but he never really feared being hurt by him when he was angry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Right now, however, Hades honestly had no idea what his friend was going to do, and he was uncomfortably aware that if Prometheus attacked him, he would draw a considerable amount of blood before Hades could subdue him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “The Doom is a combination is multiple things,” Prometheus continued, ignoring Hades’s concerned glances, “But the truly dangerous part is how it causes a domino effect amongst those with Creation magic."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Unless Zodiark is summoned,” Hades said, unable to stay quiet any longer, “We can rewrite the failing laws of this star, restore its vitality.” “...” Hades looked away, muttering; “One million.” “At least we’ll  live,” Hades snapped, “What you’re suggesting is that we accept our extinction without fighting back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That sense of unpredictability was back, Hades clenching his hands as his friend tilted his head at him, like a predator trying to decide whether to go for the belly or the throat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What are you  talking  about?” Hades demanded, wondering if his friend had well and truly  cracked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So, I’m going to  remake  us, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades struck, unleashing the sleep spell he had readied since the beginning of Prometheus’s crazed rantings."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His friend staggered, the spell sinking its claws in, Hades stepping forwards to catch him- Hades was very still, and Prometheus’s Sigil flared with ominous, red light."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What you’re proposing is madness,” Hades said with equal softness, his heart aching as he realised how  lost  Prometheus had become."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades must’ve failed to restore him perfectly, must have caused damage when clumsily forcing the two halves back together, and now a madness had taken root, a brokenness to Prometheus’s soul that couldn’t be healed unless his soul was shattered again to be remade back to what it once was."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Zodiark is a cup without a bottom, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades knew that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The idea of  dying, the idea that they would change and be different and- something in Hades rebelled against the thought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’re asking us to die, Prometheus,” Hades said, “What… how do you expect me to accept that?” “There’s no need to be scared, Hades,” Prometheus murmured almost gently, “We’ll die together and it’ll be painless."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I can’t,” Hades said, “I can’t die, Prometheus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades didn’t reply."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Without heeding Hades’s pleas, he slammed his door shut behind him, his soul abruptly cutting out of existence, walling off everything and anything."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades still caught that split-second of heartbreaking grief, though."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked at it, and knowing that Prometheus was linked to his soul weapons, spoke to it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades sighed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades didn’t want to leave him alone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Where Prometheus met Hades with hostility, he might be more receptive to Hythlodaeus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Damn it,” Hades muttered, pivoting on his heel and striding out of his friend’s workshop."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’ll get Hades and we’ll come straight there,”  Hythlodaeus said quickly,  “Please stay safe until then!” “Just about,” Hades’s voice muttered, sounding closer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I think he has aether poisoning,” Hades said, “Hmm, might need to make him throw up some more.” For him, he blinked, and suddenly he was naked in a bath with Hades rubbing a damp towel through his hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “-cerned that he had such an awful accident,” he was saying to Hades, “It’s very unusual.” “The Lifestream is unpredictable, even for Prometheus,” Hades replied, “He was just unlucky today."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades paused, but then continued rubbing his hair with the damp towel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I feared the worst when Hades fished you out of that Lifestream spring!” “One of your workshop rooms is now a permanent Lifestream spring,” Hades answered, “You were floating facedown in it by the time we managed to break in there.” Hades was speaking in that low, detached way of his that said he was upset, but was trying not to show he was upset."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “How’s  Lazarus?” Hades continued, when Prometheus stayed quiet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was already venting the excess aether, putting things to rights after being helped along by Hades and Hythlodaeus’s healing spells."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Good,” Hades muttered, giving his hair one last ruffle with the towel before pulling it away, “What an annoying mess, though."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades made a softly amused noise, “Can’t even sit up?” “Please don’t argue,” Hythlodaeus sighed when Hades opened his mouth to retort, “Come here, Prometheus, let me help you up…” His legs kept shaking when he stood up, and he ended up getting swaddled up in a thick towel by Hythlodaeus while Hades vanished the Lifestream tainted bathwater."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It didn’t help that he could see Hades over Hythlodaeus’s shoulder, smirking at him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hush, let me help you,” Hythlodaeus scolded, carrying him out of the bathroom with a very amused Hades trotting at his heels."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus grumbled, resting his chin on Hythlodaeus’s shoulder to glare better at Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades hummed quietly - it was him sitting on the bed - followed by his hand gently petting Prometheus’s still damp hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus will just whine about it later,” Hades said, curling a lock of dark hair around his finger and gently pulling, “Won’t you?” “Even though it’s  your  mess,” Hades tutted, but he didn’t sound annoyed, “Do you know what happened?” Hades felt dissatisfied with this explanation, but his knowledge on Lifestreams was basic at best, so took it at face value."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Sleep this off,” Hades said, “Hythlodaeus and I will clean up your mess.” It was going to be messy, backbreaking work to empty out the contaminated Lifestream and scrub it clean, and here Hythlodaeus and Hades were doing it without really hesitating."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades and Hythlodaeus, busy people that they were, had other duties to tend to, and Prometheus wasn’t in danger of  dying, so he could safely be left alone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was times like this, though, when Prometheus was keenly aware of how isolated he was when Hades and Hythlodaeus weren’t available."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was lonely… but Prometheus couldn’t imagine extending his very tight circle of friends beyond Hades and Hythlodaeus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He focused on it, recognising it as Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades politely knocked on his bedroom door before letting himself in."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Huh,” Hades said after a moment of silence, where they just kind of stared at each other for a bit, “You look terrible.” You’re not dying,” Hades sighed, looking amused as he approached."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hrrm…” Prometheus shivered when he felt Hades’s soul brush up against his, getting a taste of his aether, “I  don’t feel better.” “Because you’re bored,” Hades said, knowing him a bit too well, “You have nothing to do but brood over how terrible you feel.” Hades smiled, but his eyes were alight with a subtle kind of mischief that put Prometheus on guard."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hm, perhaps  entertain  is not the correct word, but…” Hades snapped his fingers, drawing forth a stack of papers from his personal inventory."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “-and you have been selected to audit the research proposals submitted this year for the Akadaemia’s budget,” Hades finished cheerily, “This pile has the cover letters for about, oh, fifty of them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Stop that,” Hades said, taking the pillow off him, “It’s not that terrible.” Hades made a… very interesting expression at that, like he was morbidly curious but didn’t want to actually know the answer to the question forming in his mind, “...sex pollen.” Hades returned the pillow to its previous place over Prometheus’s face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus just finished his rant into the pillow instead - Hades was barely pressing down on it, allowing him to breathe."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Almost tentatively, after a short moment of silence filled only by the sound of Prometheus’s muffled panting, Hades lifted the pillow and peered down at him, “Feeling better?” Hades dropped the pillow to the side and moved the stack of papers onto the bedside table."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To be honest, he thought the talk of plant tentacle penises would’ve had Hades make a quick excuse and leave him to his loud descent into madness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With all obstacles now out of the way, Hades snapped his fingers - his robe vanished off his body, leaving him in his loose undershirt and shorts instead - and rudely invaded his bed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Budge over,” Hades ordered, pushing Prometheus to the side, “I’m joining you.” After much pushing, elbowing, and Prometheus realising he was too weak to really put up a fight against Hades right now, they ended up lying side by side on the bed, nose to nose, Hades giving him a very thoughtful look."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’re in a very bad mood today,” Hades observed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Well, I almost  drowned  yesterday, and I spent all day alone in bed, bored out of my mind being all ill,” Prometheus muttered, closing his eyes when he felt Hades nudge against his soul."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of course, Hades knew all that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ah, I see,” Hades hummed, a slight lilt to his voice, “You’re feeling lonely.” Hades was feeling mischievous again, Prometheus could feel it thrumming through their shallow bond."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They couldn’t sink into each other any deeper than that, not unless Hades wanted to imbalance his own aether and get ill too, so Prometheus couldn’t quite glean his friend’s intent from exchanging thoughts - but he did know Hades was up to no good."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “How rude,” Hades hummed, not sounding offended in the slightest as he reached out to idly play with Prometheus’s hair, “I’m not up to anything."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “But our choices are limited, considering you’re bedridden for the moment,” Hades continued,  definitely  sounding sly now, and he curled a lock of Prometheus’s hair around his finger, giving it a firm tug, “Hmm, what activity can we do together in bed, I wonder…?” Prometheus felt his mood pick up slightly, greatly amused at Hades’s uncharacteristic transparency, “Oh, I don’t know."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades gave him a heavy-lidded stare for his feigned obliviousness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades kissed him, swallowing up his next words with a low, irritated noise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Combined with the purring sensations vibrating through their shallow soul-bond, the physical, sensual feel of Hades gently, gently,  gently  worrying his bottom lip had him trapped in a very pleasantly dazed state of  ‘ah this is very nice’."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It also made him feel uncomfortably hot, something he tried to ignore as Hades broke the kiss and started nosing along his jawline instead."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Every nerve seemed to buzz when Hades pushed him onto his back, pressing his weight on him enough to let all the air rush out of Prometheus’s lungs with a low groan."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He was helpless, his muscles weak as he curled his fingers into Hades’s shirt, and this should worry him, a little, that he was  helpless  but- He really trusted Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even like this, as weak as a kitten, dizzy and hot, he trusted Hades, and the fact he was vulnerable,  incredibly  vulnerable, just made this entire thing more  thrilling, more exciting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His heart felt ready to pound out of his ribcage for it, pulse jumping, skin flush with heat, as he tipped his head back, baring his throat, Hades pressing a kiss to the pulse-point, frantically fluttering… and  bit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ow  …” Prometheus groaned breathlessly, squirming when Hades just  worked  at the stinging bite."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Hades pulled back before it got too much, peering at him from beneath his eyelashes with such smug satisfaction that Prometheus had a brief, fleeting urge to bite  him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He  felt  the spike of arousal - quickly smothered - filtering from Hades’s side of their soul-bond, and started to grin a little, “Hades, you  pervert.” Hades affected innocence - it didn’t seem sincere at all, “I only have your best interests in mind, doing this.” “Yeah, right,” Prometheus scoffed, already anticipating Hades pulling some excuse out of his ass about encouraging the release of  endorphins  and other hormones to make him feel better."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Really,” Hades purred, pressing his fingertips against the bite mark he left."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus was briefly tempted to say he did want to do something else, if only to wipe off that smug look on Hades’s face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He was pretty sure that if he let Hades carry on, he might actually faint, or get close to it, and that was a pretty big mood killer in his opinion."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Mm, I don’t know,” he murmured, unconsciously tilting his jaw when Hades leaned in to kiss the corner of his mouth, “I feel kind of dizzy right now... ” “From…?” Hades asked quietly, his slightly cold hand splaying flat against his stomach."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’m hot,” Prometheus said, groaning quietly when Hades dug his nails into his skin, lightly scratching faint pink lines over his tensed abs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hmm…” Hades hooked his fingers into the waistband of his boxers, but he didn’t go beyond that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Instead, Prometheus felt him gently delve a little deeper into their soul-bond, just enough to make him gasp - the aether imbalance made him  embarrassingly  sensitive - and the sensation of Hades’s soul sinking and filling in all the right parts of him, was, for a moment, too much."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades quickly retreated, letting the bond return to being shallow and weak."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Too much?” Hades asked quietly, but he was already pulling back, his side of the bond tempering into something more controlled and steady."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “No, it… it was fine,” Prometheus said quickly, a little breathlessly, curling his fingers into the back of Hades’s shirt, in case he thought to pull away completely, “I just… I’m a little oversensitive but, I’m good.” Hades gave him a knowing look - he saw right through him, damn it - but he didn’t pull away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hm, I think I’ll wait,” Hades said, the corner of his mouth curled up into a pleased smile, his eyes dark and heavy-lidded."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You… you  rile  me up, and then decide to wait?” Prometheus grumbled, biting his bottom lip when Hades’s thumb rubbed over the jut of his hip bone, slightly pushing down the waistband of his boxers, “Hades, you’re a horrible tease and I hate you.” Hades’s smile turned into a smirk."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He really was hot, and restless, and Hades kept  touching him, lightly, innocently, but suggestive enough that it was making him  horny."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He supposed Hades picked up on that… Hades sighed in a very put upon manner, “Fine.” “You’re so romantic, Prometheus,” Hades deadpanned, his voice dry as dust, but he leaned in obediently, because despite being an asshole, he was also a  good boy, and Prometheus smiled as he curled his fingers into his hair, to hold him close, and kissed him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Honestly, Hades disliked them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" (Hades once asked him why he didn’t simply  Create  the plants he wanted, since they were old enough to start Conceptualising simple organisms like those, but Hythlodaeus said it wasn’t the same as gathering them naturally grown in the wild."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades deemed it a ‘Hythlodaeus Thing’ and left it at that) It made Hades exhausted just watching him, even though there was something endearing about it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus always ended up tiring himself out near the end of the field trip, though and Hades  always ended up being the one to piggyback him back home (if he grew up with a crooked back, he was blaming it on having to lug Prometheus’s heavy butt everywhere)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus immediately went for the cluster of blooming wildflowers near the edge of the clearing - drooping, bell-like flowers that were a beautiful shade of baby blue - while Prometheus turned to Hades and asked, “You want to climb that tree with me?” “No,” Hades said, because that sounded far too exhausting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Normally, this was when he called Hades ‘boring’ and wandered off to swing off a branch like a monkey, but instead he asked; “Okay, so, what do you want to do instead?” Hades eyed him, genuinely surprised."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades frowned, “I am not.” Hades was tempted to dig his heels in and refuse - but Prometheus had that stubborn glint in his eyes that said he was  not  going to give in until he roped Hades into  something."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Yes!” Prometheus cheered, and without warning grabbed Hades’s hand and started pulling him along, “Let’s go!” “Uuugh… ” Hades groaned, resigned to his fate as Prometheus charged onwards, almost wrenching his arm out of his socket from his enthusiasm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could hear the croak of frogs somewhere closeby, and idly watched as dragonflies hovered low above the water."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Does it matter?” Hades asked, crossing his arms and resting his cheek on them, his eyes closing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades hummed vaguely, still not seeing Prometheus’s point."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades doubted there was any  true  natural life left on this star, and it was better because of it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Also, it makes you wonder how  we  happened,” Prometheus continued, not deterred by Hades’s disinterest, “How did we evolve Creation magic?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Not really,” Hades mumbled into his arms, “We are what we are, and we know what our purpose is."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus let out a dissatisfied ‘hrmph’ noise, “You’re so boring, Hades…” “No, I just don’t worry about unimportant things,” Hades yawned, “Now shush, I’m trying to nap.” Prometheus went quiet, and Hades managed to drift off a little."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But… well, while it was an interesting mystery to dwell over, Hades very quickly lost interest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus suddenly elbowed him, whispering, “Hades, look, look!” “Ugh,” Hades reluctantly lifted his head, squinting at where his friend was excitedly pointing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You woke me up for that?” Hades grumbled, “It’s just a bird.” Hades tuned him out, lowering his head and dozing off again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades felt possessive over Prometheus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Now, Hades wasn’t the sort to throw stones in glass houses."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was very good at overhearing gossip, and the topic that insistently crept over the grapevine was how Icarus was so very  smitten  with Prometheus, and was trying his  very hardest  to charm his way into the Fourteenth Convocation member’s good graces - in  public  - despite Prometheus’s awkward attempts at diverting his affections elsewhere."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It  irritated  Hades, and it got to the point where he knew he had to  intervene."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’m not scowling,” Hades grumped, ignoring how the researchers already in the elevator instantly gave him a wide berth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “People are complaining about the racket you’re making down there,” Hades said, half-truthfully."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stomped on his toes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One bumpy elevator ride and another scandalous tale of Prometheus trapping Hades in a headlock for Elidibus to scold them about later, they met up with Icarus inside Prometheus’s personal worklab."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Good  mornin - ah, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What a… surprise...” Icarus’s greeting went from flirtatious to cautious in a heartbeat, the young man’s smile turning stiff at the sight of Hades sulking in Prometheus’s wake."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades immediately disliked him for this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Morning, Icarus,” Prometheus said easily, acting oblivious to the tense mood, “I hope you don’t mind Emet joining us today."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Icarus’s smile was definitely strained now, and Hades sensed a brief flash of nervousness in the young man’s soul as he glanced over at him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked back at him, the narrow slits of his mask hiding his heavy-lidded, disdainful stare."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Isn’t that right, Emet?” Prometheus said teasingly, gently bumping his hip against Hades’s."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades swayed lazily at the hip bump, slouching exaggeratedly, “No.” “Excuse me,  I’m  the brat?” Hades huffed, “You tried to suffocate me in a headlock not even five minutes ago.” “Um,” Icarus interrupted before Prometheus could launch himself at Hades, “Should I excuse myself, or…?” Prometheus shot Hades a glare that practically screamed ‘I’ll get you later’  before turning to Icarus with an insincere smile, “Oh, no, it’s fine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With that, Hades quietly melted into the background."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades spotted it immediately, the way Icarus’s entire posture and tone changed when speaking to Prometheus: flirty and intimate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But it was Prometheus’s subtle discomfort that Hades was focused on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades  wondered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It made Hades  wonder  if, perhaps, Icarus had an ulterior motive that wasn’t simply attraction."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It put Hades’s hackles up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades crossed his arms when Prometheus opened up a rift portal, shifting his focus from his friend to Icarus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades will have to intervene then."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Sorry, but I have other plans,” Prometheus said, glancing over where Hades was lurking in the corner, silently watching them both."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Clearly taking this as an invitation, Hades languidly prowled over to them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was going to get scoliosis if he continued slouching everywhere like that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Are you done?” Hades asked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I drifted off,” Hades said, waving his hand dismissively, “Utilising rift energy to cause spell transmutation isn’t exactly a new science.” With that, the young man gave Prometheus a shallow bow of farewell, Hades an uncertain look as he skittered around him, and swiftly left the lab."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Slowly, Prometheus pivoted to face Hades, who was looking at the door Icarus left through."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Not the whole time,” Hades said, clearly not apologetic about intimidating Icarus at all, “Sometimes I glared at you.” Hades’s soul felt prickly still, with occasional flashes of possessiveness darting through - he probably didn’t realise it himself, but Prometheus could read his friend like a book."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was  jealous , and it wasn’t a good look on him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades crossed his arms, straightening up a little."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That’s what has me suspicious about his intentions,” Hades said, “Why would he have a crush on  you?” “You’re not exactly popular, Prometheus,” Hades pointed out, a bit rudely in Prometheus’s opinion, “Majority of people have already made a negative decision about you before they even met you, and I doubt Icarus is deaf to what is said about you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That was oddly hurtful, coming from Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You’re saying no decent Amaurotine would  ever  find me attractive or desirable, and if they do it’s immediately  suspicious?” Prometheus snapped, “Well,  thanks, Hades, that’s so  nice  of you to point out to me!” Hades went still."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I don’t have an ulterior motive,” Hades said with forced calm, but he was slouching again, his soul shifting from its jealous prickling to something more chastised, “I like you for who you are.” “No, he just fawns over you like a sycophant instead,” Hades muttered venomously."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stared at him, utterly affronted, “What ?” Hades stood there for a moment, clearly debating whether or not he could get away with pushing his luck."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He was  painfully  aware that he wasn’t well-liked, and he didn’t need Hades bluntly pointing it out because he was jealous over some brat with a puppy crush on him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Luckily, Hades realised this  wasn’t  one of those arguments where he could charm his way back into Prometheus’s good books."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We’ll talk later,” Hades said, “When you’ve cooled off.” Hades huffed at him, but he left the lab without further comment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He understood that it was probably irritating for Hades to witness someone flirting with him, but Prometheus endured that almost  every day  when it came to Hades!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was surprisingly quite popular, despite his dour attitude, and had a ‘dignified’ position on the Convocation that involved a lot of contribution to the public."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This resulted in loads of people practically drowning Hades in compliments or attempted flirting, and Prometheus wasn’t going around being a spiteful brat about it!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That was because he trusted Hades not to go straying, and he’d like it if his friend offered him the same courtesy... Prometheus burned off some steam cleaning up his lab instead and, once he could clean no more and felt enough time had passed that he wouldn’t accidentally cross paths with Hades out in the corridors, left work."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus felt Prometheus’s upset before he opened the door to his home, so he was utterly unsurprised when his friend returned his greetings with, “Hades is a cold hearted bastard and I hate him.” Hythlodaeus felt he was missing plenty of context here, because that sounded mean even for Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Yes  !” Prometheus threw his arms up from where he was sprawled on his back, “Hades was  jealous  and followed me to work this morning to glare at the poor boy!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He could kind of understand Hades’s perspective, as callous as it was, but goodness he could have put it a lot more delicately."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades must’ve been very annoyed about Icarus to not pick his words with care… “Hades, I’m sure, was only concerned that Icarus was attempting that,” Hythlodaeus murmured, “Though, I’m sure he was also blinded by some of his jealousy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Did it really upset you that much?” Hythlodaeus asked softly, levitating a cup of tea to float neatly into his hands, “Hades saying no one likes you?” “Mhm,” Hythlodaeus smiled, “Hades, I know, likes you for the same reasons."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Otherwise you and Hades would continuously misunderstand each other and get into plenty more fights."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I was really hurt,” Prometheus muttered, “And I don’t like Hades being jealous and trying to interfere with my problems."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If Hades was as angry and spurned as he thought he was, he wouldn’t want to be disturbed for a good few hours."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In comparison to Prometheus who was surprisingly easy to soothe, Hades in a foul mood was a delicate task to handle even for Hythlodaeus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" While Prometheus loved being fussed over, and Hades the fussing, Hythlodaeus loved watching over and guiding them both."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Icarus Problem, Hades’s jealousy, Prometheus’s alarmingly low self-esteem… but they had centuries to work through these things, and no doubt they’d be old history when some new issue replaced them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus hoped that Hades and Prometheus’s relationship became less dramatised, though."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades supposed their first mistake had been assuming it would advance like a conventional enemy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It all started when Hades was in the Council Hall with the rest of the Convocation, overseeing the last few details of the summoning."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even with the safeguards, though, there was still a risk but… well, Hades would take the gamble."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The elevator stopped at the penultimate floor, and Hythlodaeus took barely two steps out of it before Hades accosted him, his soul a bright spark of frantic  panichopefearhopehope- !” Hades demanded."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not fear for himself, but fear for Prometheus, fear for  Hades, fear for… “You don’t…” Hades stared at him blankly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I barely managed to escape, Hades.” Hades squeezed his arms in a bruising grip, and something desperate edged his soul, the way it reached out, out, as if it could sense Prometheus nearby if it reached far enough."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “... no,” Hades murmured, letting him go abruptly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “He’s somewhere out there still, Hades,” Hythlodaeus said quietly, knowing it to be true."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The bond between them, him, Hades, Prometheus, it was strong enough that they would  know  if one of them perished."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “...” Hades said nothing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus knew Hades ached to leap into the burning streets below, to find Prometheus, even if it was to drag him back by his ear and yell at him for being a reckless fool."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But, Hades couldn’t."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To keep him under both his and Hades’s watchful eye while the city burned around them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Damn it,” Hades suddenly hissed, pivoting on his heel, pacing, prowling before the window, watching over the nightmarish scene of their home dying, “Why does he always make everything more complicated than it needs to be?!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” Hythlodaeus whispered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If he just  stayed with you!” Hades stopped, clenching his fingers in front of his face, like he wanted to grab at a mask that wasn’t there, “Now he’s  out there alone  while the whole city is burning down!” Hythlodaeus’s presence had only been tolerated if he didn’t nag him, so he had reluctantly let him continue on, but now… maybe he should’ve… maybe he should’ve charmed him asleep and taken him to the Healers, like Hades had suggested."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Prometheus is currently  mentally unstable and suicidal, ” Hades snarled, and those words were ugly, thrown out there with such frustration and fear, “For all we know he’s throwing himself at them hoping he dies!” “Hades,” Hythlodaeus gasped, “Don’t say something so horrible!” Hades looked like he was going to snap something back, but he didn’t."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And I won’t ask you to search for him out there either, Hythlodaeus,” Hades murmured, “You wouldn’t survive.” “...” Hades turned away from him, his shoulders drawn tight, “Zodiark will be summoned soon."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Yes,” Hades looked out the window again, and for a moment, it looked as if his resolve to abandon Prometheus for now wavered… but then he looked away and clenched his hands."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It’ll be fine,” Hades said stiltedly, “Everything will go fine.” Hades hummed at Prometheus’s observation, more focused on the blueprints before him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was for a new extension on the Administration building, and with the climate slowly warming as their star entered its hot cycle, Hades was incorporating a windcatcher in its design."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A system of ice-aspected wind crystals would suffice well enough as a method to keep the building cool, but working with elemental crystals was a pain and Hades was, first and foremost, an architect."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus, of course, had chosen his planning stage to be nosy, and had barged into his home to loiter in his study like a stray cat Hades made the mistake of feeding once."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Right now, his friend was leaning over his chair, his hands pressing uncomfortably heavy on Hades’s shoulders, forcing him to slouch forwards slightly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades didn’t have the energy to tell him to get off."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You know, it seems stupidly simple,” Prometheus continued, undeterred by Hades’s distraction, “But I wouldn’t have thought of it if you asked me to make a building that can cool itself.” “Knowing you, you would line the walls with ice crystals and call it a day,” Hades muttered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Except everyone has their own preference for temperature, so it would end up becoming a complicated mess,” Hades interrupted, “That’s not getting into how  unreliable  crystals can be, if not properly shielded from the aether the average Amaurotine exert."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh, that’s true,” Prometheus leaned back a little, easing some of his weight off Hades’s shoulders… only to squeeze them, kneading into the tense muscles, “Heh, I guess that’s why I’m not the Architect, huh?” “Mmmn… we’d be living in death traps if you were…” Hades mumbled, finding his focus wavering from the blueprints."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That is my speciality, death traps,” Prometheus said, pressing his thumbs on either side of Hades’s spine and rubbing small, firm circles there, easing up a particularly tight knot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades only  just managed to bite back an indecent noise,  “Which reminds me, I’ve taken up a new project today.” “Oh?” Hades purred, half-listening."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades basked in it, “It’s a new  private  project, that you might be interested in assisting me with.” Hades snorted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And how likely is that…?” Hades asked drowsily."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades paused, not sure if he heard correctly at first."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades barely knew what went into their construction, and that wasn’t getting into the fact that Prometheus was the only person to ever successfully construct one anyways."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “A portion of my soul, you mean,” Hades murmured."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “...yeah,” Prometheus shifted his weight, sliding his hand forwards over Hades’s shoulder to press his palm over his heart, “My plan is to craft an  armiger  using both our souls, to create a weapon the  both  of us can summon, so long as our hearts are in harmony.” “Then it’ll never get summoned, considering how much we squabble,” Hades joked, but the idea of it… he was tempted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades trusted him to create a fourteenth using his soul as fuel for it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hmm…” Hades pressed his hand over Prometheus’s, holding it over his heart, “Fine, you’ve gotten me interested."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus’s happiness almost blindsided him, it erupted so suddenly and so  purely , heavy with warm affection and love, that Hades almost shied away from it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Shouldn’t the name come  after  its conception?” Hades asked dryly, slouching slightly in his seat as Prometheus gently squeezed the tension away from his shoulders."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “A bit on the nose, aren’t they?” Hades murmured teasingly, “I’m partial to Persephone, myself.” Hades left his friend to it, closing his eyes as Prometheus talked to himself about the steps to  armiger  forging."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But, Hades would have to wait to see."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Whatever form the  armiger  made, Hades knew he would be content with it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet, as always, Hades didn’t dwell on it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I have love,” Prometheus reminded it gently, “I love Hythlodaeus, and Hades…” Prometheus woke up to a hand carefully shaking him awake, followed by the familiar, warm brush of Hades’s soul against his."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Prometheus,” Hades said quietly, “It’s been three hours.” “Oh, I dozed off…?” he mumbled groggily, blinking up at Hades leaning over him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hm,” Hades studied him for a moment, “You feel tired.” “I wish you’d have someone sit in here while you do it,” Hades muttered, “In case anything went wrong.” Hades hesitated, but after a moment he carefully knelt down beside him, adjusting his robes neatly around him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You know,” Hades said after a comfortable stretch of silence, “One of the newest children for this cycle has an affinity for the Lifestream.” Hades was watching him closely from the shadows of his mask, his gaze uncomfortably knowing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “In my company, at least,” Hades said wryly, “You know how people are."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus could practically  feel  Hades roll his eyes, “Me?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Though, I will admit, you  can  be very intimidating when angry,” Hades huffed, “But so is Hythlodaeus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I remember you had issues when growing up,” Hades said, gesturing to the room at large, “With all this.” “Instead of leaving them to the tender mercies of the MED,” Hades continued, his tone becoming careful, “I thought you might be interested in mentoring them yourself.” Between ensuring his continued contribution to Amaurot by developing new Combat-spells, sitting in on meetings, assisting his fellow Convocation members in their own projects, auditing research proposals, extracting Mako from the Lifestream, socialising with Hythlodaeus and Hades, etcetera, etcetera… there was no time to mentor on top of that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Only during their lessons here,” Hades said, “To give them an experienced perspective on all… this.” Hades wasn’t exactly a cold-hearted bastard, but he was rarely this considerate of absolute strangers either, even if they were one of the very precious few children of Amaurot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So, this meant Hades thought it would benefit Prometheus in someway, for him to push it like this… Hades went a little tense, as he always did whenever Prometheus called him out on his small acts of kindness, and leaned back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “... you’ve been in a strange mood recently,” Hades said, “Normally, introducing you to something new and unexpected breaks you out of it.” Well, if both the Lifestream  and  Hades had noticed it, then Prometheus must’ve been more obvious than he thought about this… dull feeling."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “...” Hades drummed his fingers on the edge of the spring, his soul feeling restless and frustrated, “They’ve been happening more often lately.” “Don’t apologise,” Hades huffed at him, “It’s something you  obviously  can’t help."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Insincerely, or mockingly,” Hades drawled, “Hythlodaeus normally has to wring a genuine apology out of you.” “I,” Hades said with exaggerated snootiness that made him sound eerily like Lahabrea, “am a  master  at saying sorry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Why, Prometheus, I’m hurt at your accusations,” Hades said flatly, not sounding hurt at all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was a stupid thing to find funny, but when he overcome his fit of giggles, Hades’s soul felt satisfied."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Better?” Hades asked him after he recovered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades nodded, casting a glance over the spring, “In that case, let’s go somewhere where we can sit on  chairs like civilised people, as opposed to this horrible floor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stood up with a bit more grace, “I’m guessing the MED is waiting to crystallise this?” “That’s why I was sent here: to crowbar you out,” Hades said dryly, “They’re impatiently waiting outside.” Hades looked at him, pointedly, before reaching out to grasp his hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He smiled, and when he left that extraction chamber on Hades’s heels, it was with a slight spring in his step."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even though Prometheus was isolated from rest of Amaurotine society, even though he had unpleasant rumours circulating him, even though he might be defective… it was easy to forget about all that when he stayed at Hades’s side, at Hythlodaeus’s side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “So,” Hythlodaeus began in a very innocent tone, “How has it been, working with Hades again?” Though, me and Hades have gotten good at passing notes without any of the others noticing, heh.” I remember Hades being so  despondent  when the Combat-spells department poached you four centuries ago.” Hades had sulked, Prometheus had sulked, and Hythlodaeus had sat there wondering how these two geniuses could be so  dense."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thinking on it, Prometheus had spent most of this week with Hades, rather than Hythlodaeus, “Oh, yeah, we have."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ah, but with you two, it’s a little different,” Hythlodaeus said, “Your relationship with Hades is a lot more… ah, how should I put it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’ll be blunt then,” Hythlodaeus said dryly, “Prometheus, have you and Hades confessed your feelings to each other yet?” If Hythlodaeus knew, did that mean  Hades  knew?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, who was always so close to him, who could read him better than himself most days..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Which meant, all this time, Hades had known and  didn’t say anything!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Listen here, Prometheus,” Hythlodaeus said sharply, his tone instinctively making Prometheus straighten up to attention, “Hades doesn’t hate you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades feels the same as you!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" While gruff and sarcastic with him, Hades never hesitated in offering him a helping hand, and kept him company, and fussed over him, and cheered him up when he was sad, and would indulge him when he wanted to talk about his projects, or even about birds, with this really soft, happy smile when he thought Prometheus wasn’t watching, and that they’d sometimes sleep in the same bed if they stayed over at each other’s homes, and Hades would wake up and play with his hair and- “Hades loves me,” Prometheus said, “And I love him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He couldn’t- it wasn’t for certain that Hades loved him back, and even if he did, wouldn’t it interfere with their duties in the Convocation?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was very devoted to his duties, so he might… refuse on those grounds, and it’ll get awkward, and… “I-I don’t want to mess it up…” Prometheus whispered into his palms, “What if Hades just wants to- to  stay friends?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I  do not  undress Hades with my eyes!” Prometheus squawked, his face turning absolutely  scarlet  at the (true) accusation, “I-I have  never- the audacity!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I w-wouldn’t do  anything  like that to- to Hades!” “Two weeks ago,” he said, “Hades met us for tea in his Convocation uniform, the black, form fitting one."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You stared at his buttocks for five minutes straight,” Hythlodaeus finished ruthlessly as Prometheus moaned in mortification, hiding his burning face in his hands again, “How Hades missed it, I have no idea."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ?” Prometheus groaned, “I can’t… I don’t want to lose Hades’s friendship!” He would just keep looking at Hades and wonder, if he would, if he would… “Alright,” Hythlodaeus murmured, “Dictate your honest feelings for me, and I’ll make sure they’ll reach Hades for you.” “Oh, um, maybe, uh, ‘hey, Hades, what’s up’-” Hades barely opened the door to his apartment when Hythlodaeus pushed a letter into his hands."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades didn’t even bother hiding his confusion, looking down at the envelope."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Had he broken something important and decided to pre-empt Hades’s annoyance by writing him some flowery apology letter?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Has he done something bad he feels the need to apologise for?” Hades asked warily, carefully tugging the envelope open."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Uh,” Hades shrank back a bit when Hythlodaeus fixed him with one of  those smiles  , the polite, gentle ones that somehow exuded pure  threat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Hythlodaeus was already walking away, leaving Hades utterly baffled and slightly terrified."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After Hythlodaeus had walked away with his love letter in hand, promising to hand it directly to Hades, Prometheus regretted everything instantly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It had been hours after Hythlodaeus had left, and still nothing from Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Or  maybe he had freaked him out so much that Hades was going to pretend nothing happened."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A flare of familiar aether knocked him out of his anxious spiral, and he jolted upright, frozen in a burst of panic when he recognised it as  Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Pretend you’re not here,  something gibbered in his brain, but that was stupid because Hades would know he was here and that he was ignoring him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" on his shorts before he mentally willed his workshop door to unlock and open for Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades would let you down easy, he wasn’t  that  cruel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades made a beeline for his private quarters, no doubt able to sense the absolute beacon of  intense anxiety  that was Prometheus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “H-Hi, Hades!” Prometheus chirped, his voice sounding strained even to him, “What a surprise!” “I got your letter,” Hades said, utterly  inscrutable  in both expression and tone, even though he wasn’t wearing his mask, holding up the letter he and Hythlodaeus had spent  hours  painstakingly writing and editing and writing  again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He was pretty sure it all showed on his face, judging by how Hades’s calm expression became slightly concerned."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Yes,” Hades said slowly, then, “Prometheus, are you even breathing?” “I’m breathing, I- no, uh, let me, let me say something first,” he said, when Hades moved to speak, “I know you’ve read that and I just wanted you to know, but I don’t expect anything and if you want to stay as friends it’s really fine and I understand and I’m really sorry for forcing my feelings on you-” “Prometheus,” Hades cut in, very gently, “Breathe.” Why would Hades look at him and think ‘ah, yes, I love that’."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hm,” Hades walked towards him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus didn’t look up when his friend stopped directly in front of him, determinedly staring at Hades’s knees instead."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Why did you write this letter and have Hythlodaeus send it to me, if you thought I was going to say no?” Hades asked, a strangely teasing lilt to his voice, “It’s not like you to give up so quickly.” Hades’s expression was still difficult to read, but there was something considering in his heavy-lidded gaze, like he had discovered an attractive quality he hadn’t noticed before in Prometheus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades tutted, lifting a hand to poke Prometheus in the centre of his chest, “Now  that  isn’t very brave, is it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Tell you…” Prometheus paused, realising something, “Hades, have you been  drinking?” “Yes,” Hades said, “But I’m sober."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades getting  drunk  was a rarity, which meant his letter had actually  driven him to drink."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Or… well, despite the slight scent of alcohol he could sense off his friend, Hades was extremely focused and sharp."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades hadn’t indicated one way or another if he accepted his feelings, was just demanding he told him straight to his face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Would it be like Hades to ask him that, then say no?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Probably… honestly, sometimes Hades did weird things Prometheus struggled to understand the logic behind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You…?” Hades prompted, pressing his palm flat against his chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could probably feel his heart going wild behind his sternum."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He couldn’t do it with Hades looking at him like  that, his face blazing with heat as he forced out in a great big rush, “  Iloveyoualotandwanttostaywithyouforever!” He was bracing himself, he realised, bracing himself for Hades to- to laugh, maybe, or turn him down, or tell him- “You’re an idiot,” Hades said fondly, and his hand moved from the centre of his chest to curl around the nape of his neck, the scuff of his boots as he moved closer, almost stepping on his toes, very close now, Hades’s soul unfurling, revealing what he had been hiding from him, warm, affection and- Prometheus kept his eyes closed, so it was a bit of a surprise when Hades kissed him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades huffed into the kiss before pulling back with a muttered, “You know, normally you  kiss back.” He could see the slight dusting of freckles over the bridge of Hades’s nose, and the amber flecks in his golden eyes, and found that his brain was just… fucking, doing nothing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades leaned back a bit more, for the first time a flitter of uncertainty crossing his expression."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Quickly, before Hades thought he had misstepped and made things awkward, he curled his hands into the front of his friend’s robes and pulled him back - maybe a bit more enthusiastically than he meant to, because they didn’t kiss so much as bump noses and knock foreheads together, but, hey, he got his intention across."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ow,” Hades grunted, before letting out a huffy kind of laugh, his lips briefly finding Prometheus’s in a fleeting kiss before he leaned back a fraction, “You get very clumsy when nervous, mm?” “Shut up,” Prometheus muttered, aware he was red-faced and mortified, but he tightened his grip on the front of Hades’s robes, refusing to let him move any further away, “You- that kiss was out of nowhere!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus found himself starting to smile, his nerves settling when he realised he hadn’t ruined anything, that Hades actually  returned  those feelings."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could be mean, but he wasn’t  cruel, and this wasn’t the type of trick he would play on him anyways."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Besides, Hades’s soul felt warm and brimming with affection against his, and Prometheus couldn’t help but reciprocate, shyly unfurling his soul for him, letting them entwine, just a little."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’s breathing audibly stuttered, a twist of foriegn warmth rippling through their shallow bond and making Prometheus’s toes curl."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Instead he pulled Hades back in, putting those concerns on the backburner for now, and murmured, “Okay, I’m ready."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Previously, he never had much of an interest in it, just the occasional passing, idle curiosity on how it would feel like to kiss Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Now, however, standing in his living room, Hades almost stepping on his toes with his boots, the feel of soft fabric beneath his fingers, warm lips against his own… well, now, he  really  had an interest in it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades nipped his bottom lip, scattering his thoughts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hrm,” Hades pulled back a fraction, while Prometheus stood there in a happy kind of daze, his nose gently bumping against his, “Now  that  was an interesting noise.” \"Shush,” Prometheus huffed, sliding his hands higher up Hades’s chest, until he could wrap his arm around his shoulders and keep him close - just in case he had any ideas to be a tease and move away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That’d be like Hades, “This is my first kiss, let me be all embarrassing.” Hades paused at that, a very odd feeling rippling through his soul."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “First kiss?” Hades sounded  something, and his hand not curled against the nape of his neck settled on his hip, his thumb hooking into the waistband of his shorts, pressing against the jut of his hip bone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades let him set a slow, exploratory pace - it was all very chaste, really, but… something."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was  something  that had his pulse hot and fast, echoed by the warmth of Hades’s soul entwined in his."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades nipped his bottom lip again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And now?” Hades murmured against his mouth, pulling at his hip."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’s hand shifted from his hip to dangerously low on the small of his back, fingers well underneath the waistband of his shorts, and Prometheus’s pulse  jumped."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He felt Hades smile, briefly, into the kiss before he pulled back a fraction, nose to nose."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus’s eyes fluttered open, aware he was probably making a stupid expression right now, face hot and eyes a little dazed as Hades looked at him like  that,  heavy-lidded and very very  very  pleased with himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Are you interested?” Hades purred, and with how his fingers drew little shapes just above his tailbone that was - it took  a lot of effort for Prometheus to remember what the hell he was talking about."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Hades just applied more pressure on the small of his back, keeping their hips snug."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Uh, Hades, I’m kind of…” he started awkwardly, only to pause when he noticed Hades’s smile was starting to take on a very  smug  edge to it, “Oh.” “I’m very aware,” Hades said with mock-innocence, and then the cheeky little bastard  grinded against him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The fabric of his shorts chafed a little, but Hades pressing down on his lower back, almost cupping his ass, as his hips rolled forwards and rubbed and- The physiological response to sexual stimulation was… it was a little much, but very pleasant and, especially when Hades leaned in, kissing the line of his jaw, up to his ear and, oh,  oh oh oh- Prometheus dug his fingers right into the meat of Hades’s shoulders, gasping out something incoherent even to his own ears, and Hades’s hand was  definitely  on his ass now, guiding his uneven, clumsy rolls of his hips into something harder, feeling the long, firm press of- oh, okay, so it wasn’t just  him  affected by this, okay, good, but- there was so much fabric in the way, shorts, robes, and Prometheus just wanted… more touch, physical contact… Making some vague calculations of where to displace their clothing, he snapped his fingers, giggling when Hades flinched at abruptly finding them both very naked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “The fabric was chafing,” he purred when Hades leaned back enough to give him a  look , managing a devious smile even though he was flushed and breathless."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I  was trying to keep things slow for you, like the considerate friend that I am,” Hades drawled, but he looked pleased, very pleased, and pressed against Prometheus’s ass, restarting the rhythm between their hips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Without the fabric in the way… Prometheus’s eyes fluttered shut, a soft, raw noise catching low in his throat, barely noticing Hades’s hand trailing with deceptive slowness from his ass, over his hip, down his happy trail to- He felt himself go tense - not from anything unpleasant, but just from the  feel  of Hades’s hand curling around his arousal, light pressure, a gentle squeeze and slow strokes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus gasped, pushing himself onto his toes, hips jerkily meeting the aggravatingly slow rhythm Hades was setting as he dug his fingers right into his friend’s shoulders, pink lines drawn from his nails… It had felt great when he masturbated, yes, but with Hades?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So different, his hand felt different, had callouses from where he held his pencil sketching blueprints, writing out his plans, rough palm, and he could be  kissed  while getting jerked off now too, which Prometheus discovered was his new favourite thing in the world, especially if it was Hades, kissing him slow, and long, and stealing the embarrassing little noises that kept slipping out of him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gasps, whines, moans, between short, strained breaths, echoed by the very quiet, barely stifled noises  Hades  made… Hades was practically holding him up at this point, Prometheus clinging tight to him as he frantically rutted into Hades’s palm, feeling his abdominals start to tense as that heat coiled tighter and tighter low in his belly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He was close, he was  embarrassingly  close, and he clawed a bit mindlessly at Hades’s shoulders, wanting closer, but already as close as he could be, nerves alight with pleasure and knowing his soul was just flinging all those hot and desperate emotions out there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades would feel them,  know  what effect he was having on him, and Prometheus wanted- he wanted him to- “Ha- ah-!” he couldn’t even get his name out- just, that raw, hot burst of  relief, hips mindlessly jerking in uneven thrusts as Hades, lovely, lovely Hades, gently stroked him through his orgasm - sticky, wet, his brain blankly noted - until Prometheus was whining from the touch, hypersensitive and squirming from it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Good boy,” Hades purred against his mouth, his soul pressing against his, hungry and hot and so very  satisfied."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It made Prometheus feel dizzy, in a good way, overwhelmed, because Hades kept  stroking, slow and firm, even though it made his toes curl and back arch because it toed the line of  too much  and  oh fuck please do not stop."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “ Nh, H-Hades, this is…” Prometheus gasped, barely managing to keep a straight thought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His knees were shaking, he wanted to lie down - he wanted Hades, two very strong desires that can be accomplished at once, “M’gonna, fall over, sofa…” Hades laughed, quietly, fondly, but he obeyed Prometheus’s jumbled up plea."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Despite being a lazy man who shirked manual labour whenever he could, Hades was still very strong, so it was with a thrilling ease that he picked Prometheus up by gripping under his thighs, hauling him up (and feeling the sticky, wet feeling of his own release on his thigh which was- well, Prometheus wondered if it was weird he found that arousing)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades!” Prometheus yelped, landing in an ungainly sprawl on the sofa, one leg hanging off, his hand just about grabbing the back of the sofa before he tumbled off unsexily."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Rude, I just helped you to the sofa like you asked,” Hades crooned, confidently moving to straddle his hips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The weight of him, combined with  everything else, pushed all the air out of Prometheus’s lungs, and then Hades was leaning down, his weight heavy, keeping him breathless, to nose along his jawline, lips brushing featherlight kisses along it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Didn’t have to drop me…” he grumbled with mock-irritation, curling his fingers into Hades’s dark hair and cradling him close as his mouth trailed down to his neck, over his throat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He tilted his head back, closing his eyes as he idly combed his fingers through his hair, his other hand pressing against Hades’s thigh, kneading into the firm muscle with his knuckles."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then Hades started stroking his stomach, trailing the space between speckles of drying white, finger slowly, lazily, circling his navel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It made him quiver, abs tensing, pulse picking up as Hades’s hand dipped  lower, thumbing the dark curls of his pubic hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus tightly clenched his fingers in Hades’s hair without thinking, drawing out a grunt from his friend."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Are you too sensitive?” Hades asked, his voice husky and muffled against the crook of his neck."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Very gently, Hades fingers brushed over his cock, making every single nerve in his body prickle, the sensation teetering between  sensitive  and  yes please."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “N-No,” Prometheus stuttered, groaning when Hades immediately curled his hand around his cock and started stroking."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades chuckled, clearly pleased with himself, “For someone who just had their ‘first kiss’, you’re eager.” “Shut up,” Prometheus muttered, helplessly bucking into Hades’s brisk touch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His friend was keeping him pinned down with his weight, so he couldn’t really  move, and he whined petulantly, wriggling under him as he dug his nails into Hades’s shoulder, scratching at the skin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades felt  smug, the asshole, but he lifted his head enough to placate him with a very distracting kiss."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades kissed him  hard  , hungrily, until Prometheus was a panting, lightheaded, dizzy mess, lips dampened and parted as Hades bit and  worried  his bottom lip until it started to  ache- “Hades,” Prometheus whined, not even caring how desperate he sounded at this point, clawing and scratching Hades’s back up when,  yet again  , as he felt his abs tense and arousal  pique… Hades eased off, his weight keeping him still as he gently,  torturously gently, rubbed the tip of his arousal, precum making it slick, until the warning cramps of orgasm passed, “You-  tease- I want- need…” “Hm?” Hades nipped at his tender bottom lip, “You need…?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus growled something out, wanting to shake him unconscious, and Hades just  laughed, his eyes dark with a sultry kind of mischief as he tightened his grip and  stroked- “Hh,” Prometheus squeezed his eyes shut, arching as much as he could, abs clenching as Hades found a  lovely  rhythm, stroking him firm, fast, rubbing gently at the tip, making Prometheus tip his head back and whimper as he felt himself about to- -and Hades eased off instantly, squeezing the base of his cock until the feeling passed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What do you want me to do?” Hades purred, clearly delighted at how  undone  Prometheus was, “Use your words.” Hades tutted, “Not those words.” Prometheus whined, digging his heels right into the sofa and restlessly moving his legs - as much as he could with Hades sitting on him anyways."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He wasn’t sure what Hades wanted, and his thoughts were scattered, too hot and frustrated to really puzzle it out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “There we go,” Hades hummed, a dark surge of satisfaction rippling through his soul, “Was that so hard?” Hades jerked him off, hard and fast, and Prometheus’s threat broke off into a mess of panting moans, twitching and squirming as the pleasure  piqued- and it fucking  piqued, the orgasm  so intense  Prometheus was fairly certain he blacked out for a good second there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He was just  aware, of, every nerve singing with a raw, primitive kind of overstimulation, his whole body shaking as Hades gently, almost tenderly, kissed him while he gasped and whimpered Hades’s name over and over."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “There you go, good boy,” Hades was purring, kissing the corner of his mouth, his jaw, as Prometheus slowly started to remember what breathing was, “See, wasn’t that worth it?” “Mmnnhh… ” Prometheus whined, twitching when Hades carelessly wiped his hand clean on his hip."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades huffed out a fondly amused noise, and he nosed at his jaw, almost as a nuzzle, but he let him catch his breath."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He still had his arms locked around Hades’s shoulders, fingers weakly pressed into the skin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus definitely wanted more of this, even if Hades was a  tease."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ...Hades also seemed to be holding back from orgasming himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades prized self-control, so probably didn’t want to risk losing it by indulging in physical pleasure when Prometheus was right here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” he murmured, idly stroking his friend’s hair, tilting his head to bump noses with him, “I want to touch you now.” “You are touching me now,” Hades said, but by the curve of his smile, he knew what Prometheus meant, “Going to deliver some payback, mm?” “I’m not mean like you,” Prometheus huffed, pushing against Hades’s shoulder to make him lean away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades paused, some unreadable emotion flicking across his expression, but he eventually did let them switch places."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades ended up lying down on the sofa, Prometheus seated on his thighs, and it was then he noticed what an absolute mess he was."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Streaks of drying white over his belly, and smears over his thighs where Hades wiped his hands clean, contrasting against his darkly tanned skin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He flushed a little, lifting a hand to wave it clean, when Hades made a small noise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “No, leave it,” Hades murmured."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was into that kind of stuff, huh?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Mhm,” Hades didn’t even bother trying to pretend he wasn’t shameless, idly stroking his dirty thighs, his thumbs pressing against the sensitive insides."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Naughty,” Prometheus purred, gently grabbing Hades’s hands and pulling them away, “I’m  touching  you, remember?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades sighed in the most put upon manner possible, making Prometheus roll his eyes, but he obediently rested his hands slightly above his head, giving him a ‘well, go on’ look."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Instead, he focused on his task at hand - Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He’s seen Hades naked before, of course."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet, right now, seeing Hades naked underneath him, watching him with dark, heavy-lidded eyes and his hips framed by Prometheus’s thighs speckled with dried cum… it was very different, very…  something."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His heart was beating fast, and he lowered his gaze, hands sliding down over Hades’s stomach."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He felt the abs tense then relax under his palms, and Prometheus couldn’t help but smile, idly drawing shapes, circling the navel like Hades did with him earlier."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He felt Hades shiver underneath him, but when Prometheus’s peeked, his friend’s lazy expression didn’t so much as twitch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Prometheus  felt  that shiver, so he did it again, very  lightly  stroking his fingers over Hades’s belly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He started to grin when Hades started to  wiggle  and made a  very amusing  expression and a quiet, choked off noise when Prometheus finally realised what he hit upon."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades…” Prometheus breathed, “Are you  ticklish?” “Right, that’s your five minutes up,” Hades said, quickly snatching at Prometheus’s hands and holding them hostage."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus burst into laughter, giggling as Hades huffed and scowled at him for ‘ruining the mood’."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had a  ticklish stomach  ."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “T-That’s so  adorable,” Prometheus gasped, working his hands free of Hades’s, “Aw, I kinda want to blow raspberries on your stomach now…” Hades sighed, dramatically flopping like a limp fish, his arm dangling over the edge of the sofa as he muttered, “Mood."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You enjoyed that,” Hades sulked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Mhm,” Prometheus slowly leaned down, chest to chest with Hades, and started nuzzling the crook of his neck."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus and Hades had always been very physical with their signs of affection, same with Hythlodaeus, except now it was edged with something else."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He loved Hades, he wanted Hades, he wanted to  possess  Hades… which was reciprocated in kind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Okay,” Prometheus murmured, kissing Hades’s throat - vulnerable throat - and leaned back, to kiss the corner of his mouth, his hands pressing against his chest, kneading his knuckles against firm muscle, and purred; “I’m in the mood now.” Hades hummed, playing hard to get, but Prometheus was a fast learner."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He was always eager to learn, and now that he knew Hades loved him  (was his), there was no point in hesitating or getting shy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" also a thing to note for admitting crushes... Hades, Hyth and Prom's ages are about 650~ years old, which for Amaurotines is the equivalent of early twenties, so they're 'young' from an Amaurotine's pov."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With how much Emet-Selch crawled out of the woodwork to loiter disdainfully in the rear of their group, like their mere existence exhausted him despite  actively seeking them out  (really, Emet-Selch was a master of mixed signals), Aza was surprised it took so long for the Echo to pounce and  show  him something of this supposed tragic past the Ascians had."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aza had started to figure out the pattern to it, after all: an event relevant to him, combined with a powerful surge of emotions attached to it… Emet-Selch had been pinging the flags for it for a while, and the long delay in the Echo vision had started to make Aza suspicious that the Ascian was just spouting pure shite to make him seem more sympathetic."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aza was doing the grim task of chasing off buzzards from the cart tracks in anticipation of using them in the hopefully near future, nimbly stepping on the planks when Emet-Selch literally popped out of nowhere and nearly startled him right off the tracks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh ho, that would have been an ignoble end to the Warrior of Darkness,” Emet-Selch leered when Aza  just  about avoided a very messy death via falling into the gaping, bottomless canyon below, “A clumsy  slip.” It was strange, but it was hard keeping his guard up around Emet-Selch sometimes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A moment of complacency was all it needed for Emet-Selch to pounce on the opportunity, as nearly proven just minutes ago."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What do you want?” Aza muttered, noting how discomforted Emet-Selch looked beneath the searing glare of the Light above."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Just came to see how you were dealing with the ‘cart problem’,” Emet-Selch drawled, waving a hand dismissively as he, impossibly, slouched even more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Y’shtola ?” Emet-Selch sighed, “Your memories so do resemble that of gnats.” Emet-Selch had saved Y’shtola’s life, something that made him both grateful - and deeply uneasy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What did Emet-Selch get out of it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch slanted a heavy-lidded look his way, his mouth curving into a smile that put Aza on edge."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Perhaps,” Emet-Selch purred, “With proper motivation.” “Hm,” Emet-Selch turned away from him, looking out over the dusty, rocky plains stretching away from the cart tracks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Indulge me for a moment,” Emet-Selch said, “I’m going to tell you a story.” Emet-Selch ignored him, “Back when the world was whole, there were many cities, larger and far grander than anything you broken reflections have ever conceived."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Okay,” Aza said, when Emet-Selch paused expectantly, “Sounds neat.” Emet-Selch fixed him with an unreadable look, his eyes shadowed beneath his hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But what did Emet-Selch expect?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Does it not sound familiar?” Emet-Selch prompted, his tone wheedling."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ugh,” Emet-Selch shot him a look filled with absolute disgust before turning away, “Ul’dah."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch sighed in an utterly put upon manner, turning back to him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Echo abruptly surged up, swallowing the painfully bright scenery and Emet-Selch to- Hades had something of a love-hate relationship with the place, because he despised the extreme heat and the headache inducing sun, but admired the perfect layout of this ancient city."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was older than Amaurot, old when their people first learned the magic of Creation, and Hades remembered studying its architectural science avidly when preparing for taking the title of- “Hades,” Prometheus sighed, “We’re in the most  beautiful  city on the continent, and you’re sitting here with your nose in a book.”  “It’s a very good book,” Hades said idly, but he did lower it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ?” Hades didn’t bother hiding a smile at Prometheus’s adorable sounds of absolute indignation, waiting him out for half a minute before closing his book and rising from his seat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Did you pass out on your feet?” Emet-Selch asked, and there was an odd tone there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Some things were clicking into horrible place, a nauseous realisation that oh, Emet-Selch had probably been telling the truth, and who’s memory that was… Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Was that Emet-Selch…?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Try not to be coy,” Emet-Selch sighed, “It’s obvious your Echo granted you a vision of some kind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aza wetted his dry lips, turning away abruptly, even if the hairs on the back of his neck rose at letting Emet-Selch leave his sight, “None of your business.” Emet-Selch sighed, like Aza was being an unreasonable child, “Really?” “Really,” Emet-Selch’s voice dropped, a low, predatory purr, “A ‘hotel room’?” “Did it seem familiar?” Emet-Selch asked pointedly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The view from the window didn’t seem familiar at all, yet the names Hades and Prometheus - just hearing them made him feel cold and feverish, like their very existence made his soul want to crawl out of his skin and into another dimension entirely to escape, “Not at all.” Emet-Selch’s stare felt like a physical burn on the side of his skull."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Prometheus,” Emet-Selch said abruptly, and without  thinking-  Aza turned to him as if he had spoken his name."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ah,” Emet-Selch’s eyes  lit up, “I see.” Aza froze, realising what had happened, but Emet-Selch didn’t push it beyond that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Well, how illuminating,” Emet-Selch hummed, his mood eerily cheerful as he gave Aza a quick once over, like he was looking at him in a new light, “Really, nothing familiar at all in that vision?” “Hm,” Emet-Selch smiled, and pivoted neatly on his heel, “Well, in time, maybe.” With  that  unsettling remark, Emet-Selch waved goodbye as he stepped off the tracks - and disappeared in a flare of darkness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Okay, Aza didn’t care if he had to craft a talos himself by hand, he was not dealing with Emet-Selch anymore."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He didn’t want to think about Emet-Selch in humanising terms."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" but to answer some questions I got... yes, Aza looks A LOT like Prometheus, something he definitely noted in that vision and got very weirded out by, esp when thinking why Emet-Selch was so interested in him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He didn’t care to get involved in  that  volatile situation between Prometheus and Hades, even if it was slightly inappropriate at times."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Why couldn’t Prometheus be more like Hades?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He just felt Prometheus would benefit from learning how to socialise properly, or letting some of Hades’s maturity rub off on him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" now that we know emet-selch's true name is Hades, I wonder what Lahabrea's was?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They glowed gently, swaying in the wind on tall stems that leaned over Hades’s prone form amongst them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades closed his eyes when he heard  (felt)  someone sit next to him, the rustle of grass and stems and flowers and fabric, his fingers twitching before digging into the earth underneath him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades…” his friend’s voice took on a chiding tone, “It’s been over ten thousand years, and you can’t even be bothered to say hello?” Hades’s throat burned, a pain so deep it was visceral."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades didn’t move."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “How…” Hades finally croaked out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We’re both dead now,” Hades could hear the smile in Prometheus’s voice, “You’re about several eons late, though."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades opened his eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His face was in slight shadow, but Hades recognised it all the same."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Unthinkingly, Hades raised his hand, fingers dirtied with dark soil."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus didn’t move away - wasn’t  repulsed  - and Hades’s shaking fingers touched his cheek, leaving streaks of black."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’s trembling hand was gently clasped by his friend, pressing his palm firmly against Prometheus’s cold cheek."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He could feel his terribly sad smile, could feel the slight dampness of shed tears, and the burning in Hades’s throat was intolerable."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Is it…” Hades whispered, “Is it over, Prometheus…?” Hades thought he would be frightened."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Death meant the end to everything,  forgetting  everything, the memories of those who came before and Prometheus being cast into the void, to never be recalled again, for Hades to  forget  them, and become someone, something else entirely."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Yes,” Hades said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Amongst that field of white flowers, with the broken soul of his friend leaning over him welcoming into death, Hades felt peace."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Except, ever since he had been under Emet-Selch’s tender care, something fundamental must’ve been damaged inside of him somewhere."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was right there, in his peripheral, but Prometheus didn’t dare meet his friend’s eyes, terrified of seeing how deeply Zodiark’s corruption went."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the corner of his eye, he could see Hades shift, his familiar yet unfamiliar soul rippling with poorly concealed concern."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No matter what, he was saving Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ever since the Doom wounded you, it’s been agreed that it left you crippled,” Elidibus explained, “Emet-Selch’s reports on your erratic, unhealthy behaviour further supported this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch will supervise your treatment, to ensure you are… comfortable.” “I see,” Prometheus said, wondering if it was Emet-Selch who convinced them of this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Zodiark was probably dancing a jig right now at the thought of Prometheus slinking back willingly into His hands, and was dangling Emet-Selch in front of him as a carrot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even when Prometheus had been, admittedly, out of mind with fear and pain when the Doom drew close, Elidibus had tried to keep him calm and mediate his aggressive arguments with Hades right until the end."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No one denied what Elidibus said, not even Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Prometheus,” Hades said quietly, and he went rigid, forcibly turning his head in the opposite direction of his voice, “It’s not an insult.” Hades sounded the same,  felt  the same,  that  was the insult."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’s concern and yearning was clear to him, even with his soul’s barriers up, and it- it  pissed him off so much."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I understand that it must be frightening for you,” Elidibus murmured, and in his peripheral Prometheus saw him shoot Hades a warning look, “But know that our God holds no grudge against you for denying Him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “He has far more self-control than that,” Hades said peevishly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, quicker: “Prometheus!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Prometheus, stay calm,” Hades said gently, soothingly, knowing better than to test  Valstrax’s  barrier - he helped him make it, so many centuries ago."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stood beyond  Valstrax’s  barrier, his mask in place, but his concern and worry was so  vivid, so much like… how it was before, so much like… It had been three days since Prometheus had fled in a wild panic from them and Hades was sick with worry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’s stomach knotted as he remembered that discomforting pull from  Valstax."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Damn it,” Hades muttered, stopping in front of his apartment window."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He no longer goaded him, just because he found Hades’s annoyed expression cute, or rambled to him about birds, or this or that odd Concept he was thinking of making, or..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He had refused to even look at him, and when Hades tried-  tried  - to reach out, gently, carefully, with his soul, to reassure him that it was okay, Hades was still on his side, he wasn’t mad - Prometheus had  snapped  at him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had  felt  the ugly surge of betrayal and anger and despair from Prometheus as he lashed out at his soul’s touch, and Hades had given him space, bewildered and wounded."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was his illness, Hades told himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He probably thought Hades had been reaching out to hurt him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades won’t give up on him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As hurtful and frustrating as Prometheus was being, Hades will endure it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He felt Zodiark might’ve spooked him by accident, reaching out too heavy-handedly, yes, no, Hades will ensure Prometheus was sufficiently calm before accepting His wisdom."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades will drag him before Zodiark, kicking and screaming if he had to, and pin him down if he must, to make sure the Blessing  sticks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus’s place was always meant to be at Hades’s side - they were one soul in two bodies, and his heart  ached  at this distance between them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades  will have his other half back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades tuned the order out, already mentally supplanting whatever nonsense coming out of the customer’s mouth with ‘decaff espresso’ as his gaze slid over to the far corner of the coffee shop."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was the sole bright spot in Hades’s day, honestly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It wasn’t that he was  worried, of course not, but Hades was edging from ‘exhausted apathy’ into ‘vaguely homicidal’ without that comforting distraction and he still had four hours left of this shift."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “-did you get all that?” demanded the customer, a very haughty Lalafell that Hades had an urge to tip off the stool they were using to see over the counter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’s reluctantly looked away from the empty corner, hitched up a smile as equally vacant, and lied, “Of course.” “Emet,” Lahabrea said, sulking in a too-large hoodie like some scruffy hoodlum, “Espresso.” “I thought I smelled sulphur,” Hades commented idly, taking in his appearance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades made an espresso."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “So,” Hades began idly, “How’s that dissertation coming along?” “That bad, huh?” Hades tutted in mock-sympathy, setting the drink down and shoving it over into Lahabrea’s open, grasping hand, “Oh!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lahabrea froze, and Hades didn’t bother hiding his grin at the look of blank despair that crossed his pale face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It starts in two hours,” Hades added."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades hummed, watching the poor man shuffle off with his shoulders slumped, like he was carrying the weight of the world on them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He was passionate about his work, but Hades worried he was going to self-destruct one day."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If he did, then Hades would end up having to take longer shifts to cover him, which would be terrible."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades eyed the empty corner again, and fought the urge to sigh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was ticking close to nine o’clock - the end of Hades’s shift - when Prometheus  finally  slinked in."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades very quickly kicked Lahabrea off the till - who had allowed it with a disgusted mutter of  ‘just ask for his number already’  - and ensured to look as apathetic as possible as his ray of sunshine approached the counter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Mmn, evenin’,” Prometheus said, giving him a tired but sincere smile, “You’re still here, Emet?” “I never leave,” Hades said flatly, “Medium mocha?” Hades shot Lahabrea a look, and his coworker dutifully started making the drink with a roll of his eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “This is late for you,” Hades said with forced idleness, accepting Prometheus’s gil without bothering to count it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He seemed a bit nervous about something, and Hades couldn’t help but frown."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades tilted his head, puzzled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “This is agony to witness,” Lahabrea cut in, leaning past Hades to shove Prometheus’s mocha across the counter, “He’s asking if you want to go home with him after your shift, Emet.” Hades blinked, the same time Prometheus looked mortified enough to expire on the spot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Wait,” Hades started, “Are you asking me on a-” For a long moment, Hades and Lahabrea stared after him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “...” Hades looked down at the abandoned drink."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lahabrea had scrawled Hades’s number on the side, “Huh.” Unfortunately, he came back during Hades’s off day."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Fortunately,  Lahabrea gave him Hades’s number and told him to please sort this out so he wasn’t forced to witness their relationship drama every time they were in the shop together."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I thought of Ascians having their own coffee shop called Amaurot, and across the street the Scions have their own coffee shop called Seventh Dawn, and there's this big dumb rivalry and Hades gets to flex his petty bitchiness in it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He was being difficult this morning - Hades and Hythlodaeus had obediently donned their communal robes and masks, and were loitering in the front garden as Prometheus dug his heels in and refused to put his mask on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" (Hades and Hythlodaeus, she refused to obtain that level of ignorance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “He finds them scary,” Hades piped up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus shot his agemate a look of utter betrayal, “Hades!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades shifted his weight, a brief sign of his discomfort, but he didn’t apologise, “It’s something you need to get over.”  Metis mulled over that as Prometheus and Hades slipped into one of their regular squabbles, Hythlodaeus anxiously refereeing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He opened his soul up to her, Hades and Hythlodaeus, and that was all he needed for now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Thank you for telling me, Hades,” Metis said, because while she didn’t condone breaking promises, she did accept it if it was done to help someone, “Now, Prometheus, I understand why you don’t want to wear the mask.” She ushered them out from their garden, smiling when Hythlodaeus and Hades immediately bracketed Prometheus between them, and drew him into a conversation about what was better, a hawk or a falcon?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Metis could practically  feel  the regret radiating off Hades for asking that question, but he indulged Prometheus all the same."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He had thought, in that moment, where Aza had been delirious and in agony, before Emet-Selch ruined the plan, that he had only imagined him gasping his name but… Of course, the emotional ‘reunion’ had to be cut short on account of still being in Emet-Selch’s apocalyptic illusion."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch had been right to express disbelief at his ability to walk, because without being prompt up by sheer willpower, adrenaline and determination, Exarch’s legs decided they no longer knew how to work."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch had pushed him to the limits of his defiance, trying to tease out and then  claw out  his knowledge on winding back time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" On either side of him, his agemates Hythlodaeus and Hades were sprawled out in equal states of bliss."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades liked very squashy pillows, while Hythlodaeus liked firm ones, and Prometheus somewhere in between, but after a lot of squabbling, compromising and clever thinking, they all had their own little ‘section’ in the pillow fort to their own specifications and were rewarding themselves with a good lazing about."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus lifted his head enough to rest his chin on his pillow, sleepily looking to his left where Hades was."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Geeze, Hades sure fell asleep fast, huh?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades grunted when that odd phrase filtered through his half-awake mind, and he squinted past his duvet cocoon to see Prometheus and Hythlodaeus in very animated conversation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What,” Hades groaned, “Are you two  arguing about?”  “Infinite regress,” Hythlodaeus answered promptly, while Prometheus continued to look offended about the turtles, “Are you done napping, Hades?”  “Mngh,” was Hades’s answer to that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Aw, baby Hades is still drowsy,” Prometheus teased, looking away from the elephant model to pin Hades down with a mischievous grin, “Do you need help getting up?”  Hades narrowed his eyes into a thin glare, “Don’t.”  Hades squawked angrily, managing to flail his limbs free of his duvet just in time to counterattack Prometheus’s unprovoked  assault."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In no time at all, they were grappling and wrestling childishly with each other, Hades yelling furiously and Prometheus cackling, while Hythlodaeus simply opened his book and ignored them with a quiet sigh, the elephant model and its offensive infinite turtles forgotten."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Prom-  argh,”  Hades grunted when Prometheus managed to grab him in a headlock and promptly shoved all his weight on top of him, pinning Hades facedown against the pillows, “G-Get off!” He was  freakishly strong,  in Hades’s irritated opinion, and once he had him pinned like this, there was no escape."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stopped struggling with a sulky mutter, wishing he just went back to sleep."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You  win  , you  idiot  !” Hades snapped, kicking his legs uselessly, “Now, get off!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Hades sat up, smoothing down his hair that got messed up in the tussle, he shot a glower at his friend."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prom was sprawled out, flushed and grinning, clearly happy, and Hades found most of his annoyance spluttering out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He idly kicked his legs up into the air, “You sure you don’t have narcolepsy, Hades?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Puppy  what?”  Hades asked blankly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades and Hythlodaeus shared a look."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was normally harmless stuff, and honestly, Hades thought it sounded nice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Alright, fine, fine…” Hades muttered, grabbing one of his pillows and shifting it closer to Prometheus, before flopping next to him, resting his head on Prometheus’s shoulder, “Just don’t go squashing me in your sleep.” Hythlodaeus’s and Prometheus’s souls were warm and fuzzy, and Hades soaked it up like a cat basking in sunlight, already drowsing off."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I, um, I like Mentor Metis, and… I like Hades and Hythlodaeus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Except… Hades is very lazy and grumbles all the time, and acts like he’s too good for everything, but, he’s nice to me mostly, but, in a sneaky trying not to be kind of way, if that makes sense?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He’s calm, but not in the lazy way like Hades is.” Hythlodaeus’s gentleness to balance out Hades’s harshness, while Prometheus was the energetic one to keep them focused."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And, I’ll share it with Hades and Hythlodaeus too, when I go back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I have to bring Hades and Hythlodaeus next time,” Prometheus mumbled to themselves, under their breath, “They’d love this…”  “Next time,” Prometheus said as they took his hand, skipping as they moved on, “Can I bring Hades and Hythlodaeus?” We need to return home before Hades and Hythlodaeus get it in their heads to mount a ‘rescue party’ for you.”  Hades couldn’t help but glance over every so often at where Prometheus was slouched over in his seat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was their weekly Convocation meeting, and while Hades and Prometheus maintained professionalism within these walls and didn’t overtly demonstrate their close relationship, Prometheus at least greeted him or sent him a cheeky note or two when Elidibus’s gaze was turned elsewhere."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It wasn’t a cold shoulder - Hades knew when Prometheus was angry at him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That could mean anything, and not necessarily bad either, but still… Hades couldn’t help but worry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades winced at that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades made a beeline for Prometheus the moment it was polite to rise out of his chair, trying to seem nonchalant despite his hurried steps."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’re distracted this morning,” Hades said the moment he reached his friend, scrutinising him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus was moving stiffly, rising from his seat with a careful precision that Hades found suspicious."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His mask hid his expression, and when Hades prodded his soul’s borders, he was, unusually, kept out, “Probably because I stayed up late last night."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Mn,” Hades tilted his head, “Research?”  Hades hummed doubtfully, but let the subject drop."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Well,” Hades began a mite slyly, “Now that you mention it, I  do  need some help with the Bureau’s Concept submissions."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades gave him a heavy-lidded look, amused, “Oh?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He lacked a devious bone in his body, so Hades was greatly entertained at watching his friend flounder about, his gaze casting about for inspiration for his excuse."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Yes?” Hades prompted mildly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades raised an eyebrow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “...” Hades put as much Doubt as he could into that silence before heaving a sigh, “Fine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Incredibly rude since this room had a door for a reason, but everyone else had filtered out by that point, so Hades let it slide."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With that, Hades cast the matter entirely out of his mind without a thought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus’s workshop always buzzed with a frenetic energy, a side-effect of his experiments and powerful Concepts, and if he went to Hades’s they’d either argue or get, er,  distracted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" An easy bit of molecular manipulation - and something Hades grouched about ‘ruining the taste of tea’, which was just silly, “You let your tea go cold.”  “I think you should take a nap now,” Hythlodaeus sighed, “If Hades sees you looking like that, he will  fuss.” Hades was an odd duck, in that he tried to come across as aloof while caring intensely about his friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Luckily, the pair of them saw through his act, especially when Hades decided to get  fussy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No man could motherhen like Hades when the mood struck him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ah, that’d be a terrible fate indeed,” Prometheus drawled, “To have the esteemed Emet-Selch wait on me, hand and foot, out of concern for my health.” Prometheus had been dreadfully ill, but stubborn about it, and Hades had resorted to Extreme Measures."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Honestly, Hythlodaeus was tempted to snitch on him to Hades, if only because he was good at wrangling Prometheus into taking better care of himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He recalled, distantly, Hades expressing uneasiness about  Lazarus  when Prometheus created it several centuries ago."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus had always dismissed Hades’s concerns, though…  “I still say you should inform the Convocation,” Hythlodaeus said firmly, and, when Prometheus opened his mouth to protest, he added, “Otherwise, I will tell Hades what you just told me -  exactly  .” He might help Prometheus procrastinate or goof off sometimes, especially if it wound Hades up, but when his friend’s health was on the line, he was stern."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The moment Hades sees you without your mask, he’ll know something’s wrong.” It was close to late afternoon by the time Hades could free himself long enough to visit Hythlodaeus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “He was very tired,” Hythlodaeus explained when Hades asked, “He’s been like this for about six hours now.”  “He must’ve needed it,” Hades said neutrally, internally kicking himself for not noticing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Mm,” Hythlodaeus made a vague noise, “Stop hovering over him, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’m not  hovering,”  Hades grumbled, but he did stop leaning over Prometheus to take a seat next to Hythlodaeus instead."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “He looks awful,” Hades commented, taking in the dark bruises under Prometheus’s eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hrm,” Hades felt a prickle of annoyance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Why did Prometheus tell Hythlodaeus his woes but brushed Hades’s concern off?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades frowned, giving his smirking friend a wary look, “What?”  “If he’s struggling to sleep…” Hythlodaeus started with faux innocence, “All I’m saying is everyone knows that only the esteemed Emet-Selch can match the Fourteenth in terms of stamina and skill, so exhausting him to the point of sleep should be-”   “Stop,”  Hades hissed, smacking his friend on the shoulder."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stood up, ignoring how hot his face felt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus always gushed how romantic it was, much to Hades’s… not discomfort but… it always left him feeling hot about the collar to have it brought up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I have work to do,” Hades grumped, “Tell Prometheus I’ll visit him later this evening when he wakes up.”  Hythlodaeus sighed, but he didn’t argue, just sipping his tea while giving Hades a knowing look, “Alright."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Goodbye, Hades.”  Hades muttered his farewells and left, feeling… annoyed, worried, and put off."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades needed to get a grip on that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades can deal with the shrubbery.\r\n\tIt isn't  weird,\"  Hades huffed, bristling at the perceived slight, \"It's  skill."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He laughed quietly when Hades slanted a narrow-eyed stare in Prometheus's direction, a crackle of tension forming between them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades asked with mock-sweetness, an aura of danger radiating from him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As amusing as this is, Hythlodaeus cut in before Hades gave into his clear impulse to grab Prometheus into a punishing headlock, \"I do want this garden completed today…\"  \"Right,\" Prometheus said blithely, like he wasn’t the instigator of that distraction, \"Like I was saying, Hades can show off his  precise touch  for flowers and-\"  \"Skill,\" Hades gritted out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Supervise, Hades said, his annoyed expression easing into something smug, \"If I have a skill for coaxing things to grow, you have a skill for making them wither."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You promised to never speak of that,  Prometheus hissed, thrusting a finger at Hades’s nose, \"That only happened  once,  anyways, and when we were practically kids!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And then, Hades did The Thing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Pleased at having turned Prometheus's teasing upon himself and gotten under his skin, Hades slanted a heavy-lidded stare at the fuming Fourtheenth’s way, mouth curved into a smirk as he said, \"Oh, yeah?\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Uh, yes?” Hythlodaeus blurted, startled at being so abruptly addressed - but Prometheus wasn’t listening anyways, as he was now barking conditions and rules as a deeply amused Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As much as he and Prometheus loved winding Hades up and making him agitated, the same could be said vice versa."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades very much enjoyed pushing those buttons, too… Hades and Prometheus would work hard to one up each other, most likely constructing a beautiful garden… and Hythlodaeus wouldn’t have to do a thing!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a casual wave of his hand, he Created a bag of popcorn as well, leaning back in his deck chair as Prometheus and Hades got to work."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But, where were Prometheus and Hades?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Being dressed lightly, he was snuggled up against Hades’s side, his fingers curled into the thick fabric of his robes as he tried to leech the warmth from them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was tidier, but he was flat on his back, the only sign of life being the steady rise and fall of his chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus pouted as he lowered his mask from where he had held it up admiringly, giving Hades an irritated look."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” Hythlodaeus chided quietly, “That’s rude.”  Hades didn’t seem overly bothered, but he did tip his chin down a little as he glanced at the mask in Prometheus’s hands."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It doesn’t… match,” Hades said as diplomatically as he could, “Colour-wise, it’s ugly.”  “Thank you!” Prometheus said cheerfully, giving Hades a look that clearly said  ‘see was that so hard’,  “I like your mask too, Hyth!”  Hythlodaeus smiled, quietly pleased, and Hades just sniffed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “So you can insult it as payback?” Hades said sourly, but he obligingly held up his mask."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It doesn’t look constipated,” Hades snapped, but he did give the mask a dubious once over, “Maybe I should soften some of the edges, though…”  Prometheus let Hades mull over his constipated mask, slipping on his much nicer on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That’s because your mask has no eye holes,” Hades said, the  ‘idiot’  heavily implied in his tone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He turned his head to ‘look’ at Hades, seeing the fuzzy, wavy outline of his soul, “I think this looks cool.”  Prometheus sighed in disappointment, taking off his mask as Hades and Hythlodaeus rose from the table."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But he had decades to figure it out, and… well, at least his didn’t look constipated like  Hades’s."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Behind him, Hades and Hythlodaeus were equally dubious."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We should just nap,” Hades grumbled, still sounding groggy from where Prometheus had dragged him out of his bed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I think he’s dead,” Hades finally said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Good thing you had all that snow to cushion your fall, huh?” Hades said idly, not even bothering to hide the amused tilt to his mouth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades clearly took pity on him, because he took an awkward step into the snow, leaning over to stretch his hand out to him, “Here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He had to lean over a lot - he jumped quite far, which he was now regretting - and he clasped Hades’s wrist tight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Um,” Prometheus started, eyeing the thick wall of snow separating him and Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Just walk,” Hades said grumpily, “I’m losing feeling in my legs here.”  -he dragged Hades down with him into the snow drift."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was  heavy  , certainly heavier than him, and Prometheus flailed uselessly under him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades is suffocating me!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I am not!” Hades squawked, vainly trying to get up - but with Prometheus squirming under him, and all the slippery ice under the snow, it wasn’t happening."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades?”  “Get your fat butt off me, Hades…!”  “Hades!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Birds exploded from the nearby tree in a panic when Hades and Prometheus  screeched."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A lot of Creations were like that nowadays: whims, passing thoughts and ideas, barely kept in check by the likes of Hythlodaeus and Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus stiffened at Hades’s voice coming from behind him, his heart thumping up in his throat as he  barely  fought back the instinctive flinch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades loomed over him, his mask not hiding the unhappy twist to his mouth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not that he was fooling Hades any, but the effort counted, right?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “More like I’ve been harassed by many annoyed scholars looking for  you,”  Hades said snippily, crossing his arms over his chest, “Why they think the fastest way to find you is through me, I’ll never know…”  Prometheus felt a flare of genuine amusement at that - he always did find it funny when he managed to inconvenience Hades in some way - and idly gestured for his glass butterflies to gently alight on the grassy ground."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He didn’t like Hades looming over him from behind like that, “You know, if you stopped doing that, maybe,  just maybe,  people will leave you alone.”  “Hn,” Hades tutted loudly, “If I did that, we’d never see you again.”  Hades didn’t immediately reply."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He was being scrutinised, Hades’s soul gently prodding at his, the sensation ghostly enough that he couldn’t help but shiver and clench his soul border’s tightly shut."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Nothing sparked Hades’s motherhenning and Hythlodaeus’s quiet concern looking like a reanimated corpse, like last time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” Prometheus said flatly, when the silence started to stretch awkwardly, even for them, “The staring’s kinda creepy.”  “I’m not staring,” Hades snapped, his feathers adorably ruffled like an offended water fowl’s, before he settled again, “Are you…”  Hades grunted, “Nothing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “-instead,” Hades continued, ignoring him, “We’re going to Hythlodaeus’s.”  “We,” Hades said mildly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It was yesterday,” Hades said, and there was concern there, buried deep in his tone and flashing through his soul like minnows in a shallow creek."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We’re going to Hythlodaeus’s,” Hades said in a tone that brooked no arguments, “We’re going to have tea, chat, and  then  you’re going to deal with your duties you’ve been ignoring for the past  month.”   Ah, he’s angry,  Prometheus realised, nervously smiling at Hades’s curt, sharp tone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He always found it funny, Hades’s temper."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even with only half of his face visible, Prometheus could see Hades go through several facial expressions."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “...don’t be an idiot,” Hades finally said, “There’s nothing to fix about you, except your terrible timekeeping, and no  armiger  will do that for you.”  “You don’t deal with it anyway,” Hades sighed, but his tense shoulders were slowly relaxing as the topic shifted from less emotionally dangerous waters, “That’s what we get for spoiling you as kids, I suppose.”  “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Hades sniffed, “Now stop distracting me and come here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus groaned and dragged his feet, made a show of it, because he was fulfilling a certain role now, but obediently moved over to Hades’s side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’s grip shifted from his elbow to his wrist, dragging him along as he pulled him forwards."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lazarus was created after Prom became a Convocation member, but before his relationship became romantic with Hades, and he continuously tweaked it up until he died summoning Hydaelyn."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Even  Emet-Selch  struggled to parse his words sometimes, and he was, like, a billion years old!” They didn’t exactly sit down with Emet-Selch and hash out an accurate timeline, “He was in his thousands.”  “My point still stands,” Aza sniffed, “If even Emet-Selch, who no doubt observed multiple linguistic evolutions in his time hopping between shards, struggled to understand Urianger, then  obviously  that man needs to modernise or simplify his words.”  “As you said before, I’ve lived a hard life,” Aza said blandly, “This whole business with the Lightwarden and Emet-Selch… honestly, it hasn’t registered much with me as something to get upset about."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades exhaled irritably, pointedly ignoring the banana Prometheus was waving a mere inch from his nose."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That horrid, yellow fruit kept obscuring his Concept notes every time Prometheus wiggled it, and Hades was half-tempted to smack it out of his hands."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “For the  love of-”  Hades snarled, snatching the stupid banana from Prometheus’s hand, “If I eat this will you  leave me alone?”  Prometheus leaned back, his hip resting against the edge of Hades desk with a self-satisfied smile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sometimes, Hades wondered why he loved this fucking fool."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hmph, if he was so determined to force feed Hades bananas, then he deserved it, honestly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus gaped at him, his eyes wide as he pointed wordlessly at his mouth - where Hades only just managed to choke down the banana with some liberal application of Creation magic."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades licked his lips, somehow feeling that awful, dry fuzziness that came from the peel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades just levelled him with a heavy-lidded look, “Didn’t you promise to leave me alone if I ate your horrid banana?”  Hades scoffed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Go ahead,” Hades said blandly, unbothered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades rolled his eyes and went back to his Concept notes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By this point Emet-Selch’s magic had faded, leaving the edges of the towering structures smeared and greyed, the Amaurotines translucent wisps whose voices buzzed with static."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Without Emet-Selch’s magic giving the city the appearance of wholeness, its layout was vastly different."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Considering this had been  under the sea  for possibly eons, Aza had a suspicion this was Emet-Selch’s doing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For whatever reason, Emet-Selch physically maintained this building despite its location under the sea, protected it from damage - or  rebuilt  it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Was this your home…?” Aza asked the empty house, half-expecting Emet-Selch to slither out of the shadows and sneer at him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Only  his, too, since he presumed only Emet-Selch would’ve known about this place."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A picture of a man with white hair and amber eyes, smiling warmly - he looked familiar, almost like Emet-Selch, but… the differences were too much for them to be anything but distant relatives."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch did say they could shapeshift the vessels they possessed to suit their tastes, though… Identical to Emet-Selch’s."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The… so, I need this- this message is for Emet-Selch, Hades- for him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Whoever listens to this message, please… tell him- Hades, please tell him I’m… I-I’m sorry, for what… for this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I know you’ll never forgive me, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thank you, Hades, for loving me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He squinted his eyes open to see Hades knelt at his side and scowling down at him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “  Prometheus  ,” Hades hissed, letting him go and jabbing him hard in his chest, “Did you sleep outside  all night  ?”  “...” Prometheus blinked very slowly, realising that the sky behind Hades was the dark blue of early morning."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Before he could wrangle his sore throat to croak this out, however, Hades pressed the back of his hand against his forehead, then against his cheek, checking his temperature."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’re  freezing  ,” Hades snapped, and he grabbed Prometheus by his biceps, forcing him to sit up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ugh, what’re you…” Prometheus rasped, flinching when Hades snapped his fingers and Created a thick blanket there and then."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He abruptly found himself aggressively wrapped up in it, his arms pinned against his chest as Hades levelled him with a grim look."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was  mad  ."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He huddled into his blanket, telling himself it was because he was cold, and not because he was cowering from Hades’s mood."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’s expression did something weird - like he was both disgusted yet concerned all at the same time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’s eyebrow twitched, and he let out a very slow, loud exhale."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was quickly followed up by Hades’s smoothing a hand over his hair, his fingers catching on Prometheus’s tangled, messy hair, tugging the worst of the knots out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Idiot,” Hades muttered with a sigh, “Why are you sleeping outside?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’s gaze sharpened, pinning him down with a scrutinising stare."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You should’ve called myself or Hythlodaeus if you were feeling sick,” Hades chided, but his lingering anger visibly cooled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Idiot,” Hades said again, this time more fondly, “Well, at least you have an excuse to trot out to Elidibus when he questions you about your absence.” Let’s warm you up inside before you freeze to death,” Hades ordered, grabbing Prometheus by the shoulders and coaxing him to stand up on his painfully stiff legs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades pressed a warm hand to the nape of his neck, followed by the sensation of healing magic sweeping through him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I should let you suffer to teach you a lesson,” Hades grumbled, but as usual he was all bark and no bite."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades would never willingly keep Prometheus in pain."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “But I never learn,” Prometheus joked croakily, unable to hold back a smile when Hades levelled him with an unimpressed look, “With you always cleaning up after me.” I spoil you too much,” Hades said, but he didn’t remove his hand, and neither did he stop the comforting wave of healing magic, gently urging him back towards his workshop, “I won’t always be around to look after you, you know."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was an old lecture, one Hades never paid attention to himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades loved fussing over him, no matter how much he griped about it, and Prometheus was scatter-brained enough to  need  fussing over."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades will always help him, and Prometheus will always need help."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He’ll always have Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, curiously, turned a little pink, looking away from with a loud  harrumph,  “Just- I wanted a blanket."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Another blanket abruptly dropped onto his head, Hades’s muffled voice muttering, “There."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They reached his front doorstep then, and he shot Hades a bright grin as he stepped into his home."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ah, whatever will I do without you, Hades?” he laughed playfully."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Die, probably,” Hades said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades found Prometheus two days after Zodiark saved them all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus handled that task, and it gave Hades time for this personal errand - finding Prometheus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades  knew  he lived."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Prometheus,” Hades breathed in relief, quickening his steps through the thick soot, his soul unfurling to reach out to the quiet, barely there ember of Prometheus- Hades froze, reeling from the dull pain that thrummed through him, bewildered and hurt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “...Prom?” Hades tried softly, his voice hushed like he was speaking to a wild, dangerous animal as he edged forwards again, “It’s me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It’s Hades.”  “It is,” Wary now, Hades stopped just out of arm’s reach, finding himself uncertain on how to proceed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But, no, if Hades did that, Prometheus would be furious."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Look at me,” Hades said, “Prometheus, look at me.” Hades barely held back a curse from the sight; Prometheus’s mask was gone, but his face was gaunt and dirty from soot and long dried blood, though there was no obvious injury on his face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh, Prom…” Hades breathed, “What have you done to yourself?”  “You’re-” Hades stopped, tamping down hard on the knee-jerk habit of scolding him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But, Hades knew better than to say that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It’s fine, everything is better now,” Hades murmured, reaching out - and pausing when Prometheus flinched away from him, “Prom, everything is  fine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Is still sick,” Hades confirmed, “But Zodiark will soon revitalise the land and restore it to how it once was."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Prom-” Hades bit down on the urge to snap, his hands dropping to rest on his knees, “Stop being stubborn and listen to me-”  “I did listen to you!” Hades protested, confused where  this  was coming from, “But you-”  Hades leaned back on his heels, unsure on how to deal with this sudden bubbling upsurge of foul, molten  resentment  heaving out of Prometheus’s soul."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I  told  you,” Prometheus continued, his voice cracking, “I  told you  , Hades!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “...one million,” Hades said, very quietly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “A worthy one, wouldn’t you say?” Hades murmured, “We survived.”  Prometheus laughed, a brittle, unhinged noise that made Hades’s skin crawl to hear, “Survived…?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I can  see it  , Hades!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He meant it, Hades realised with a low, swooping feeling in his chest, like he just missed a step on the steep stairs of the Akadaemia."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades saw, as the silence stretched between them, Prometheus’s savage expression of fury twist into one of unsettled confusion."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “...would you kill me, truly?” Hades said softly, “I doubt you’re capable of that type of cruelty, Prom.” That seething bubble of rage had fizzled into nothing, “You’re  not Hades-”  “I am,” Hades said, and he reached out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His will wavers,  Zodiark purred in his ear, His approval a warm balm to Hades’s soul,  He ever was a slave to emotion."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I am Hades, and you’re Prometheus,” Hades murmured, his voice gentle, “One soul in two bodies, remember?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus made a noise like he’d been knifed in the heart, and he leaned in a fraction, just a fraction, leaning into Hades’s hands as his eyes closed, a ragged breath leaving him-  “Come home, Prom,” Hades said, “Please.”  For the briefest of moments, Hades felt a flicker of bottomless, agonising grief open up like a gaping hole in Prometheus’s soul, so deep and empty it almost pulled him into it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “How is  any  of this pretending?” Hades said, struggling to keep a lid on his temper."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Prom,” Hades said quickly, feeling the air suddenly crackle with wild, untamed aether."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus’s aether  shrieked  , and in Hades’s Sight, that festering wound on his soul  ruptured."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades acted on sheer instinct alone, grabbing Prometheus and teleporting a few yards away as a monster crashed into the space they were mere moments ago."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades easily held him close, ignoring the vicious stamping on his toes as the  thing  undulated and twisted its unnatural, disgusting body towards them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had no idea."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A fitting, ugly creature for such a sickened soul,  Zodiark rumbled,  Bring him to me now, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could feel the dampness of tears soaking into his shoulder."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Shh…” Hades murmured, feeling Prometheus’s struggles start to weaken as he took a very slow, careful step back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was fairly sure he could outwalk the pathetic yet terrifying thing, “Shh, it’s okay."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades dismissed his delirious ramblings, giving one last look over the monster."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It looked as if it was figuring out its limbs enough to move now, but Hades saw no point in lingering."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’m taking you home,” Hades said, ignoring the despairing wail that left Prometheus from that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If Hades hadn’t been here… Hades felt something in him hesitate, the pause filled with Prometheus crying and the monster wailing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Bring him now, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With Hades always so close at hand, and Prometheus’s libido only really spiking when the man was involved, his masturbation sessions were so far and few in between."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had been busy though, so…  Prometheus’s movements stuttered to an abrupt halt when Hades’s voice intruded out of  nowhere  ."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He yelped, scrambling for his blankets as he quickly tossed them over himself, twitching when such abrupt, frantic movements made the beads  shift,  his face feeling like he could fry an egg on it as he stammered, “H-Hades!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, fresh from his office as he was still dressed in his robes, slowly started to grin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Just…?” Hades purred, swaggering inside properly and closing the door with a small flick of his fingers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Just…” Prometheus said breathlessly, making a tiny noise when Hades magicked the blanket away when he reached the edge of his bed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Everything was laid bare now, and he didn’t even hesitate to shift onto his back, to spread his thighs to let Hades get a nice, shamelessly eyeful of his state."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Having a good time,” Hades murmured, “Without me, I might add.” Hades’s eyes were dark and intense, reaching out to gently, teasingly, trail a featherlight path along the inside of Prometheus’s thigh, down, down, until… back up before he reached anywhere  fun,  pausing to tap an idle rhythm against his shaking knee  ."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Your message said you had an urgent matter for me to tend to,” Hades crooned, “But I didn’t expect it to be  this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus’s throat felt too dry to speak, his gaze fixed on Hades’s fingers slowly sliding down his thigh again, “Y… Yes…”  “  Yes,  ” Prometheus burst out in a breathless rush, his fingers clenching hard into the bedsheet under him when Hades’s hand dropped, vanishing out of sight between his legs, “Yes, I waited for  hours  but you didn’t come, so I-  uhhnn…”  Hades’s made a low, lovely noise of pleasure as he tugged firmly at the ring, forcing an anal bead to pull through Prometheus’s tight hole, “So you decided to play with your toys.”   “Fuck,”  Prometheus gasped, then choked when Hades  pushed  the bead back in, “Fuck…!”  “Not right now, you’re in the middle of playing with yourself,” Hades said, giving the ring one last, teasing tug - not enough to dislodge the bead again, but enough to make it press, buzzing and vibrating, against his rim until Prometheus  whined."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Now, be a good boy and finish…” Hades purred, settling back and pressing his hands against his knees, keeping Prometheus’s thighs spread wide, “Go on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It took a bit, Prometheus feeling dazed and clumsy under Hades’s hungry gaze."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He’d been pretty fucking close when Hades barged in, and fuck, fuck, he really needed to…  “Don’t be shy…” Hades encouraged, stroking his knee, “Go on, Prom.” He curled his hand around his aching dick, stroking a hard, fast rhythm, any lingering mortification from Hades’s presence quickly vanishing into the aether."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’s hand closed around his, forcing his rhythm to a stuttering, abrupt stop."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ah, ah,” Hades said over Prometheus’s strained, near-incoherent protest, “Too fast."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “  Hades,  ” Prometheus groaned, “I  need-”  “Not yet, you don’t,” Hades said smugly, his grin making Prometheus want to kiss him and strangle him at the same time, “  Slower  .”  And under the careful guidance of Hades’s  merciless  hand, Prometheus started up a slower pace."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Every time he’d come close, gasping and eyes rolling back, stars exploding behind his eyelids, Hades would force the pace slower, squeezing the base of his dick over the cockring until the cramp of orgasm passed and Prometheus descended even deeper into desperate insanity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “  Please, please, please,”  Prometheus whimpered, after a fucking  eternity  of this, his voice cracking from the sheer  need,  “Please, Hades, please, please-”  “Please what?” Hades murmured, his voice a low rumble."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He was fucked  stupid,  all he could say was please, over and over, and Hades, eventually, sighed fondly and took pity on him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Fine, fine,” Hades said, and Prometheus watched with unfocused, glazed eyes as slowly, gracefully, Hades settled himself between his spread, shaking legs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Their gazes met, Hades giving him such a self-satisfied look, before he slowly, torturously slowly, bent his head low and…  “Ah-  hhnn…  ” Prometheus felt like he died when Hades’s lips wrapped around his aching cock, his hips pinned down hard by Hades’s hands when he mindlessly tried to thrust into that wet heat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He couldn’t move, just writhe helplessly as Hades bobbed his head, down low, until his nose was buried into the dark curls of his pubes, throat closing around Prometheus’s cock, then pulling back, sucking hard on the tip, down, up, down, up down up downupdowndupdownup-  Then - thenthen  then  - Hades’s finger curled around that ring, and with one hard suck, one last deepthroating bob, he pulled and-  Prometheus practically  screamed  Hades’s name, mindlessly grasping at his partner’s hair as he squirmed and wailed as Hades’s  ruthlessly  pulled out every, single, fucking, bead as he shuddered through his orgasm, sucking him dry at the same time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Fuck fuck fuck  fuck fuck…  ” Prometheus babbled mindlessly, shaking like a leaf as Hades popped off his cock with a wet, obscene noise, his soul radiating a smug sense of ‘very pleased with himself’."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He felt like Hades just sucked his brains out of his goddamn cock he was that dazed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Dear,” Hades crooned, “Was that a bit too intense?”  Hades chuckled, and with a quiet snap his fingers, dismissed the cockring (much to Prometheus’s relief)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus tiredly opened his eyes, just as he saw Hades summon a wet cloth to hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You made quite a mess,” Hades murmured, catching his eye with a smirk, “Look at this.” His stomach was coated with smears of precum and tiny spurts of release from his near-orgasms, Hades gently and carefully mopping it up before banishing the soiled cloth to wherever it came from."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus squeaked when Hades suddenly lifted his leg, pushing it up as he summoned another cloth and, oh-  “H-Hades, I can clean myself there in a bit,” he said groggily, shivering at feeling the soft drag of cloth against his ass, cleaning up the smeared lube there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’m already here, so may as well,” Hades said easily, lowering his leg once he was done and banishing that cloth too."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus probably looked a right state - he  felt  like one - and Hades’s expression eased into something unbearably fond."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Really couldn’t wait, hm?” Hades said, kneading the inside of his thigh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hmm,” Hades made a low, rumbling noise, “Good.”  Hades patted his knee and got up from the bed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus listened to him sleepily for a bit, listened to him potter about the bedroom, a quiet snap of his fingers as he summoned - or banished something - then the mattress dipping when Hades climbed into bed next to him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “So, that toy of yours, the beads,” Hades started before Prometheus could fully drift off, “Is that a Private Concept you’ve approved of or…?”  Prometheus hummed and drowsed of after that, his mind already thinking of a good way to ‘introduce’ Hades first hand to those beads."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For torturing him like, Hades deserved a turn himself, right?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stared at them for a bit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It’s not a pad-” Hades stopped, realising there was a way to end this conversation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades!” Prometheus yelled, his voice still obnoxiously loud even through several inches of durasteel, “Don’t be rude!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades ignored him and went back to bed, too lazy to deal with Prometheus’s antics this early in the day (he stubbornly pretended not to acknowledge it was past noon at this point)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades wished him luck."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" (Later, Hades would retract his well wishing and instead curse that bastard droid’s very existence)  “I can’t believe Master Yoda actually let you knight it,” Hades said faintly, watching Prometheus stick the knife to Knifey with industrial grade gaffer tape."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades wondered if it was too late to kick Prometheus out of his quarters."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Being conservative Jedi that they were, the apartments they had were rather small, so the distance from Hades’s kitchen table to his front door was pretty much the length of his arm + lightsaber (which he only knew because once he tried to see if he could use his lightsaber to open his door without getting up out of his seat or exerting effort using the Force."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" However, trying to force Prometheus out of any room was like wrestling with a gundark and Hades was lazy, so he supposed all he could do was suffer as usual."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “So,” Hades said idly, “How does this work then?”  Hades pointed at the droid (sitting on his  kitchen table  he might add), “With every councillor he stabs, he’s promoted?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” Prometheus whispered after an uncomfortably long pause, “You’re a  genius.”  “Well, yes, of course I am,” Hades preened - then paused, “Wait, why am I?”  Hades looked at the future Jedi Emperor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In Hades’s opinion, this whole thing was getting out of hand, much like the time Prometheus managed to unionise the catering droids a few years back (they still hadn’t managed to bring them back to the negotiating table, meaning all the Jedi pulled straws for kitchen duty every week."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That, or Mace didn’t notice a two inch high cleaning droid charging at his shins,” Hades said flatly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades didn’t know why he let Prometheus invade his apartment anymore."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Look, Prom,” Hades said, decided to try and end this madness now, “This was funny for the first few days, but don’t you think it’s getting a bit… ridiculous, now?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “He’s- no,  it’s  a  droid  ,” Hades growled, “It’s  not  a Jedi!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’re so grumpy today,” Prometheus said, starting to smirk, “You know, anger’s a bad look on a Jedi, Hades~”  Hades felt his eye twitch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I,” Hades said stonily, “know where you sleep.” Hades threw his lightsaber at him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus dancing out of his apartment cackling like a buffoon, Knifey in tow, and Hades’s lightsaber smacking against the doorframe and breaking in half."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It took Hades the rest of his evening to fix his lightsaber."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Droids tended to develop erratic personalities and behaviours if you got too convoluted, so Prometheus programmed certain things like: ‘  any who use the Force are Jedi’  , and  ‘do not attack any sentients who are still considered Younglings’  and  ‘Priority Target: Jedi Master Hades Galvus’  ."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He looked up to feel Hades’s amusement curl against his soul’s border, and gave him a smile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It feels like it’s courting ill-luck, breaking tradition like this,” Hades teased playfully, betraying his unusually good mood."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, due to his role as overseer of all General Conceptions, was renowned for being skilled in all forms of magic, so he tended to ‘sub in’ for absent Convocation members in their respective fields."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Honestly, Hythlodaeus kind of liked the days where Hades led the audits and inspections, as he wasn’t as stern or pressuring as Lahabrea could be."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Unnerving?” Hades asked, looking interested for the first time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Then the risk of someone becoming a Primal’s thrall grows,” Hades muttered, “Have you limited further Primal development since you discovered this?”  Hades frowned, clearly not approving of the idea, “Perhaps we should err on the side of caution."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Strange,” Hades said, lifting his head-  “Stay here!” Hades barked, already pivoting on his heel and rushing out of his office."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades!” he cried, but Hades was already gone, and Hythlodaeus hesitated, unsure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Decision made, Hythlodaeus raced after Hades, down towards the heaving, aether of a newborn, fake God."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades hissed as he irritably smacked in his passcodes for the labs, wedging himself through the doors before they even fully opened."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades took a moment to even out his breathing (  running  was so plebeian, honestly), carefully scanning his surroundings."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" However, these labs were  huge  , and the hallways maze-like for those who did not regularly visit like Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Let’s see if I can pinpoint you…” Hades murmured, cautiously delving into the swirling, unsettled eddies of aether, to trace the bubbling trails back to its unnatural source-   Something  collapsing in the  very uncomfortably  close distance roared dully behind the lab’s thick walls, and Hades muttered a quiet curse."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades would have to get his, ugh, hands dirty."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stirred his aether into readiness, his mind flitting through his repertoire of combat-spells."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “H-Hades,” his wheezing friend gasped, “I want t-to help-” !” Hades snapped, cold fear washing through him at the thought of Hythlodaeus getting caught in a very messy crossfire, “Go!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" An ear-pitching, metallic  screech  almost made Hades stagger, and half-blinded as he was - the bubbling aether washing over him like a physical, boiling wave - he somehow managed to set  Titanomachy  off."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades rapidly backed up, his hastily erected shield diverting the worst of the boiling slag and chunks of wall thrown up from the explosion coming down on him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Titanomachy,” Hades confirmed tightly, standing just slightly in front of Hythlodaeus as he stared hard into the swirling smoke."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His expression hardening, Hades lifted his hand, just as a dark silhouette heaved itself out of the settling dust and smoke."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Its jaws were big enough to swallow an Amaurotine whole, Hades noted detachedly, as Hythlodaeus made a very quiet, horrified noise behind him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades couldn’t see any clear weak spots to target, and the sheer  power  rippling from the creature was giving him a headache."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It wants to eat us,” Hades said flatly, sweeping his hand over his face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “He wasn’t, clearly,” Hades muttered, breathing in deep, condensing his aether into multiple points, letting the pressure build like a tightly coiled spring."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Unfortunately, this did not end the fight immediately like Hades had hoped."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Which meant Hades must’ve slipped out while he was sleeping to do that boring old audit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus rolled onto his back, dragging Hades’s pillows over to him and making himself very comfortable as he felt out his surroundings."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Well, if he was going to be up and awake, he might as well spend his time annoying Hades and Hythlodaeus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “But Emet-Selch is dealing with it, right?” Someone else piped up, “I think, Hythlodaeus was with him too…”  “Are you telling me,” Prometheus asked in a low, silky voice, conveying a calm he certainly did not feel, “That Emet-Selch and Hythlodaeus are fighting a man-eating Primal in the Akadaemia’s basement…  alone  ?” Beneath it all, he could only  just  feel Hades and Hythlodaeus, like little candle lights flickering in the midst of a violent squall."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, he wasn’t overly concerned about."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He picked up several combat-spells from Prometheus too, and if worse came to worst, Hades was very quick at crafting a new body for himself if his physical form got too damaged."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But, no, Prometheus fully intended to swoop in, pluck Hythlodaeus from the jaws of danger, and leave Hades to mop up this mess while he checked their friend over."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Surely, Hades could deal with  one  little rogue Primal, right?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ”  Hades groaned."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades immediately steadied him, his hands grasping his arm, and then- ah, better."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Their souls quickly moved in tandem, until  Valstrax  was solid and unbending, the ultimate defence, bolstered by the harmony between his and Hades’s souls, as the Primal rampaged futilely against the unmoving barrier."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “People,” Hades said flatly, “Are you hurt?” He could still feel a faint thrum deep inside of him, but it was shared by Hades, so it barely hurt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Well, I was just planning on rescuing you and leaving Hades here,” Prometheus admitted, keeping a close eye on the Primal."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades gave him a deeply unimpressed look."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades made a weird face, like he wasn’t sure whether to be annoyed at his callousness, or pleased at having his ego-stroked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “As much as it pains me to admit it,” Hades muttered, “Your help  would  be nice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades started at him flatly, “Prom."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Any spell that would, as you say,  annihilate  the Primal would  also  bring the whole complex crashing down on our heads!” Hades snarled, “Do you  want  Elidibus to murder us both in our sleep for destroying  yet another  important structure!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There was a pause, one where Prometheus and Hades stared at their friend."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What-  yeet  ?” Hades frowned, “What the hell is  ‘yeet’-  ”  “We’re sending it to the void,” Hades interrupted sharply, “Where it can die in miserable solitude."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Alone, Prometheus doubted Hades, or even himself, could have achieved it, if only because the moment they hooked the teleport spell onto the Primal’s aether, the creature  thrashed  like a greased up eel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It slipped and wriggled continuously out of their grip, Prometheus and Hades only just snatching it back the moment it briefly freed itself, until, finally,  finally,  they got the teleport spell to stick  long  enough to punt it into a fast-flowing aether channel into the Rift."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades just grunted, slowly lowering himself onto the floor until he was sprawled out on his back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Need a shower… I think Hades is dead, though.”  “Nnnngh,” Hades protested somewhere on the floor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, the bastard, was pretending to be passed out on the floor, so the emotional labour was Prometheus’s responsibility, no matter how ill-equipped he was to deal with it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus left him to it, and instead booted Hades in the ribs to get him moving."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" imagine it ended with an OT3 of Hades\/14th\/Hyth in hades's apartment ok?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Until Hades came, that is."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was in a spark of aether, Hades’s teleports always bombastic to Prometheus’s senses."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His ‘true form’ lacked physical eyes, but his Sight was sharper than ever, picking out the calm, muted ripples that made up Hades’s soul - dark colours, swirling like rustling leaves in dim shadows."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” he greeted, his voice a rumbling purr, “Rare for you to visit on these days.”  “I was bored,” was Hades’s reply, his soul fluctuating briefly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades cursed when he almost lost balance, “Come to gawk then.”  “Admire, more like,” Hades corrected, coming closer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His palm was small compared to the size of Prometheus’s body, but the warmth of contact swept through the whole limb, especially when Hades’s soul opened up for him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades sitting on the grass, his hand resting on his arm, the both of them sinking deep into one another."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus could feel the strong, calm  ‘thmp thmp thmp’  of Hades’s soul-pulse alongside his own heartbeat, a sensation that lulled him into a sense of drowsiness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Are you planning on sleeping all day?” Hades asked idly, his voice drawing Prometheus out of his small doze, “How lazy of you.”  “In my defence, I was annoyed at you,” Hades said bluntly, idly drawing shapes on his arm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus remembered: he had achieved this form before Hades found his."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He couldn’t fully recall the details, but Hades had gotten huffy about it, Prometheus had been a little too smug, and it resulted in a ten year cold shoulder that was thankfully never repeated."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Yeah, you got jealous,” Prometheus teased, shifting his arm to gently nudge Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even then, his sheer size almost made Hades topple over, his friend’s aether flaring irritably from the near trip."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I wasn’t  jealous,”  Hades sneered, swatting his arm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh shut it,” Hades huffed, but his soul was twinkling in poorly concealed amusement - and something else, deeper, hotter, fiery, “At least I didn’t overcompensate when crafting my true form.”  Hades’s aether flared, and Prometheus yelped when he felt a flood of icy cold water abruptly drop over his groin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It still felt the full brunt of that  freezing cold  water, and he quickly rolled onto his belly, grinding against the grass to warm it up as he hissed; “  Hades!”  “That’s what you get for flashing it about,” Hades drawled, sounding utter unrepentant, the  asshole,  “It’s like an irresistible target.” ?”  Hades sounded so scandalised it was ridiculous, and Prometheus didn’t bother stifling his amusement when he felt his friend’s aether swell tellingly, prepping to shed his physical shell, “I’ll show you  teeny tiny t-rex arms  !”  Stars, Hades was so easy to wind up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus tossed his head with a snort, his Sight seeing Hades’s soul expand and blossom, becoming darker yet deeper, the aether singing through their bond almost making him dizzy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The surge of power always left him feeling a bit drunk, when Hades pulled on this form."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “There!” Hades boomed, his voice warbling slightly in this form, “See, my arms are-”  “I’m blind in this form, remember?” Prometheus drawled, quivering when Hades’s absolute  indignation  filtered through their bond like a physical prickle of static shock, “I can’t physically see you.”  “You… absolute…” Hades trailed off, and Prometheus felt a heavy, clawed hand sink into his thick mane, roughly shaking his head from side to side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus’s body was bestial, heavier, more limbed than Hades’s still humanoid yet sinewy form."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’s torso felt soft, too much give beneath the velvety cloth acting as a pseudo-robe when Prometheus wrestled him onto the grass beneath him, pinning his arms down - the bulky, clawed ones,  and  the tiny t-rex arms (no matter what Hades said, they were  comically tiny  ), his fangs snapping close to the metallic mask covering Hades’s face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’ve won,” Prometheus purred, his hot breath fanning over Hades’s mask, pressing all his weight down on him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades didn’t so much as grunt, “I’ve  won~”  “Only an idiot gloats pre-maturely,” Hades purred back just as confidently, and a twinkle of mischief darted through his aether, “Especially when they forget an important detail…” Hades’s true form was heavily reliant on arcane arts, as opposed to physical confrontation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Trapped like this, Hades couldn’t cast his magic, and Prometheus had the advantage."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’re bluffing,” he decided, pressing his snout where Hades’s throat would be, were he human still, worrying at the velvety hide with the tips of his fangs, “It won’t work~”  Hades shivered beneath him - Prometheus felt a flare of triumph - then; a cold, smooth tendril coiled around his snout and snapped his jaws shut."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh, Prom, Prom, Prom…” Hades crooned, not moving from his now languid sprawl beneath him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus couldn’t do anything except shiver, panting shortly when one particularly bold tentacle probed at the slit of his sheathe, slowly stroking up and down, up and down… heat pooled quick and fast low in Prometheus’s belly, and he made a muffled, strained noise when he realised what Hades was up to."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Depending entirely on brute strength like an animal always opens yourself up to these things,” Hades said idly, prying Prometheus’s hands off his wrists."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He felt the sharp scratch of Hades’s claws against his throat, digging into the gaps between his scales as his tentacle slowly, gently, teasingly coaxed his cock out of its sheathe."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" of Hades’s tentacles."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He was entirely on display, entirely at Hades’s mercy, unable to move and speak unless he willed it, and it was simultaneously terrifying and thrilling all at once, his heart thumping a wild beat in his throat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His throat where Hades’s small, clawed hand gently squeezed, compressing his windpipe just enough to make him gasp, but not enough to choke."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Luckily, I’m a very  generous  captor…” Hades purred."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It squeezed and undulated, pumping him with a brisk efficiency that had him keening low in his throat, hips trembling violently as he tried to thrust, but held fast by Hades’s tentacles."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Just a taste,” Hades told him as Prometheus moaned mindlessly, and the tendril around his snout loosened up enough for his jaws to part- and for a tentacle to shove itself right into his mouth, cock-shaped and slick, tasting of something strange yet addicting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All he could hear was the wet noise of it repeatedly fucking him over and over, his own muffled grunts and moans and whines as his mouth was fucked over and over again, and Hades’s own quieter, yet fast-paced breathing as his soul blazed beneath him like an inferno."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That’s it, that’s it, good boy,” Hades muttered roughly, “You can come so many times, can’t you?”  “Again,” Hades ordered, his tentacle thrusting deep inside of him, pressing hard against a sweet spot that had Prometheus forgetting what breathing was."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus had no idea how long it lasted - just, Hades’s voice, murmuring, crooning, praising him (  “again, like that, good boy,   again   ”)  as he was delicately torn apart piece by blissful piece, his soul erupting and peaking and shuddering in bolts of white and colours he didn’t know  existed, the ecstasy never truly stopping until- until- Hades was crooning at him, tendrils delicately tucking his body into a more comfortable position, a clawed hand stroking through his mane as Prometheus moaned dazedly into the ground, fucked absolutely  stupid."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It seems  I  win,” Hades hummed, gently picking Prometheus’s head up enough to rest his chin on Hades’s approximation of a lap."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Exactly,” Hades said fondly, patting his snout, “Tentacles trump brawn.”  It took a while for some semblance of wits to limp their way back into Prometheus’s fucked out skull, and when they did, he groaned at realising just how  thoroughly  Hades  destroyed  him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His limbs were as limp as soggy noodles, his soul so burnt out it couldn’t put up a fight when Hades cradled it, rippling through it with gentle undulating waves."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades really did win that one."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Now, you’re just easy to trick,” Hades said simply, “Honestly, you fall for it every time…” He made a note, though: next time he fought Hades in their true forms, find a way to mitigate his horrible tentacles."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sometimes, Hythlodaeus couldn’t decide if Hades and Prometheus were made for each other, or  utterly incompatible."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It did mean it never stagnated, there was always some new hurdle for them to overcome in some way (normally a hurdle of their own making), and, if anything, Hades and Prometheus enjoyed their arguments and disagreements in some weird way."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I am  just saying,”  Prometheus snapped hotly on Hythlodaeus’s left, taking up most of the sofa and jabbing a very threatening, half-eaten breadstick Hades’s way, “If you stop contributing to the plastic waste choking our planet and get a damn recycling bin-”  “And  who  is going to sort through the recycling and drive it to the tip, Prometheus?” Hades said waspishly, not even looking up from his mobile phone, “  You?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus and Hades obligingly paused, the pair of them eyeing each other with barely contained, passionate energy while Hythlodaeus confirmed that yes, Tuesday did indeed sound good for his check up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades let out a bark of laughter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh, well, at least you set aside time for  recycling,  ” Hades muttered, aggressively swiping up on his phone, “Glad to know that’s one of your top priorities.”  Hythlodaeus and Hades both tuned him out at the exact same time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades continued reading the news on his phone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Fine,” Hades sighed, locking his phone and setting it down on his lap, “I’ll get us a recycling box, if only to shut you up.”  “  But,  ” Hades cut in, thrusting a finger in Prometheus’s direction, “You  will  share responsibility for it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked sour, and Hythlodaeus bit the inside of his cheek so he wouldn’t say anything."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It looked like Hades was still upset over Prometheus missing half of their anniversary last week because he’d decided wading through bogland doing bird ringing was more important."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For one moment, Hythlodaeus thought Hades was going to admit the real reason behind his mood, but instead, after a tense pause, Hades just grunted and slouched down on the sofa as well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “In the lead up to Starlight, yes,” Hades muttered, “Just the usual.”  Prometheus looked from him, to Hades, and back again, frowning a little."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Well, instead of brooding in Hades’s living room, we should do something fun, then,” Prometheus said, jumping to his feet with a sudden burst of energy, “And I know  exactly  what we can do!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades groaned dramatically."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Yes, that’s exactly what I’m grumpy about,” Hades said dully."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Well, I think a lovely walk through nature would do us some good,” Hythlodaeus said, ignoring the betrayed look Hades shot him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sorry, Hades, but this was for your own good."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" C’mon, Hades~” So, in this modern au: Prom is an ornithologist, Hyth an architect and Hades a lawyer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They all have their own places to live but somehow they all end up crashing Hades's apartment so it's p much their home now LMAO  Hades would scoff at that and Hythlodaeus would nod but disbelieve… Prometheus, however, smiled, nodding in total agreement."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Like, when Hades had that cold, his aether was all sluggish and bleh.”  “You were told correctly,” she said, carefully circling to the main issue she wanted to confront all along, “Did Hades or Hythlodaeus tell you that?”  She hoped Hades and Hythlodaeus wouldn’t tease him overly much."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" (Hades, especially, who she was seeing worrying signs of possessiveness regarding his agemates."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus grumbled irritably as Hades tugged at his duvet, dislodging him from his comfortable cocoon of pillows and blankets."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prom, Hades grunted, quickly giving up, \"Ugh, it's too early for this.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus cautiously peeked over the edge of his duvet, bleary-eyed, to see Hades sprawled out next to him, one arm flung over Prometheus’s blanket burrito."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hythlodaeus is going to be annoyed if we’re late,” Hades mumbled, looking as unmotivated as Prometheus felt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a grunt, he lifted it up and, without hesitating, Hades lazily rolled over and under the duvet with him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’s robes smelled like fresh paper - ah, he must’ve been daydreaming about curling up with a good book when Creating them - and Prometheus pressed his face into his shoulder with a smile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus’s cut off curse turned into a breathless cough that was reminiscent of an abused squeak toy getting stamped on - all thanks to Hades’s  lethally  pointy elbow driving hard into his gut from their rough landing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades!” Hythlodaeus huffed over them, dropping the mattress back onto its frame, “Do you know how  late  you are?”  “Hythlodaeus!” Hades snapped, scrambling up from his ungainly sprawl over Prometheus’s squirming body, “What the  hell  !"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had nothing to say to that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “No, we weren’t,” Hades said peevishly, “Prometheus, you don’t need to shower."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Didn’t you say we were late?” Hades snapped, already marching past a grinning Hythlodaeus, “Stop chatting and let’s go.” In this case he and Hades were of one mind, the pair of them finding social parties positively  exhausting  and avoiding them at All Costs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At this point, they reached the front door where Hades was waiting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I don’t want to go to the party,” Hades said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades and Prometheus exchanged looks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And people make speeches,” Hades added with equal grouchiness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades grunted, “I’ll be giving it to her later.” Hades hated his gift being scrutinised by a crowd."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He felt self-conscious, despite Hades and Hythlodaeus not being judgemental."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His gaze slid over to Hades, “What do you think?”  “I’m thinking we should get this over with,” Hades muttered, not even looking their way."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus shot Hades a look, “You always fail to read the mood, Hades…”  “It’s fine!” Prometheus said quickly, when Hades started to frown, stowing his gift safely back in his internal inventory."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was just a hop and skip to the ballroom from there, and Prometheus immediately shrank back until he was trailing behind Hythlodaeus and Hades when the noise of  existence  rose to a jarring crescendo that made his head hurt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We’ll wait then,” Hades sighed, “Is there a dark corner I can hide in?” It wasn’t really all that better, he was still being buffeted on all sides by all this  noise,  but at least he and Hades could sulk together in the corner without being bothered by people wanting to chat with Convocation members."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades suddenly cursed, and his soul fluttered, a snap of his fingers - and it was like a soundproof blanket had been tossed over him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Tingling in that unique way only Hades’s soul did, warm and soothing, muffling the grinding roar of hundreds of souls into a tolerable, distant mumble."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I forgot,” Hades said, a bit stiffly, when Prometheus blinked in surprise at him, “About that.”  Hades lazily kicked his ankle, drawing his attention back, “Is your headache gone?”  Hades just stared at him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “She,” Hades repeated, “You’re humanising your  armigers  now?”  “Emet-Selch?” A small gaggle of scholars - from the Concept Inspection Department, if Prometheus recognised their masks correctly - immediately crowded around Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Unless it’s urgent, it can continue to wait,” Hades said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not many approached  the 14th  for a myriad of reasons, mostly due to his own faulty personality and esoteric knowledge, and while he told himself that was preferred (he’d lose his mind if he got mobbed as often as Hades did), he couldn’t help but feel mildly put out at times."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Upon seeing Hades contending with a stubborn group of scholars (and sounding increasingly grumpy about it), he sighed and shook his head, coming to a slow stop beside Prometheus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Poor Emet-Selch,” Hythlodaeus said, “So esteemed he can’t escape work even at our mentor’s birthday party.”  “Let’s leave him to it,” Hythlodaeus suggested, and without a backwards glance, the pair of them abandoned Hades to his work."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh,  damn it-  er, I mean, hello, Hythlodaeus,” Hephaestus, a rather short Amaurotine with a flat, pale blue mask, “Rare to see you out from under Emet-Selch’s wing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hey,  I’m  not average,” Nyx groused, “Emet-Selch approved of my structural Concepts a few decades ago, and now they’re being implemented this year!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh, I’m so jealous… Emet-Selch  and  the Fourteenth…” Nyx sighed, “I heard you were offered a title too, Hythlodaeus?”  “Let’s go see if Hades has been devoured alive yet,” Prometheus suggested brightly, forcing his mood into lighter, better areas, “I wanna see if that overenthusiastic admirer of his has stalked him here.”  “I find it amazing you aren’t bothered in the slightest about such an aggressive love rival,” Hythlodaeus said, “Hades would be frothing with jealousy in your position.”  “Well, that’s because Hades is an idiot,” Prometheus drawled, “I, like any mature adult, trust my partner to  not  go skipping off into the sunset with the first person to show him interest.”  “Urgh,” Hythlodaeus grimaced, “Hades  skipping  .” If there was one thing that never failed to buoy Prometheus’s mood, it was ribbing on Hades behind his back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ah, I see him!” Hythlodaeus said, pointing at a gaggle of scholars, an irate Hades at its core, “Oh dear, he’s looking very annoyed.”  “I think that’s just his face,” Prometheus said, vanishing his now empty plate and watching Hades get mobbed, “Hey… Hyth…” Beside him, Hades didn’t look much better, radiating the same aura as a pissed off cat as they skulked through Mentor Metis’s front door, trailing water everywhere."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Being so old, she practically towered over them, making Prometheus feel like a child all over again, discovered pulling naughty pranks on Hades as per usual."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Prom summoned a localised rainstorm, Mentor,” Hades snitched immediately, like  usual  ."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades did not look very grateful about this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We haven’t  scuffled  since we were kids,” Hades grouched, ignoring how Prometheus and Hythlodaeus stared at each other in disbelief at that  blatant lie  ."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “At least someone enjoyed it,” Hades grunted sourly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “  You  ?” Hades scoffed, “It can’t be called ‘being in disguise’ if no one recognises you in the first place.” Stymied by good manners, Hades and Prometheus sullenly stopped their squabbling and settled in for mandatory pleasantries."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Before Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was three in the morning and Hades hated every minute of it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Will you stop scowling,” Prometheus swatted his shoulder, jerking Hades out of his hazy, drowsy thoughts, “It’s bringing the mood down.”  “Hn,” Hades grunted, blinking his eyes open, “Are you almost ready?”  “How kind,” Hades said insincerely."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stood up from where he’d been languishing on the nearest flat surface."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Religious nonsense, Hades thought, but no one was willing to stop doing the ritual,  just in case."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades supposed it was supposed to be an angel, or something, but at this point was just a stumpy lump of stained marble."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “No, I’m fine,” Hades snapped, making a shooing gesture at him, “Go on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He just sighed, rolled his shoulders, and then walked up to the altar, Hades a few steps behind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The thing was, Hades didn’t have a particular role to play in this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was here to drag his friend back to the surface and ensure he didn’t die from aether exhaustion along the way (the cause of death of many a Fourteenth back in the ‘old days’)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was never recorded, and Prometheus always gave him a weird look when he asked, so Hades chalked it up to the Convocation being overly cautious as per usual."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus stopped in front of the altar, and Hades made himself comfortable about four metres away, conjuring a plush armchair and sinking into it, crossing his legs at the ankles as he slouched."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Once upon a time, this chamber probably looked grand, Hades mused idly as Prometheus began to settle into a near meditative state."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Those prehistoric believers incorrectly assumed the star they lived on to be a  living creature,  and while Hades agreed the planet was to be respected and cared for, elevating it to the level of a god and performing meaningless rituals to its name was a step too far."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Lifestream fluctuated sharply, and Hades dragged his attention back to Prometheus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades soul was like a smouldering ember at his back - sleepy and low-burning, content to sit and wait until Prometheus was done."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus blanked him out, because Hades always pissed him off on this day if he paid him too much attention, and focused instead on the sluggish eddies of the Lifestream."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades made a questioning noise behind him, but Prometheus waved him off."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And, as always, before his knees hit the stone underneath him, Hades caught him by gripping under his arms and easing him down."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’ve finished,” Hades told him, his voice sounding so very far away, “Your self-inflicted torture session is over.” He was completely limp in Hades’s arms, and the world swirled nauseatingly as he was jostled - colours streaked like moving comets, his unfocused eyes unable to make out anything clear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Or, well, he would, if Hades stopped  looming  threateningly over him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Fishing,” Hades repeated after a long, disbelieving pause, “You’re  fishing  .”  “I’m  stressed,  ” Hades gritted out, his shoulders hunching like an agitated vulture, “Because  someone  has not been appearing at the Convocation meetings for the past  week."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You?” Prometheus replied, angling a vindictively amused grin Hades’s way, “Aw, have I made your life difficult, Hades?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “  I’m going to drown you,  ” Hades snarled, “Unless you pull up that line, put your robes back on and  get back to work,   Fourteenth  .”  “  Vaca-”  Hades cut himself off, his voice strangling into a brief squeak of high-pitched rage."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It’s okay, he’s had his fun... and also Hades might very well follow through with that drowning threat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the corner of his eye, he saw Hades wrestle with his anger, simmering down into a dull kind of annoyance as he realised Prometheus wasn’t pulling his leg."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was downright hilarious, watching Hades deflate from his righteous fury into something so childishly  sullen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Blasted bureaucracy,” Hades muttered, crossing his arms over his chest, “All that time wasted looking for you, for  no reason  .”  Hades hesitated, so Prometheus turned his attention back to the lake."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After knowing each other for so long, he knew how Hades ticked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In which case, what kind of fish would Hades be…?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After a long, tense moment, Hades let out an explosive sigh and hiked up his robes, so the shallows didn’t soak the hems."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “An hour,” Hades said, sitting on the stool and conjuring his own rod, “One hour.”  Hades wasn’t an experienced fisher, but, as an Amaurotine you didn’t need to be one to fish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades cast his line and simply sat there, watching his lure without really watching it, his mind immediately going elsewhere entirely."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Well, firstly, the Fourteenth’s aether sensitivity meant he could sense a spell targeted towards him from  miles away;  secondly, the Fourteenth’s magical constitution was so robust it took someone of Emet-Selch’s power to make him  drowsy  , let alone unconscious; and thirdly, the Fourteenth had done so many borderline-legal “self-improvements” on himself that Rhea wouldn’t be surprised if he was fucking  immune  to magical ailments at this rate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “-fine, sorry, that was foolish of me,” Exarch said, then pointedly paused before adding, “But, silly sacrificial plans or not, at least I didn’t plan to fight Emet-Selch alone and  underwater  .”  “And- well, Emet-Selch didn’t look very aerodynamic- or, whatever the water equivalent is."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In retrospect, Hades shouldn’t have been surprised that Prometheus decided to run away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades huffed quietly to himself as he hiked up the uneven trail."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Normally Hades wouldn’t do anything as plebeian as hiking, but on the fringes of Zodiark’s protection, where the earth was still tainted from the Calamity, the aether was mangled and coiled like a rotten gordian knot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades tracked it over the undulating ground, dark grey and grooved, the volcanic rock telling a silent story of a past eruption that went unnoticed during the recent chaos."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As Hades reached the top of a small hill, offering him a wide view of what remained of the island, all he saw was ash, volcanic rock, and a half-crumbled mountain."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was there, in the ruins of the village, that Hades eventually found Prometheus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What do you want,” Prometheus muttered as Hades drew to a slow stop before him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I came to check up on you,” Hades said, keeping his tone idle, like it was perfectly normal to stalk his friend halfway across the ruined world, “Your seat is still open for your return.” “I wasn’t worried about that,” Hades half-lied."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades said nothing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sometimes Hades hated him for it - if he had survived, maybe, as always, he could have bridged this gap of misunderstanding between him and Prometheus, made him stay- “...you returned with a basketful of grapes,” Hades picked up the story when the silence threatened to snap into frigid awkwardness, “And marched right into your disciplinary meeting with it, presenting it as evidence for why you shouldn’t be censured.” “He forgot he hated you for a whole hour,” Hades agreed, “Quite an achievement.” “Yeah…” Prometheus’s smile faded, and his gaze settled back on him, “What do you want, Hades?” Hades sighed and took a few steps closer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prometheus didn’t move as he flopped down tiredly next to him on the statue, their shoulders pressed together, Hades pressing the side of his thigh against Prometheus’s, a warm line of contact that didn’t take the edge off the homesickness that plagued him since his oldest friend left him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You can’t stay out here for eternity,” Hades told him, and chanced reaching out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He squeezed Hades’s hand, turning his head away so Hades could only see his face in profile, see the way his mouth pulled into a ghost a grin - the sort he did when he wanted to ruffle Hades’s feathers, “I can run forever, if I want.” He lent close so they were nose to nose, so all Hades could see were those stormy, brilliant golden eyes, “You, the Convocation… you chose a path of cowardly selfishness.” Hades didn’t rise to the bait."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It was the only path,” Hades said quietly, “A shit decision in a shit situation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades said nothing, because it was true."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had thought it strange at the time, as Prometheus tended to deal with such situations locally, a bit of an infamous maverick that the Convocation was used to fondly rapping the knuckles of - it should’ve raised red flags, but it had been brushed off because Prometheus would deal with it like he always did."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I know,” Hades murmured."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And now everything is wrong,” Prometheus pulled away from him, still tightly gripped Hades’s hand as he twisted his whole body away, curling in on himself, voice taut and trembling like his soul, “Hyth is dead, everyone - all my- everywhere is…” “I know,” Hades repeated."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Come back to Amaurot,” Hades said, “Things will be better if you do.” “No,” Prometheus was still curled away from him, even as his hand squeezed the life out of Hades’s fingers, “I can’t- go back there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades tried not to be unsettled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It’s exhausting chasing you over the horizon,” Hades sighed, injecting some exhausted levity to his voice, “I’m not made for long treks, you know that.” Hades could see a few tears drip onto his thigh, his head still turned away, “Y’know?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Yeah,” Hades said, looking away so he didn’t see when Prometheus wiped the tears from his cheeks, “I’m not made for physical exertion.” Hades stared out across the ruined village."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Always,” Hades promised, “I’ll chase you wherever you go.” Prometheus was his guiding star, and Hades would follow it endlessly, no matter how many horizons it took him beyond."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades understood."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Choose someplace cheerier next time, though,” Hades murmured, letting his mouth quirk into a smile that was more Hythlodaeus than him, “The ash and ruin is a bit of a turn off.” Hades held him up, squeezed his hand, and stayed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was patient."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Turns out I’m total Emet-Selch trash and think he deserves more cuddles."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Tis never easy to lose the ones we love.” Emet Selch slowly walked towards the group as they spoke to Runar."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet Selch did his best to ignore how the Warrior of Light trembled with barely contained sobs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet took a step back as the large leonine stripped male ran passed him and scooped the woman off the ground and held her close."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I thank you for bringing her back to us Emet Selch.” That bewildered look was once more on his face as he looked down at her, and then slowly his gaze dropped to where she held his hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Instead Emet Selch looked down at his hand, still feeling the warmth of her touch and it was a sad, pained look that was on his face as he slowly flexed the hand she had been holding."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She looked at Emet Selch as he spoke of his home world, a soft pang burnt in her chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Chest aching from it as Emet Selch continued on, in a softer voice as if just speaking the words, he was reliving those very moments."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet, I-“ words were softly choked out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It had been so heartfelt and so honestly said, so unlike how Emet normally spoke."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You thought ancient beings like us incapable of crying?” His lashes slowly lowered and his voice got quieter as Emet continued to speak, “Well, rest assured that if your heart can be broken, then so can mine.” He couldn’t continue to meet her eyes, looking off to the side, voice soft as he tried to keep a rein on his emotions."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Back when the world was whole, we had family, friends, loves...” so desperate was he for her to remember, even a single thing, Emet couldn’t help but to speak those words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He should have-Hades shook his head violently, interrupting that particular train of thought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades” his true name slipped out as he pulled her bra off of her and tongued one pert nipple."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’ breath came out in a pained chuckle as he looked up from his position near her abdomen, hands playing with her breasts idly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She could almost taste his pleasure in the air as Hades started to move again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Please what hero?” Hades teased fingers toying with the now damp fabric of her underwear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Giving one last swipe of his tongue, Hades kissed his way back up her body."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His erection sprang free and Hades gave a small groan in response as her hands went to slide against his length."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Leaning into her touch, Hades grabbed her other hand and laced their fingers together, while moving their joined hands to rest next to her head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades dropped one hand down between their bodies and lightly brushed her clit, matching his strokes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades dropped kisses along the column of her throat, claiming, biting kisses."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A couple of short pumps is all Hades managed before he released into her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Slowly, Hades slumped against her as he caught his breath, resting his forehead against her collarbone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Breath hitching at that revelation as Hades slowly moved, those vibrant golden eyes looking into hers and seeming to measure her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I guess after the appointed number I’ll just have to-“ her words were cut off by a harsh kiss, as Hades let her know what he thought of that, but without words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Another with Emet-Selch, because I honestly can't help myself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not with Emet-Selch pressing against her, chest to chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Succor to you, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades tried to keep himself in the here and now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A shuddering thrust from Emet-Selch at her words tipped her over into a sweet release."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch pressed his forehead against hers, the milky third eye pressing into her brow, slightly cooler than the rest of his skin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It must end, just-', Hades didn't even need to finish the thought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I won't leave you Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And yet Emet-Selch is taking advantage of that fact, only his golden eyes visible in the darkness of your room within the Crystarium."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch was not a man, a being, above using his strength to make you...behave."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch, please,” you cry out, fingers gripping his robes as tight as you can manage in your lust induced haze."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You are barely able to slide out of Emet-Selch’s hold when he appears, moving like water to flow to the other side of the room."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You frown as you find Emet-Selch behind you once again, turning immediately to face him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It is in the time between the seconds Emet-Selch is not near that you get to read over these tomes, trying to find out anything at all about who you are."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lahabrea had no qualms about trying to end your life after all, and for reasons beyond your understanding, Emet-Selch didn’t hold his death against you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Looking up, Emet-Selch stands before you, though now he is a sizable distance away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Exciting, in that it is like opening a third eye; that sixth sense that you had felt when Emet-Selch’s darkness had reached out for your light, mingling with it, caressing you just as he would with mortal hands."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You could read the Scions, because they had opened their hearts to you, making the weight of the feelings you had felt from Emet-Selch that much greater."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was not a question of if Emet-Selch would hurt them, just knowing he could was enough to stay your hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You feel like you lied, telling Emet-Selch you couldn’t drown."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Such fanciful words, Emet-Selch...are they not better reserved for your lover?” you ask, your voice timid, but not at all small."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s eyes are warm as they gaze upon you, as warm as afternoon sun beaming down on you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You are a show off, Emet-Selch.” you pout, despite the erratic beating of your heart."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades.” “H-Hades,” you cry out as you finally fall over the edge, stars dotting your vision as you moan his name, his real name."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “H-Hades,” The thought of being connected with Emet-Selch, Hades, sent your heart to flutter like the wings of a butterfly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’m here, Hades.” You whisper, allowing him to hold you tight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” you cry out as his teeth bite down, breaking skin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades, I’m...” Possessiveness flares through the connection, so strong that it threatens to overwhelm you as he laps at the blood that flows forth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” Hades is quick to react, kissing your tears away as he brings you close to him again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “A ritual, that you know of too well Emet-Selch.” you speak lowly, not bothered by his frown."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch,” “Hades,” “Please Hades, more,” you beg, finally giving in, whining as he slows his pace."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Well I must, if they cause such beautiful magic to be created.” Emet-Selch’s laugh is as clear as a bell, making you turn to face him once more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch,”  “You are tempered, Emet-Selch, you are but a slave to the will of Zodiark,” Your words are cut off by being pinned to the wall, eyes wide as a red mask glows before you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” you whimper, struggling in his hold."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades please, there must be another way,” I will find another way!” You cry, doing your best to ignore the pained look Emet-Selch gives you as you turn away from him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Tears fall from your eyes as you meet the cool, smug gaze of Emet-Selch, the Exarch having been whisked away to Hydaelyn knows where."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “E-Emet-Selch...” you cough, white bile spilling from your mouth as your body convulses in pain."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Looking back on those memories of being able to create, of being able to bring things into being by just thinking about it, you had been tempted on multiple accounts to ask Emet-Selch to help you reach into those powers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You think to call out for Emet, but decide against it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They urge you to return home, ask after how your partner, the esteemed Emet-Selch is faring."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I have to find Emet-Selch.” You say slowly, watching as the shade seems to fret, blank eyes darting about."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your mind races malms a minute as you wait in the queue, wondering at what Emet is trying to show you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “H-Hades,” you cry, moaning as he groans against your sex, his lips glistening from his own efforts and your fluids."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “H-Hades...” You whine, finally able to open your eyes to meet his own, surprised to see affection in his stare rather than the usual smugness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades, wait,” You beg, but you feel tired."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After all, Emet-Selch is not around; that much you can sense."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Fruit in hand you stride over to the many shelves lining a wall, looking at the dusty tomes and you wonder if Emet-Selch leaves dust on them for aesthetics, or if they had sat here that long."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You jump futilely towards Emet-Selch’s outstretched hand, his arm raised as high as it’ll go as he holds the book high above your head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Do you mean me and Emet-Selch?” You ask, watching as he frantically shakes his head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At that moment a portal opens in the room, Emet-Selch stepping out looking less than pleased."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Before you can get a word in edgewise, both Emet-Selch and Hythlodaeus are gone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It has been well over a bell or two since Hades had disappeared with Hytholodaeus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You tell yourself not to worry, that surely Emet-Selch’s absolutely frigid look when he whisked himself away with Hythlodaeus’ shade meant nothing terrible."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Despite it looking exactly as it did in your memory, you, the mortal you, still cannot help but marvel at the sheer amount of aether it took Emet-Selch to recreate your home."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You wouldn’t say you ever feared for your life around Hades (at least not lately) or felt he would take advantage of you (he was a considerate lover after all) but the fact remained that you were still your own person, still the Warrior of Light."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Standing next to Emet-Selch, unsundered Ascian, the Architect, Paragon of Darkness-- You spin around at once, spotting Emet-Selch’s face of concern as he ambles his way toward you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The atmosphere almost seems to darken and you cannot figure out for the life of you why, when it’s just you and Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You...Hades...” You had no way of telling him that you doubted him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You have so many questions, but ever since that night of Hythlodaeus’ appearance, Hades has seen fit to not let you out of his sight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did you not come down here to protect your friends from your transformation into a sin eater?” Hades asks, arching a strong eyebrow from his place by the kitchen table."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Even when I was whole, I was the Traveler, Hades,” you begin, taking a steadying breath as you watch him frown."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades gives a bitter laugh himself, gazing at you from beneath is lashes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “H-Hades?” That your past life, that former you would give you some hint as to why Emet-Selch acts the way he does, why he’s so intent on making sure you never see the light of day again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I have taken note of him...the esteemed Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, my dearest Hades...it feels as if I have lived through a dream."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A fondness tickled the corners of your lips, threatening to quirk upwards with each declaration of love for your dearest Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades tells me if he could have his way, he would keep me tied down to his room-- He’s changed my Hades...I know he has."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The sky is naught but ash and brimstone and my Hades, the word is almost scribbled on the page, the ink blurred and blotched as if something wet had made the ink run."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You nearly jump out your skin, the diary flying from your lap and into the waiting hands of Emet-Selch who examines the text with scrutinous eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch frowns at that, arms hanging at his sides as he shifts into his usual slouch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It very well may be a waste of your time and effort, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “This is an action I cannot condone, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If nothing else, you will free her soul, Emet-Selch,” he murmured quietly, placing his hand on my shoulder again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I am Emet-Selch.” “I take my apology back,  Emet-Selch.” “Release her, Emet-Selch,” one of her companions threatened, the sounds of weapons being drawn ringing clear in the air."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I am Emet-Selch.” Emet-Selch disappeared in a cloud of black smoke before it could touch him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Alisaie gently put her hand on my arm again, her other reaching for the rapier at her side as Emet-Selch and I stared at each other in silence, my heartbeat pounding in my ears."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “This...Emet-Selch,” he began again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His biting words when he mentioned that Emet-Selch had touched me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You should be more concerned about Emet-Selch.” I huffed a laugh at his audacity, suddenly sitting straight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When we finally settled into bed, her back pressed against mine, I stared out into the darkness for a long while, imagining Emet-Selch in my bed once more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We are all members of a team here, Emet-Selch, not one more influential than the other,” her brother replied, matter-of-factly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You actively sought me out, Emet-Selch,” she muttered without breaking eye contact."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I released a long exhale, trying to calm the rapid beat of my heart as Emet-Selch walked through his portal and out of the Ocular."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “The longer it remains inside of you, the more uncomfortable it will become, no doubt,” the Exarch said, words nearly identical to Emet-Selch’s."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch was quiet for a long time, mind no doubt sifting through our previous conversations, realizing that my confidence was more than likely just a front."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I looked down to my side to find Emet-Selch kneeling on the floor next to my bed, head resting on his folded arms with his eyes closed, ungloved hand wrapped around my fingers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I paused, looking over my shoulder as Emet-Selch appeared, walking through our ranks to the front."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I  thought  we could simply admire the view together,” Emet-Selch began, amusement in his voice as his eyes slid to me, giving me a suggestive look that made heat rise to my cheeks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch bowed at the waist in compliance, silently following them deeper into the forest as we searched for Y’Shtola and the Night’s Blessed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Behind us, Emet-Selch sighed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The child must be the girl you spoke of before- Minfilia of the First.” She paused, eyes going between Emet-Selch and I."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We will make our way to the northeast- to a settlement in which the Night’s Blessed hath made their home.” She paused for a moment, eyeing Emet-Selch again as he crossed his arms over his chest, smugness radiating off of him as she examined him in silence."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I hung back until Emet-Selch finally made his way to me, looking somewhat annoyed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “There will be plenty of opportunities for us to speak in private, hero,” Emet-Selch insisted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Sometimes… I’m able to peek through that carefully placed mask of yours, Emet-Selch,” she whispered as she relaxed, leaning into my hand, placing her own on top of it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’m able to peek through that carefully placed mask of yours, Emet-Selch.” I placed my hand overtop his, pressing his palm flat against my cheek."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Was I also not guilty of omission, same as Emet-Selch?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" None of us saw Emet-Selch for quite some time while we went about slipping past the fanatical faction, though I was almost positive I caught him lounging in a tree, watching us with a quizzical expression as I destroyed beehives."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch cracked an eye open at the sound of my approach, but closed it again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So, Emet-Selch had spoke the truth, just as I thought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch was sitting up now, a steaming bowl in one hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What did you do to them?” Emet-Selch held his free hand up in surrender."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch merely shrugged."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I turned to find Emet-Selch heading towards the commotion, annoyance coating his features."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh, for the love of Zodiark,” Emet-Selch drawled, coming to a stop next to Y’shtola, who turned and took a step back, surprised by his sudden close proximity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch heaved a sigh and gave a dramatic shrug of his shoulders, one hand lifting in the air."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch raised his brow as they stood off, a small smirk appearing on his mouth as he snapped again, the vines tightening around the Eulmoran soldiers, their gasps and chokes audible as they struggled to breathe."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch placed his hands on his hips as he looked  down  at the man, condescension dripping from his voice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Because you favor the darkness,” Emet-Selch began, turning towards the Children of the Everlasting Dark."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Upon entering the room, Emet-Selch’s eyes immediately found the tablet we had brought with us."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Finally, Emet-Selch looked up from the piece of stone still lying on the table, his hand on his chin in thought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Is it?” Emet-Selch asked, standing straight again, hand going to his chin as he inspected Thancred from bottom to top."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch.” “Noted, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" However,  you may be reckless enough to present yourself without protective measures, Emet-Selch, but I will not be so nonchalant.” “This additional Light within her is blinding in its intensity, Emet-Selch,” he muttered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If there’s nothing else, Emet-Selch, there is much to be done.” “I found it strange from our first conversation, Emet-Selch, that you understood exactly how I felt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I was quiet most of the day, my mind stuck on Emet-Selch as we travelled the Greatwood, looking for the stone monuments to which we had to pay our respects."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Well, this is embarrassing,” Emet-Selch said as he came to a stop at the bottom of the stairs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Surely only a ruse.” Emet-Selch huffed an indignant laugh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh, very well,” Emet-Selch said with a click of his tongue."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Now, what color was her soul again?” Emet-Selch asked, more to himself than anyone else."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a sigh and one last glance to the ground where Emet-Selch had been standing, I nodded and jogged over to them to help Y’shtola."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You actively seduced me, Emet-Selch,” she muttered, releasing the sash to grip my chin and force me to look at her once more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And honestly… I’m a little mad at you, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When I woke in the morning, Emet-Selch’s arms were still around me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We-,” I started, turning to Emet-Selch as I began slipping back into my smallclothes, stopping short when I beheld the smirk on his lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Good morning, Emet-Selch,” I said, trying to keep my voice even as he straightened, then motioned towards one of the tables."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Gracing us with your presence today, are you, Ascian?” Thancred bit out as Emet-Selch slid into the seat across from me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I hadn’t even realized that the churning and thrashing had stopped, though I was hardly surprised, as close to Emet-Selch as I had been all night."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She turned her head to survey Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The remaining Darkness Emet-Selch had left inside of me fizzled out as if it were a fire doused with water and I could feel it now, the opening in my soul stretching further with the addition."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As if he had been summoned, Emet-Selch stepped out of his portal, taking slow steps toward us."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch looked at us each in turn, lifting a hand to his mouth in thought- as if he was judging us, deciding whether or not we were worth his time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Disappointment filled Emet-Selch’s face as he beheld me, something about my question making him struggle to keep his uncaring mask in place."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Without another word, Emet-Selch began walking away from us before disappearing in a cloud of purple smoke."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You always were far too sentimental, Emet-Selch.” “Would it help if he… if Emet-Selch were to infuse some of his Darkness?” Y’shtola asked then, her voice barely above a whisper as she finished brushing through the hero’s locks and began to fashion it once more in the same style she favored."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Coupled with Emet-Selch’s story, I can see why such a thing would fill your dreams.” When I lifted my head, I watched as Urianger looked up at Y’shtola, who came around again, stopping on Emet-Selch’s other side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I inhaled a breath through my nose and pursed my lips, eyes darting to Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I heard a hum and peered through my fingers as Emet-Selch stepped out of a miasma of purple and black."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-S-!” “Emet-Selch,” he greeted me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Her Constellation was never created, Emet-Selch, so an Ascension would do nothing for her memories."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “But I must take my leave, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “So Emet-Selch is… your title, then,” she breathed, though her train of thought was clear simply from the electricity of her tone, the excitement in her posture."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “So have there been other Emet-Selchs?”  Upon my movement, Emet-Selch quickly sat up next to me, his breath heavy and uneven."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch stilled behind me, his breath catching as I continued my description."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When I woke again, Emet-Selch was no longer in bed, and I felt his absence keenly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of course Thancred would, with his hot temper, make quick, rash decisions, especially when it had to do with Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It has your essence written all over it.” Emet-Selch furrowed his brow as he considered the pixie in front of him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I felt the  thrum  of power nearly vibrate the room and Feo Ul stopped short, their mouth snapping shut as they tilted their head in Emet-Selch’s direction, who was eyeing them with a certain murderous intent I had seen in only one other person before- his great-grandson."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That is what the  title  of Emet-Selch entails?”  “I take it you are not a fan?” Emet-Selch asked me as he took a seat on the corner of the desk."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I locked eyes with Emet-Selch’s, his expression grim as he knelt in front of me, examining my face carefully."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I forgot the drinks,” Emet-Selch’s voice said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch was at my side in a moment, gripping my chin and turning it towards him, inspecting me very carefully."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When I woke, the light was fading as night descended upon the Wood, and Emet-Selch was gone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “But, where is Emet-Selch?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But the fact remained that… no matter how hard he tried to distract me from it, it had never been far from my mind ever since Emet-Selch had revealed that it was  not  being absorbed properly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Do you think...Emet-Selch was telling the truth?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Both Emet-Selch and I seemed to have...autonomy, right?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “The Ascians have lied to me, manipulated me… And yet, when I look at Emet-Selch, I see something...different in him.”  Emet-Selch waved his hand in Thancred’s face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I tilted my head, watching Emet-Selch from the corner of my eye as he sat next to me, but did not bother to take anything to eat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The fork dropped from my hand, clattering to the floor as I wrenched my wrist out of Emet-Selch’s fingers and pressing the heels of both palms to my eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch,” the Warrior of Light admonished with her hand on my shoulder, her tone stern and reminiscent of that which she would use when I had overstepped."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If our friend has been having Echoes of this intensity, but seemingly only when in the presence of Emet-Selch, it requires our attention.” “Emet-Selch thought, perhaps, that the location was simply triggering too many memories.” “In which case, they could indeed be Emet-Selch’s memories she views."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch, in the Greatwood, you mentioned that Urianger and I could have been gifted with a similar power to yours  prior  to the Sundering.” “They are present when Emet-Selch is near her, thus they must be tied to him in some way.” “Perhaps Emet-Selch would like to be informed, as well.” “I see you were made aware of our little gathering today.” Emet-Selch hummed as he examined his surroundings."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I suspected from the beginning that you had a hand in its malfunction.” Emet-Selch chuckled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It is more important now than ever that we put forth all of our strength in finding the two that remain.” Out of the corner of my eye, I watched Emet-Selch cross his arms in front of him, though he remained silent for the time being."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh, I see,” Emet-Selch interjected, finally speaking up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch turned to me with a raised brow and shrugged his shoulders."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I glanced sidelong as Emet-Selch, crossing my arms over my chest as the others began filing out to prepare for the journey."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Much to my own personal dismay, Emet-Selch chose to continue his vigilance from the shadows, complaining of the over-abundance of Light."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There was a hum behind us and I peered over my shoulder to find Emet-Selch stepping out of a miasma of purple and black."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I am getting  old  .” Emet-Selch chuckled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A shame the rest of your  friends  have left, Emet-Selch.” Because... Emet-Selch is our ally.” “I am not, Emet-Selch,” he replied, calmer than I would have expected, given the circumstances."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You have ever been a champion for our cause, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It's not entirely unexpected, Emet-Selch,” he murmured."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Her heart and soul seek equilibrium, Emet-Selch,” he said, eyes trained on her when I peered up at him from my seat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a quiet whine in the back of my throat, I curled further into the warmth that had ensconced me before realizing it was Emet-Selch, his arms wound loosely around my body as he sat in the large, plush armchair I'd had brought into my inn room, holding me in his lap."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All of my friends had been of great help to me, though Emet-Selch never left my side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch chuckled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch hummed his confirmation, lifting his arm and flicking his wrist."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If you were to discover the Warden and she to absorb it...” His attention slid to Emet-Selch for a moment, who shook his head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I turned to Emet-Selch, who stood at the back of the room with his arms crossed, watching me closely."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s face flashed in my mind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I looked up and over my shoulder as Emet-Selch stepped through and into the room."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch...only spoke the truth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What brings you here, Emet-Selch?” he asked, his tone failing to veil the annoyance he felt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Then why waste your time with me, Emet-Selch?” “You don’t need to treat me like I’m a decrepit old woman, Emet-Selch,” she mumbled, looking down at her shirt to straighten it in an attempt to avert her gaze."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Could you do us a favor, Emet-Selch?” she asked, leaning back in her chair with a huff, her arms crossed over her chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Beneath all these things that you believe an Ascian  should  be, I think Emet-Selch is genuinely kind and caring.” Even when Emet-Selch’s breathing had evened out, I still laid awake, curled into his lap, my mind spinning and spinning and spinning."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s chest rose with a deep breath and I froze."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Thancred is back,” she informed me, locking her gaze with mine for a moment before tilting her head up towards Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Fine, are you?” Emet-Selch interjected with a scoff."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “No matter your distaste for Emet-Selch, you will  not  do this  now  .” He fell silent this time, though he stared at the conjurer with an intense look of resentment in his eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I had already been hearing the same sentiments from the Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If you won’t listen to me, hero,” Emet-Selch said softly from behind my chair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I don’t...I don’t  have  time, Emet-Selch.” Enough secrets.” My eyes shot to him as his narrowed in on Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch looked up at me again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If I may, I am also in agreement that there is more than meets the eye with regards to Emet-Selch.” “But I'll be watching you closely, Emet-Selch.” “This is my room, Emet-Selch,” she reminded me, her tone brazen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch?” “Emet-Selch answers to a higher power.” “Just… Please try to be careful, Emet-Selch.”  A moment later, Emet-Selch came through as well, landing above me with both hands on the bed on either side of my head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When I fell limp onto the bed, chest heaving as I gulped down air, Emet-Selch crawled back up to me, one of his hands sliding under my head, gently lifting it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When the room brightened, Emet-Selch stood before me in a long, dark robe, one hand clenched around the top corner of the desk as he stared down at his foot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Could you find these books for me, my love?” Emet-Selch asked from behind his desk, holding a piece of paper out to me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Before I was able to finish, Emet-Selch pressed his lips to mine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch turned back to me, his gaze scrutinizing every ilm of my body, pausing for a long moment on my chest- my soul- before sliding to the earring still lying on his nightstand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But, when I finally laid the long strands out side-by-side on a pan, the oven prepped and ready next to me, Emet-Selch stepped up behind me, wrapping his arms around my waist."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I realized it was done and looked over my shoulder to Emet-Selch, who was cleaning out the frying pan."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” I started, setting the plates down onto the table before heading to place them before our chairs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades, could you pull the bread out?” “Emet-Sel-” I pursed my lips as I made my way to my seat, Emet-Selch not far behind me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Won’t we, Ryne?” She glanced to Emet-Selch for half a moment, perplexion in her expression, before nodding shyly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When they broke out in more rigorous maneuvers, I declined, opting instead to go and sit under the tree Emet-Selch had decided to take up residency."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I stretched for a few more minutes until I felt it was sufficient, then sat on the ground with my back against the tree as I watched Ryne and Thancred dance around each other with weapons drawn, the sound of Emet-Selch’s pen once more scratching along the paper in my ears."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch took his seat directly next to me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I think not.” Emet-Selch sighed sharply through his nose and rolled his eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The gunbreaker’s jaw clenched for a moment as Emet-Selch’s smile widened, provoking him to open his mouth once more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I would not allow myself nor any of you walk into that city with hands bound.” Her eyes shot to Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A while later, Emet-Selch found me curled into the plush armchair by the window, staring up at the night sky, bathed and waiting for him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The morning we were set to leave, we gathered in the courtyard outside of the Crystal Tower and, true to his word, Emet-Selch opened up and stabilized a portal for all of us to travel through."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Behind us, Emet-Selch cleared his throat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And Emet-Selch-  “The Ascian could-,” his sister started once more, but he held his hand up to stop her, looking over her shoulder at Emet-Selch, who was...worse for wear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As the Scions began exiting the room, I came to a stop next to Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch seemed to be back to his normal self, smug smile included, as we approached Alphinaud and Chai-Nuzz, who were bent over one of the small tables."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Next to me, Emet-Selch faltered, his words coming to an abrupt halt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch breathed a laugh, straightening slightly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In a flash, the gunbreaker had closed the distance between us, his fist pummeling Emet-Selch square in the jaw."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Thancred,” Emet-Selch implored."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You will  let Emet-Selch through.” Her aether began to churn as she punctuated her every word."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Her heart and soul seek equilibrium, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Try as I might, Emet-Selch,” he murmured, lowering his hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And allow Emet-Selch time to rest.” As if in response, Emet-Selch’s arm tightened around my waist, holding me firmly to him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But…” He glanced over my shoulder again, eyes landing on Emet-Selch, still fast asleep."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Who are you talking to, hero?” Emet-Selch mumbled suddenly from next me, his voice still gruff from sleep."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch raised a brow as I huffed a laugh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To Emet-Selch’s considerable surprise,  I  suggested that we rest before going to Mt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch and I… he wanted to-”  Footsteps echoed in the eerie silence and I looked around until my eyes landed on  him  - Emet-Selch, as he was now, in his imperial garb."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Emet-Selch held his hand out to me, I took it readily, and he helped me into the large bathtub."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch,” I called."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch had placed himself on the couch behind me, gloves sitting on the arm, toying with the tail in my hair, as the Scions began streaming in after finishing dinner."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My gaze slid up to Emet-Selch to see his reaction."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But after a few moments, Emet-Selch breathed a laugh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It’s perfectly alright, my dear hero,” Emet-Selch assured me, tugging lightly on a lock of hair before shifting his attention back to my friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s hands paused in my hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And...in the way his soul seems less radiant than before.” Emet-Selch clicked his tongue, his irritation grinding against my soul."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch continued running his hands through my hair, the tips of his fingers rubbing against my scalp."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch began gently setting me down in the large bed in his room."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch pushed me hard, and I could tell it was so that he could push himself harder- to prepare himself fully for what was to come."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch threw himself into a chair as I moved to the head of the table and cleared my throat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We have to move on, Emet-Selch,” she said, sitting beside me and leaning in toward me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch,” she started again, though her tone was nervous, unsure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch?” “You said you would be  honest  with me, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch!” another Scion called, their voice muffled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You forget yourself, Emet-Selch,” he said, looking down at me from the corner of his eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Whatever the plan is, it’s clear he hasn’t deviated, or else Emet-Selch would be… he would…” “Look at her, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Silence descended upon the platform as Emet-Selch cast one last, heartbreaking look at me from over his shoulder and stepped through the portal after Elidibus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Something that….would cause Emet-Selch to-”  My chin trembled as I thought of how  hard  the poor girl must have been working to keep my soul together after Emet-Selch’s departure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-S-” The Light flared in my chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When I looked back up, I found Emet-Selch standing where the miqo’te had just been, his hand wrapped around a long-barreled gun as he frowned down at me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not without purpose, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “She cannot be freed from bonds she refuses to forsake, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “This is the solution I give you, Emet-Selch.” He released my shoulder, took a step back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What we have discussed will be difficult for you, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Really, Hades-”  When Emet-Selch had departed once more, taking the Exarch with him, Thancred pushed through the crowd of Scions as they were frozen in stunned silence, rushing to my bedside."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “He-Emet-Sech told me,” he started, leaning over to tuck a lock of hair behind my ear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We...take Emet-Selch up on his offer,” I said with finality."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But, Emet-Selch...”  A few nights later, as I settled into bed after a long day of planning rescue operations for the Exarch- going over different scenarios and possibilities, I felt a sense of calm wash over me, a feeling I had not experienced since Emet-Selch’ departure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They were receptive to going, if only because of my insistence, before we confronted Emet-Selch in the city."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What have you done with Emet-Selch?” I asked, my voice echoing around the room."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was...Emet-Selch?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" On my own, I did not  extract much information that Emet-Selch hadn’t told me himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I do not claim to know what the correct path is, Hades,” Hythlodaeus replied sadly as he placed a hand on my shoulder."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You were brought here at Emet-Selch’s behest, to tend to your wounds before you are reunited with the Warrior of Light.” “Hades, such volume of Light is not to be underestimated,” Hythlodaeus warned, understanding in his voice as he, too, came to realize my new plan."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I narrowed my eyes, looking straight ahead at Emet-Selch as he spat his vitriolic words, my hands clenching all the tighter around the hilt of my weapon."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch paused, faltering for a moment as his eyes slid to the space next to me, though I was sure he was still unable to see Warrior of the First."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “This was decidedly  not  how we wanted things to end, Emet-Selch!” They lifted their arms and, together, began streaming a similar light towards Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades…,” I whispered, the word rolling off my tongue so easily I felt...almost silly for not being able to remember it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” I said again, louder this time, placing my hands on either side of his face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I...came to once more request access to Emet-Selch’s office.” I wondered if the magic Emet-Selch had used on this room affected him as well as a part of this recreation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Mine...and Hades.” I slid my gaze back to him and he cocked his head to the side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And a book that...Hades conjured a few weeks ago.” Hades is...I-”  “Before...you fought him, Emet-Selch came to visit me in the infirmary,” G’raha started."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Between venturing out into the Empty and accompanying Y'shtola into the depths of the Ronkan ruins, many days I was successful in keeping Hades off of my mind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It is  teeming  with Emet-Selch’s dark aether, you know.” I glanced down at her hand as she held it out to me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It had been Hades’ parting wish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I come to offer you a proposition, Hades,” She started."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch had it all planned down to the last second,” he said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Among the memories Hades restored to me, was the final meeting in which… I stepped down from my post as Azem.” And since Hades was the sole contributor to mine…” And yet… upon Emet-Selch’s death, some of them seemed more willing to let us roam.” “Emet-Selch, too, sought another way."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Even now, Emet-Selch’s loyalty is astounding."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “My offer, Hades, still stands."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It may seem cruel to you, Hades, but even if Zodiark claimed her, I could raise another in her place."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades, you can’t,” she pleaded, the tears streaming down her cheeks and onto her armor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “How good of you to rejoin the realm of the living, Hades.” “I don’t think Hades would reabsorb  me.” “You’re in no position to be picky, Hades,” she said with exasperation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” I said, grinning as the twin’s eyes widened and her jaw dropped."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Malformed creatures, thrashing blindly about; the ghost of memory walks into Emet-Selch's present and haunts his every encounter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Regarding the use of Emet internally:  It's probably been a very, very long time since anyone has called him by Hades, long enough that Emet, in itself, is his identity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Emet-Selch is not a man to let potential lie if it might yet grow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Nor is Emet-Selch wont to let opportunity pass him by."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch cannot turn his eyes away, indulging an ephemeral dream that proves only just enough."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As ever, the Hero proves stubbornly unmoving; the man now known as Emet-Selch sighs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch and FemAmaurotineWoL welcome a new addition to their family."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With no singular concept embodying such ideal traits and with breeding long deemed unnecessary, it was quickly decided that Hades will create the unique addition to your family, one that might accompany you on the professional outings demanded by your position."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades' hand is warm yours, prepatory magicks welling in an anticipation his demeanor reveals naught of."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades tenses beside you and only too late do you realize your mistake."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The energies of Creation coalesce in Hades' hands."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades sighs deeply and rubs his forehead."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I thought our puppy might want a companion, but the issue seems to have resolved itself.” Resonation reveals Hades’ incredulity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was worried.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet calls Lahabrea \"old man\" in Japanese and, after the short story from SE, I'm convinced he got that from Hythlodaeus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That's a tiny tease to Emet in ShB."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch observes, remembering a friend long lost."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch closes his eyes, denying nostalgia its hold; a shattered mirror is doomed only to reflect twisted fragments of truth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch makes no attempt to stifle an irritable sigh as he observes his unwanted guests."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He’d sooner not have revealed himself, but having no other choice in the matter, Emet-Selch slides down from his perch, stretching lazily, ignoring the Drake's irritable snort."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch dispels the delusion, well past being haunted by ghosts residing within each fragment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch raises a hand, dismissing her with a stray wave, a gesture she returns with relief, tenseness leaving her shoulders as she motions her Drake forward under the canopy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch blinks at the intrusion; the Warrior of Darkness returns earlier than expected, continuing to run mortal errands."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lahabrea and AmaurotineWoL debate the candidates for the position of Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Featuring Hythlodaeus and Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lahabrea is sure his prize pupil, Hythlodaeus, will gain the seat of their retiring colleague, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 14th!WoL, however, remembers a young man in her classes by the name of Hades, & also greatly enjoys arguing with Lahabrea."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch requires a firmer hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" See you how the Third stares, lost within the Underworld, unable to distinguish between barriers?” It is as he says; the Third - Hades, by his given name - stares off into the distance, his back to you, each distracted nod emphasizing the Speaker's argument."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lahabrea’s is an unjustly harsh judgement; Hades' gifts reach beyond sight and to discard such observation as being lost is akin to dismissing a researcher for clearing their mind of distraction."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You'd been the target of a particularly intense bout of observation once, well before Hades was granted his place as Third; with the relentless tease of lifelong friends, Hythlodaeus had answered your queries on the matter in Hades’ stead, offering only evasive compliments on your teaching style."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Opposite Hythlodaeus in every way, Hades is broody and distant; it is only outside lecture that he rouses, preferring laboratory, where action replaces theory."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch has put his support behind Hythlodaeus and so shall I.” Does he truly believe Hades so ill fitting?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" From behind the huntress, with endearing sheepishness, Emet-Selch looks aside."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Long lashes loom heavily over tired eyelids; in a vulnerability so slight and fleeting that it might be gone in a breath, Emet-Selch’s shoulders slump further, posture settling deep into his robes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Vaguely visible and obscured by shadows from the corner of your eye, a smile plays at Emet-Selch’s lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch has no need for such tact."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What little good will Emet-Selch might have earned from restoring Y’shtola quickly wears its welcome away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch gives you pause, all but speaking your thoughts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet the mere thought of Emet-Selch with someone else – anyone – sets your blood ablaze."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So shallow is your reflexive half-truth that Emet-Selch shrugs in that gaudy, overt way of his."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch unfailingly meets you, knowing – understanding – with a tease that is no tease."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is not so omnipotent: A tiny blue flower, contrasting with the browns and greens of the wood, was missed while righting his attire, locked within the tiny ribbon on his lower back, just above his – \"Emet-Selch asked that I remember.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In an instant, heated blood freezes; hidden deeply in the protective shield of magic bound to your new attire is Emet-Selch's most precious stone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Far more overbearing than Hades' well-warranted grumbles is the stench that materializes at the aetheryte with your hastily assembled adventuring trio."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Well-warranted grumbles, indeed, but no matter your fumbling, Hades and Hythlodaeus remained, and their support is enough to keep a grimace from your features."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" From behind, Hades' frustration is easily and blessedly silenced by Hythlodaeus; Hades, above all, knows the value of having time for yourself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You fuss as much as Hades at times and others not nigh enough - an all too familiar internal voice teases, undeniably in truth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades would call you mad; even Hythlodaeus would shake his head at this venture and try to convince you to see reason."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Some might call you overprepared, but 'experienced' is preferable and using another overfamiliar magick - oh how Igeyorhm would fuss if she knew how many of its ilk you are privy to, Hades still worries about your every outing -  twining its balm with the fire, each tendril a salving lick over skin and muscle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And you are not one to deny such calls; perhaps, in the future, Hades might - It was enough trouble convincing a partner who enjoys the climate to come, let alone Emet-Selch - and you've a responsibility to your seat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He pauses with an exaggerated tilt of his head, before motioning to the surrounding chamber with a twirl, manner eccentric, and speech more theatrical than even Emet-Selch's antics."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Chapter Three:   Jealousy (Emet-Selch\/Azem\/Hythlodaeus) When Emet-Selch begins to notice that his two closest companions are spending more and more time together, he resolutely tells himself that he will remain unbothered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Chapter Six:   Dancing (Emet-Selch\/Azem, Thancred&WoL, Haurchefant\/WoL, Estinien&WoL, Alphinaud&WoL, Alisaie&WoL, Magnai&WoL, G’Raha\/WoL, multi.)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Chapter Ten:   Fever (Emet-Selch\/Azem) When a worried Emet-Selch finds out that it's because they've fallen ill, he takes it upon himself to take care of Azem, needing to be at their side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Chapter Thirteen: The Seat of Azem (Emet-Selch&Azem, Ancients&Azem, Emet-Selch\/Azem implied)  “In my journey to the first I met with Emet-Selch who told us of the ancients, the original peoples of this star who were sundered by Hydaelyn to prevent their downfall from Zodiark, splitting many of the ancients apart, Ardbert was the Warrior of Light form the first, he was another part of my original soul, the most recent seat of Azem on the convocation of the twelve, he joined his soul with mine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch gave me this,” they pulled out an orange stone from their pocket, the same shade as their eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Next up: Emet-Seclch is a busy man with much to do and much more to concern himself with, he doesn't have time to care that his two closest friends have begun to spend more time alone with one another."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" (Emet-Selch x WoL x Hythlodaeus) When Emet-Selch begins to notice that his two closest companions are spending more and more time together, he resolutely tells himself that he will remain unbothered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s two closest friends were close friends themselves, them thinking of one another and being around one another was nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The descent began in earnest after Emet-Selch had run into Azem, the other coming from who-knows-where, their arms wrapped around a basket filled with replica creatures, the likes of which could be seen all around Elpis."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Children’s toys.” Azem had explained when Emet-Selch asked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch had huffed and sent them on their way."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There was an unpleasant niggling in the back of his head, that petty and annoying feeling of being left out of something, but the truth of the matter is that even if Azem  had  come knocking at his door, begging with those luminous orange eyes and pouting lips that they  really really  needed his help, Emet-Selch was far too busy at the moment to spare any time or energy for such things at the moment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Azem had just nearly avoided censure, due in no small part to Elidibus’ efforts in campaigning for them, and Emet-Selch’s own advocacy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch had made sure to give them a sound scolding after the fact."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But in the meantime, Emet-Selch found himself wanting for company."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch thanked them and departed, hoping that he would still be there-- and there he was indeed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch felt an unfamiliar warmth in himself at the sight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Wasting no more energy on foolish thoughts, Emet-Selch quickly cut across the grass to the two."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ah, who has come to steal our sunlight than our dear Emet-Selch!” Azem greeted, blithely feeding another grape to Hythlodaeus who hummed in response."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It churned Emet-Selch’s stomach."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They held it up to Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Scowling, Emet-Selch snatched the grape from their hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Indeed, you know, when I passed up the seat of Emet-Selch I wasn’t expecting it to go to someone so  silly.”  Emet-Selch growled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You-” Emet-Selch began, only to be cut off when Azem leaned down and kissed the top of Hythlodaeus’ head, before tossing Emet-Selch the grapes and sprinting off, loudly reciting the oath they had taken when they accepted the seat of Azem."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch was reeling from the small kiss that he could barely form words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The third time it had happened, Emet-Selch had begun to suspect something."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was late in the evening when Emet-Selch had elected to pay an impromptu visit to Azem."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His flighty friend had made it known that they would be staying in Amarout for a time, and Emet-Selch had been surprised that his friend had yet to burst down his door seeking his companionship, as they were often want to do."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But even as prideful as he was, Emet-Selch was not one to deprive himself of Azem’s company when had the time, or when he wasn’t limiting their interaction as a form of chastisement."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The sound made flames erupt inside of Emet-Selch, hot and searing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades!” They exclaimed, the flush on their skin deepening."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch was well and truly struck dumb."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" From inside the apartment, Emet-Selch could see Hythlodaeus sprawled out, maskless,  on Azem’s couch, soft violet hair undone and disheveled, a matching flush on his face, around them on the floor were scattered pages, scrawled upon in ink, illustrations in various shapes and sizes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s breath hitched, too often deprived of Azem’s full visage."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch allowed himself to be pulled across the threshold, Azem shutting the door behind him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Wasting no time, Azem picked up one of the sheets of paper on the ground and presented it to Emet-Selch with a flourish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I have no idea what this means,” Emet-Selch said, dropping the paper."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Sharks, Emet-Selch,” Azem explained, bounding back over to the couch, throwing himself on it, and picking up a sketch that had managed to land on Hythlodaeus’ chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch wanted to pry them apart and sit in between them so they couldn’t touch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch scowled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s lip twitched."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Their caught Emet-Selchs gaze in a flash of amber."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I can’t even remember how Emet-Selch feels.”   “Excuse me?”  Emet-Selch asked, taking a step forward."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At those words, Emet-Selchs heart seemed to stop and stutter within his chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Azem over him, straddling his lap, arms looped around his neck, Hythlodaeus’ behind them, holding Azem’s torso, face buried in Emet-Selch’s shoulder."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus underneath him, Emet-Selch pinning him in place, Hythlodaeus’ head cushioned in Azem’s lap."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Annoying.”  Emet-Selch hissed, suddenly unable to keep looking."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch-!” Azem’s voice called after him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Azem had found Emet-Selch the next day, their hand catching his own, that endearing smile that begged his forgiveness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch sighed and restrained himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Whatever it was that Azem and Hythlodaeus were doing, they weren’t dragging Emet-Selch along, making a fool of him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Whatever they were doing, they would need to explain themselves and  apologize  before Emet-Selch would cave."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch frowned at him, not in the mood to deal with the speaker’s needling."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I fail to see how that is any of your business,” Emet-Selch replied, moving towards his seat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It set Emet-Selchs nerves on edge."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Their tone as they spoke carried some weight, a warning if Emet-Selch had ever heard one."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s jaw twitched."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Did your plans go awry?” That caused Emet-Selch to finally turn, looking at where Mitron had his hand on Azem’s shoulder with a concerned frown."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Mitron stiffened, his head suddenly looking to Emet-Selch from across the room."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch observed as Mitron was quietly apologizing to a clearly fuming Azem, Loghrif coming up and gently ushering her partner away with soothing words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Nabriales sat next to Emet-Selch and leaned into his personal space."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Things were looking remarkably well across the board, and Emet-Selch was looking forward to a relatively calm and relaxed amount of work."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You must have done a number on each other,” Igeyorhm commented, walking past Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hello, Emet-Selch.” He greeted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch was not  blushing  at that outlandish insinuation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As he watched the rest of the convocation depart, Emet-Selch was left with his thoughts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus was at his apartment and answered the door with a smile when Emet-Selch knocked, inviting him inside with a self-assured air about him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch watched the breeze rustle his hair, as it drifted about him like lavender petals in the breeze Beautiful."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selched dropped his tea."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch ached with how much he wanted that and was astounded that he was unable to identify his feelings until now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “To what end do you think, Hades?” Hythlodaeus asked, softly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You, my dear Emet-Selch, are wise in many ways, to many things, but I think the thing you may be the blindest to is how deeply you care about other people."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch swallowed around the lump in his throat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s eyes strayed to the thin garment that covered Azem, the long sleeves hung loose and flowing, almost gossamer in their silkiness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch.” Azem greeted, their voice hesitant."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch hatred the way it sounded on their lips in that tone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I now understand what you two were doing, but isn’t dressing that way a little  excessive?”  Emet-Selch asked, looking at their clothing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Powers preserve him, Emet-Selch was once again subjected to a myriad of visions again, Azem and Hythlodaeus both dressed in those gowns, wrapped in a tender embrace in the early morning sun."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And perhaps that’s what it did, as Emet-Selch didn’t remember reaching out to Hythlodaeus and pulling him up, and kissing him desperately."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch buried a hand in his hair and tugged on it, eliciting a soft moan."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Was that really so hard?” Hythlodaeus asked, planting his hands on Emet-Selch’s chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch raised his hand and snapped once, using his powers to transport Azem immediately to the two of them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Azem yelped and nearly retaliated with their own magic if the surge in their aether was anything to go by, but Emet-Selch didn’t give them the chance, grabbing them by the waist and pulling them into a kiss."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There was a muffled sound of shock, but afterward, Azem wasted no time in throwing their weight into the kiss, arms flung around Emet-Selch’s neck, kissing back with fervor, eclectic against him, nearly fevered with desire, hot against them, positively thrumming."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch grabbed their face and pulled back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You,” Emet-Selch said, before kissing him once more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch looked at Hythlodaeus, who stepped closer, wrapping his arms around the two of them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Against any and  all  better judgment,” Emet-Selch confessed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Azem buried their face in Emet-Selch’s chest, and Hythlodaeus gently kissed his lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They could clearly recall the warmth and affection on Hythlodaeus’ face when he spoke of his friend, Emet-Selchs begrudging but palpable fondness, Venat’s outspoken admiration and tenderness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The parts of this chapter are as follows:>Emet-Selch\/Azem, could also be read as Emet-Selch\/Azem\/Hythlodaeus>Thancred&WoL>Haurchefant\/WoL>Estinien&WoL, Alphinaud&WoL>Magnai&WoL>Alisae&WoL (Emet-Selch\/Azem, G'raha\/WoL crumbs)>Multi Among their number was one Emet-Selch, who had been stopped in his tracks on his way to attend to some important business."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For one reason or another, usually unwillingly (or so he tells himself) Azem possessed the unique ability to distract Emet-Selch from nearly anything."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They were dancing in the broad daylight, for no reason Emet-Selch could discern, but the joy and light surrounding them was nigh-palpable."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As Azem did a particularly elaborate twirl, a leap and a twist, landing on their pointed toes in a flawless arabesque, the crowd erupted into cheers, and Emet-Selch begrudgingly had to admit that it was a lovely move, highlighting just how much Azem must have practiced this dance, how light and quick on their feet they were."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Their dance continued on, and Emet-Selch couldn’t bear to tear his eyes away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They’ve been at it for a while.” Hythlodaeus said in lieu of a greeting, sliding up to Emet-Selch’s side naturally."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch scarcely needed to see the boy’s blue eyes to see that he was enthralled watching both the current and former seats of Azem’s dance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch coughed into his fist, abruptly flustered at the innocent comment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “While not what I expected to see en route to the Bureau of the Administrator, but not something that’s out of character for either of them.” Emet-Selch remarked, watching as Azem clapped their hands to the side before skipping slightly in a circle around Venat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The crowd gasped as their face was revealed, but Azem was unphased, catching Emet-Selch’s eyes from the crowd, their smile impossibly widening as they sent him a wink that caused his heart to thud painfully in his chest, as his face instinctually smiled back at them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Azem grinned as they stumbled up to Emet-Selch, Elidibus hurriedly dashing forward and offering up the waterskin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch watched their throat move as they swallowed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Azem’s attention turned to Hythlodaeus and Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Words rushed through Emet-Selch’s head, but none of them seemed accurate enough: beautiful, radiant, alive, vibrant,  enchanting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Isn’t that right, Emet-Selch?”  Azem tossed their head back, their laughter once again filling the air, filling Emet-Selch’s own heart."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Perhaps later on, Emet-Selch would tell them just how glorious they had looked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And one Emet-Selch, watching them with an indescribable ache inside of him, threatening to tear him apart at the seams as he watched a shallow replica, a washed-out, hollow mockery of the one he loved so dearly move in the shadow of their footsteps."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Next up: Azem's sick, and Emet-Selch is making it his problem."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" (Emet-Selch\/Azem) When a worried Emet-Selch finds out that it's because they've fallen ill, he takes it upon himself to take care of Azem, needing to be at their side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even Emet-Selch, close as he was to them, hadn’t the slightest idea where they could be."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When the meeting finally ended, Emet-Selch was the first out of his chair, ready to hunt down his missing friend and tear into them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Better if Emet-Selch got to them first."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch, wait a moment please!” Elidibus called, halting him in this tracks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch couldn’t deny the boy any measure of comfort that he could offer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch hated to crush it, but he deserved his honesty."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Thank you, Emet-Selch, I’ll look into it further.” You’re still here.” Emet-Selch turned, seeing Venat enter the room."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Yes, actually,” Venat said, and Emet-Selch immediately focused on her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “How sick are they?” Emet-Selch asked, cutting her off."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus gasped, and Emet-Selch felt his blood run cold."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Will they be okay?” Elidibus asked, echoing Emet-Selch’s own thoughts, far too preoccupied with the thought of Azem pushing themselves so hard to meet their obligations that they ended up collapsing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “No need,” Emet-Selch said before he could stop himself, resolved."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’ll relieve you of your duties.” Venat raised her eyebrows, and Emet-Selch’s hackles raised with them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Have you ever taken care of anyone sick before, Emet-Selch?”  “I hardly think it will come to that.” Emet-Selch waved her off, resuming his exit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hmm.” Emet-Selch dropped his hand back down, finally heading out, already running through what he would do to take care of Azem."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of course, Emet-Selch trusted Venat with Azem, the woman cared for their mutual friend deeply, but something within him rallied against the notion, wanting to be the one to see their recovery through, to be by their side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It suited them, Emet-Selch had always thought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch thought about where Azem could have gotten this illness from."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch stepped out into the hall and was met with the same quietness that was commonplace in the halls of most Amaurotine apartments."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As the door swung shut behind him, Emet-Selch sensed the weak force of Azem’s magic in the air moving it, though there was no sign of them as they entered the apartment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Decorative, but if Emet-Selch reached out and touched it, the small phantom butterfly would flitter around his fingers, and he would know it was Elidibus’ creation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All of it was intimately familiar to Emet-Selch, but there was a new blanket, thick-looking and adorned with geometric patterns in muted icy tones that lay in a heap in the middle of a loud rug."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" An Elpis flower pinned to the wall over their official invitation to join the convocation, a stuffed shark from Mitron fallen to the floor, a bouquet that Emet-Selch had given them, preserved in eternal bloom tied to their headboard."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch knew what Azem looked like in restful slumber, and this was far from it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though perhaps in response to the coolness of his hand, at his touch, Azem’s brow seemed to relax, and they turned into the sensation, making a dissatisfied sound as Emet-Selch drew away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch shushed them quietly, refreshing the water on the cloth and folding it, then resting it on their head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There was an empty glass next to the bowl, which Emet-Selch quickly stepped out to fill."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When the glass was full, Emet-Selch quickly turned off the tap, hurrying back to Azem’s room, to find them blinking awake, bright orange eyes barely peeking out from weakly fluttering lashes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It  is  Hades,” Azem muttered, a small smile breaking onto their face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Yes, it’s me.” Emet-Selch nodded."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Azem wiggled around in bed, and Emet-Selch stiffened, getting ready to hold them down if they thought about getting up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch slapped their hand away and removed it himself, raising his eyebrows, unimpressed at Azem’s behavior."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As they did so, Emet-Selch aided them with steadying hands on their shoulder, and he adjusted the pillows behind them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch chuckled as he picked it up, resting it on the edge of the bowl."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Venat informed us that you were ill, and I offered to return to you in her stead,” Emet-Selch informed, settling Azem back under their covers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Azem turned on their side, looking up at Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You don’t really seem like the type, Hades.” Emet-Selch crossed his arms, waiting on their explanation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I--” Emet-Selch sputtered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They reached out a hand and Emet-Selch took it, against his better judgment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It didn’t make Emet-Selch happy to hear, but it was true."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your floor, Azem.”  Emet-Selch held tightly to their had."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Letting all of his pent-up emotions out, Emet-Selch was mildly horrified at the degree of emotion slipping into his voice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “How  dare  you make me worry,” Emet-Selch whispered, helplessly bringing their hand to his lips, kissing it gently, refusing to acknowledge the hot tears threatening to spring from his eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch got the idea that Azem was expecting him to climb in next to them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch pictured it, an entire civilization beneath the sea, forgotten and unseen by the light of the sun."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch grabbed their hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The creatures down there, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I have no doubt you’ll make up for it,” Emet-Selch said affectionately."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch smiled as he watched them slip back under into slumber."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He watched them, their sleeping seeming far more stable at the moment, no doubt in small part due to the small amounts of healing magics Emet-Selch was channeling through them as they rested."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Blearily blinking awake, Emet-Selch’s senses slowly came into awareness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Immediately, Emet-Selch was painfully awake, and he hastily grabbed at a blanket and covered himself with it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Azem mumbled and burrowed closer into Emet-Selch’s side, still asleep."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" !”  Emet-Selch snapped, keeping his voice quiet despite his rising ire."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch sighed and glared at the other two."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You have a job.” Emet-Selch pointed out, attempting to recover some of his dignity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch huffed, and began to extract himself from Azem’s grasp."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch reached over and flicked his forehead."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There’s no need to frighten the boy twice.” Emet-Selch said as he departed the room, leaving Venat and Hythlodaeus chuckling softly as he left."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch was well aware of just how much he looked up to both he and Azem as fellow members of the convocation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch shook his head and set about tidying a space on the kitchen counter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch raised an eyebrow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Please, stop talking,” Emet-Selch begged, rubbing at his eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Venat nodded and left the room, passing Emet-Selch and Hythlodaeus as they walked to Azem’s bedside once more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With every word they spoke, Emet-Selch felt his temper rise and rise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus had a considerate look on his face, opening his mouth to no doubt chime in on this inane conversation when Emet-Selch decided that enough was enough."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Halmarut is a wonderful nap partner, but I fear that any further discussion about this might just make Emet-Selch weep.”  “You-!” Emet-Selch felt a profound rush of embarrassed indignation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Don’t weep, Emet-Selch, come here.” Azem opened their arms."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch debated with himself about returning to them, but the discussion from earlier about sleeping with Lahabrea propelled him forward into them, enveloping them and holding them close."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch resented how light he felt at that confession, how the words caused a sudden fluttering feeling in his heart and stomach."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch closed his eyes, holding his fevered love to his chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s eyes hadn’t strayed from them for all of the meeting, wanting nothing more than to break formation and be at their side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Out of the corner of his eye, Emet-Selch could see Fandaniel’s shoulders slump, curling into himself, “I know the cost is great, but-”  There was nothing more that Emet-Selch wanted to do than cross this circle, to take Azem into his arms and reassure them, to quell the storm that was raging through their veins, to reassure them that everything would be fine, that things would be  fine  like they had done so often for himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch couldn't hold his tongue anymore."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch knew them well enough to know that it was not out of placation, but of rage."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We’ll get nowhere bickering about this,” Hades said, eager himself to extract himself from this meeting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch paled as he mentally cataloged who among them possessed the most aetheric power."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Fandaniel’s hand rose, it was not unexpected, but felt like a headfirst plunge into an icy lake, as Emet-Selch was faced with the possibility that this could be it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch watched as Loghrif gently grabbed Mitron’s hand, and raised her other, the shaking arm of her beloved following soon after."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch couldn’t tell how much time had passed, nobody moving an inch, before Elidibus raised his hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch saw his lip tremble."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Feeling numb, cold, hot, feeling everything and nothing, an overwhelming sorrow, a  hatred  for these final days, their helplessness, their folly, their last hope, Emet-Selch raised his hand, eyes fixed on Azem."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The clatter it made echoed in the room, and through Emet-Selch’s very soul."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And Emet-Selch could only stand, frozen, as his friend left, taking his heart and leaving nothing but a gaping hold in his chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch listened and tried desperately to convince himself that they had made the right choice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch wouldn’t allow himself to even think otherwise for a moment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch left the meeting with shaking hands."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch leaned up against the side of a ruined building, and slipped his mask off, rubbing at his eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus would have stopped by, written his name on Emet-Selch’s face in ink, and put a blanket around his shoulders."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Half of us, Hades,” Azem whispered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,  he’s just a boy!” Azem looked around, perhaps hoping their desperate glancing could conjure him from thin air."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch pulled them closer, holding them to him as if he could simply expand and absorb them inside of himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades…” they muttered, and his heart broke with each syllable."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” they strained against him, and everything within him rallied against it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades!”  They pushed some of their aether into him, and he dropped them and hissed in pain."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He wouldn't have changed it for the world, before, but now, as the reflection of a burning Amarot turned their already bright eyes into a blaze, Hades wanted nothing more than to douse that fire, if it meant keeping them here, safe and in reach."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Stop playing the hero!”  Emet-Selch nearly screamed, throwing his hand back in frustration."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Something hardened in their gaze, and Emet-Selch knew that something had changed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What was left of Emet-Selch’s heart shattered to nothing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They turned on their heel, and Emet-Selch practically stumbled forward, calling their name."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “My Hades,” they said, sorrow and affection at one in their tone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had asked anyone who might know."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus, who their mutual friend never failed to come to, even with matters hidden from Emet-Selch, had heard nothing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch was left alone, with naught but his faith in Zodiark to guide him, which he clung onto with a fierceness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I like tormenting Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They thought of Emet-Selch, and clenched their eyes tight as they snapped their fingers, the memories of Zenos forefront and crystalized in their mind’s eye."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You may call me Emet-Selch,” it finally comes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I must admit, it is rather amusing watching you scramble your little mortal brain to come up with a better explanation,”  the voice, no, Emet-Selch, interrupts her thoughts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I wouldn’t be,”  Emet-Selch replies, and his voice echoing through the cave is audibly annoyed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Tell me, who risked their neck, their life even, to go against all rules and teach you this discipline?”  Emet-Selch asks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Whoever this Emet-Selch is, he appears to be both powerful and decidedly unhappy about whatever she had done to this place."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You won’t find any,”  comes Emet-Selch’s reply.\r\n\tBut Emet-Selch doesn’t sound wrathful.\r\n\t“Of course not,”  Emet-Selch says, amusement swinging in every word.\r\n\tThe stone has secrets to teach her, and if he isn’t lying to her, so has Emet-Selch.\r\n\tThere is no indication Emet-Selch is there, and when she calls out his name, the only answer she gets is more silence.\r\n\tEmet-Selch sounds incredibly put out, his voice echoing loudly through the cavern.\r\n\t“The audacity,”  Emet-Selch murmurs with a disbelieving huff.\r\n\tEmet-Selch’s voice is demanding, making it clear he expects no more backtalk, and as tempted as Irene is, she did come here to learn after all.\r\n\tBut the moment she starts to cast her first blizzard, Emet-Selch interrupts her.\r\n\t“I didn’t ‘give up,’ my mana is almost depleted,” Irene argues, but Emet-Selch is not having it.\r\n\t“Yes, just like that,”  Emet-Selch murmurs encouragingly.\r\n\t“How are you supposed to gain anything if you’re not willing to give everything?”  Emet-Selch asks as she lets her staff sink and gasps for breath.\r\n\tEmet-Selch’s voice is harsh, cutting straight through all the haze of exhaustion.\r\n\tEmet-Selch has her repeat that circle over and over until that last bit of pushing through becomes easier with every try.\r\n\t“What kind of name is Emet-Selch?” Irene asks when her breath finally evens out.\r\n\t“So you’re not really Nald’thal - he doesn’t exist, and Emet-Selch is a title…” Irene muses before she shuffles until she can twist her head and look at the statue.\r\n\t“You know I am not in there, right?”  Emet-Selch asks, again with this patronizing tone that grates her.\r\n\t“It is of no consequence for you,”  Emet-Selch says simply, and when she tries to ask once more, he simply talks over her.\r\n\tShe should probably have expected it, but she is somewhat startled when Emet-Selch straightup laughs at her.\r\n\t“Ah, do I hear the frustrations of someone who has to meet said expectations and doesn’t want to?”  Emet-Selch asks, still in an amused voice.\r\n\tI certainly wouldn’t do what everyone else wanted me to,” she says with a sigh that seems to spark Emet-Selch’s interest.\r\n\t“How utterly ordinary,”  Emet-Selch sneers, and even though he doesn't sound particularly kind at that, it manages to pull Irene away from feeling too sorry for herself.\r\n\t“Oh, you delight in being rude, don’t you?”  Emet-Selch says, annoyance back in his voice.\r\n\tShe still doesn’t have a firm grasp of who or what Emet-Selch actually is, but he is taking the time to teach her something new.\r\n\tAnd to her surprise, Emet-Selch is vaguely accommodating of her more erratic schedule.\r\n\tAt her flippant answer, Emet-Selch lets out an amused chuckle.\r\n\tEmet-Selch lets out a dark laugh, disdain and condescension practically dripping from his voice.\r\n\tEmet-Selch sounds so derogatory, so disparaging towards people that she wants to rush to their defense, but at the same time, she knows that at least some of what he said holds a kernel of truth.\r\n\t“As you are right now, it is,”  Emet-Selch says, sounding more leveled again.\r\n\tHer supper is taken absentmindedly as she goes over her talk with Emet-Selch again and again.\r\n\tFor the first time ever, the prospect of losing her relative freedom seems eerily close, and thoughts of what she might still be able to do and what parts of her life would inevitably be over manage to banish Emet-Selch from her mind for now.\r\n\tEmet-Selch doesn’t sound kind when he tells her to stop casting in the middle of a complex array of spells.\r\n\tIt doesn’t feel as strange as she would have expected, the thought of telling Emet-Selch about this.\r\n\t“Such things can be pursued at any time, my dear,”  Emet-Selch points out with a small scoff.\r\n\tShe thinks that if she would have a face to go with Emet-Selch’s words, his lips would curl in distaste with the way his voice sounds.\r\n\t“You are afraid,”  Emet-Selch concludes, for once sounding fairly neutral and not filled with judgment.\r\n\t“It suits you well,”  Emet-Selch confirms with another chuckle before his voice suddenly turns more serious.\r\n\t“How very charming of you,”  comes Emet-Selchs bone-dry reply.\r\n\t“You shouldn’t assume anything, my dear,”  Emet-Selch finally says, and while he doesn’t sound angry, there is something in his voice that feels undeniably tense.\r\n\tEmet-Selch lets out a laugh.\r\n\tIt seems that Emet-Selch has decidedly different thoughts on the matter.\r\n\t“How archaic and utterly boring,”  Emet-Selch scoffs at that moment.\r\n\t“Not that I am aware of,”  comes Emet-Selch’s dry answer.\r\n\t“Well then,”  Emet-Selch says with a small sigh, and his voice seems suddenly closer somehow, almost as if someone were speaking right next to her.\r\n\tIrene finally gets out, voice scratchy from the sudden dryness in her throat as she hastily goes over everything she had said in her mind again, trying to determine if she at any point sounded like she was asking Emet-Selch for help with this.\r\n\tAh, there it is again,\"  Emet-Selch interrupts her with something that sounds almost like impatience."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My dear, I've been around since before the lot of you invented the calendar to mark the passage of time,  Emet-Selch replies with a scoff."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You shouldn't,  Emet-Selch agrees."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And you are intrigued,  Emet-Selch muses, calling her evasiveness out for what it truly is."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Irene asks, with a worried look towards the entrance of the cave, and Emet-Selch lets out a soft laugh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That, my dear, depends on what exactly you want my help with,  Emet-Selch says with a terribly inviting tone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Usually not for this purpose, but it works just as well,  Emet-Selch explains."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You will be rewarded for it,  Emet-Selch promises, and the lure in his voice makes the decision for her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I am graciously helping you out, my dear, think of it as a small reward for my efforts,  Emet-Selch's voice comes low from right next to her ear again, and despite the warmth around her, a shiver runs down her back at the thought that he wants to see her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Now, all you need to do is let yourself be led,  Emet-Selch whispers the moment she is finished, and like before, she feels that strange compulsion to move again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Emet-Selch speaks again, his voice feels like a warm breeze running teasingly across her whole body."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Open up for me, dear,  Emet-Selch encourages her, tapping her thigh lightly with her own hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch clearly wants her to go along with him on her own to a degree, and Irene bites her lips as she looks down her body with bated breath before following suit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Go on, my dear,  Emet-Selch murmurs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch says in a low voice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ah, patience, my dear,  Emet-Selch chides her softly, and just like that, she no longer has control over her hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch, please, I was so close… Emet-Selch's voice is but a growl in her ears, and Irene doesn't hesitate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With Emet-Selch's voice rumbling low in her ears, she shakes from release as she shouts out her pleasure, tightly wrapped around his name."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Well done, murmurs Emet-Selch's voice in her ear, and Irene feels another shiver run through her that has nothing to do with the temperature at his words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You're very welcome,  Emet-Selch murmurs, seemingly perfectly content with not getting a more elaborate answer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Irene is about to leave the cave when Emet-Selch's voice suddenly echoes through the air again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It pays off when Emet-Selch sounds demanding in a way that makes her throat feel dry at his next words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At night in her home, when Irene can't sleep because her thoughts keep circling back around Emet-Selch, she catches herself thinking that she wouldn't mind a repetition, wondering if he would think similarly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Maybe she would discover more about herself that she might show Emet-Selch the next time… before she remembers just how unable she was to keep her voice down."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Back to the cave, to Emet-Selch's voice, even with all its condescension."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ah, you are finally awake, I see, and already messing with aether again,”  comes Emet-Selch’s slightly disapproving voice from somewhere out of the dark around her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You can find me even when I am not at the shrine?” she asks the first thing that goes through her mind, and Emet-Selch lets out a scoff."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I told you to stop, but did you listen?”  Emet-Selch says, clearly displeased, before he adds,  “You could have easily killed yourself with what you did!” “That worked out marvelously for you then, my dear,”  Emet-Selch comments, and it almost feels like there is a hint of cruelty hiding behind his dry tone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I would have helped you,”  comes Emet-Selch’s equally harsh answer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I didn’t even know you were there,” she claims, trying to push the thoughts away, but Emet-Selch doesn’t let her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You did just that, my dear, and in the process… well.”  Emet-Selch sounds a little less angry than before, but there is still an unusual distance in his voice as he continues,  “There were some healers in here with you who did their very best, I assume."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “So it wasn’t anger the second time then, but fear?”  Emet-Selch muses before his voice turns stern."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Perhaps,”  Emet-Selch says thoughtfully."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’m accused of murder, aren’t I?” she asks nonetheless, and when Emet-Selch affirms it, Irene feels like there is something stuck in her throat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I have to, do I?”  Emet-Selch interrupts her, sounding almost a little amused."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Something that Emet-Selch notices instantly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch doesn’t answer, and for a brief moment, Irene fears that he simply left."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Again, quiet spreads for a while before she can hear Emet-Selch’s voice once more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I swear I can do better than this,” Irene tries to appeal to him, but it seems like a waste of her breath when Emet-Selch sighs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the moments of her greatest pain, she calls out to Emet-Selch, but he either doesn’t hear her, or he is indeed content to watch her suffer in silence."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Just as she remembers what Emet-Selch had said about her having attacked the healers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her mind goes back to her last talk with Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch had told her to be bold, after all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I hurt people that tried to help me,” Irene murmurs as she remembers what Emet-Selch had told her in the cell."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She vividly remembers the sense of relief that had run through her when she had first talked to Emet-Selch, and he had more or less confirmed her doubts about the Twelve."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Something around her shifts, and for a brief moment, Irene feels like she is back in Thanalan, where the warm breeze over her skin gets replaced by chilling cold as she trains and listens to Emet-Selch's lectures."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For a moment, Irene could swear she feels Emet-Selch's presence all around her, keeping both the fire and the dread at bay."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A surge of lust goes through Irene at the thought of how much she had enjoyed the idea of Emet-Selch watching her back then."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She doesn't even know if Emet-Selch would still answer her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That Solus would use the exact same words as Emet-Selch had spoken to her in the cave when teaching her magic - coincidence seems the only valid explanation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Like that moment in the Burn where Irene could have sworn she had felt Emet-Selch's cooling touch for a moment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And that ‘somewhere else’ had been in a cave in Thanalan, talking to Emet-Selch, who is, by his own admission, immortal."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Some immensely powerful, immortal being that seems to have its fun playing games with her, Irene realizes as she thinks back to her last talk with Emet-Selch in the prison cell in Ul'dah."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her head has trouble combining the images she has of Emet-Selch with her experiences with Solus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And even way before that, back in the cave as Emet-Selch, he had told her to be bold."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch and Solus van Galvus are one and the same person - and he had spent the last few months lying to her about almost everything."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I  will  have answers from you, Solus, or Emet-Selch, or whatever you prefer!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Question the most eminent Emet-Selch?\r\n\tOh, look at that, your wife doesn't sound like she approves, oh most esteemed Emet-Selch.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, she whispers, and he is undone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades' grip on her tightens with insistence and a low moan, and Irene smiles again, reaching for his face and cupping his cheek."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades' eyes flutter shut for a moment as he leans into her touch and takes in a deep breath."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Another tear rolls down the side of her face at the pure emotion behind the simple words, but when Hades opens his eyes again, there is something in them that makes Irene freeze."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It's not right, Hades says softly as he gently wipes more of her tears away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch has learned to avoid it as best as he can."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is, by all means, used to indescribable loss."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When she tells him she's expecting once more, the small ray of hope quietly rears its head, and once again, Emet-Selch lets himself think 'maybe.'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch detests it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Squished like a bug under the enormous presence of an unsundered, complete soul, the person that had been born as Solus had ceased to exist the moment Emet-Selch had taken over."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Time moves ever forward, but Emet-Selch refuses to acknowledge it as he longs to go back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Every day, like clockwork, he has taken it upon himself to appear and ask for an end to this charade, but Emet-Selch says nothing in return."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sometimes Emet-Selch wonders if the other hadn't drawn the better lot after all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch doubts he could even answer this question."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch remembers marrying her, watching her fall in love with him all over again; he remembers their fights and their joys and their children…  After a while, Emet-Selch had let his senses wander."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch had always known she didn't agree with some decisions he made."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch, Elidibus starts once again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch can do nothing but scoff."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch has a date with death and his long-awaited rest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For those of you who mentioned you do not play FFXIV, but still want to read this (wow), it might help to know that Solus Galvus\/Emet-Selch can do many things with his magical powers, including fly, shapeshift and change the way his body appears, create both grand illusions and small physical objects, and teleport using an in-between dimension of shadows."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Now why would Emet-Selch be so strangely angry and betrayed at this mortal girl that he would want to marry her just to punish her?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had told her of a mission the Emissary was to be leaving on soon and she had all but ran through all of Amaurot to track him down, wanting desperately to help him aid the neighboring villages she called her home away from home."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He was still an adult of course, one older than herself, Hythlodaeus, and even Hades by a small margin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was an unlikely friendship and one Hades hadn’t approved of until much later on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And to hopefully be at peace and find it within himself to let go of his guilt and despair...just as she prays Hades has."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Just as Hades had."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch, her beloved Hades who had promised to always remain by her side and kept true to his word even when she couldn’t remember him or his promise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And I’m sorry to you most of all, my beloved Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If she could have just saved Hades, then maybe at the very least he could have found happiness again with her by his side… Is this what Hades would do when he slept between his mortal lives?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This all happened because I couldn't stop thinking about how upsetting it is we had to kill Hades and Elidibus both (granted it had to be done under the circumstances I'm just butthurt because I really liked these two lol)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle won't remember everything in them, of course, but she'll reference them every now and again and Hades might as well so for anyone who does read those, it'll be like little easter eggs I guess ^^ (and Elidibus has some rly cute oneshots and so do Laha and Iggy and just ;-; I love the Ascians too much lul) Hades had suffered far more than she."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And so, regardless of what happens to her, she will find a way to save Hades from Zodiark's grasp and still halt the Eighth Umbral Calamity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stood there in his arrogant and nonchalant manner just as he did when he first made himself known to her and her friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Hades had said that knowledge is a burden, she hadn’t quite understood what he meant until just now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’ smile turned upwards just a little more at that while he shrugged."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I am Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’ smile turned into one she almost would have mistaken to be genuine as he turned and lifted his arms up to the darkening evening sky."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle consciously dug her nails into the backs of her hands as she held them firmly against the tops of her thighs, trying to keep her inner turmoil from showing too much while Hades continued."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Tears welled up in the corners of her eyes and for a fleeting moment, a look of confusion flashed across Hades' face while Aestelle struggled to keep her composure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And to have Hades of all people being the one so angry, it hurts more than anything she could have imagined."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Crickets chirped in the distance while Hades’ face returned to its neutral albeit tired expression."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yes, she cried out desperately to have this second chance and save her beloved Hades, but now that she’s here, she can’t take seeing him like this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I will not raise a hand to hinder your hunt for the Lightwardens.” Hades continued, brows twitching somewhat as he doubtlessly noticed the pain she’s trying to mask."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades shifted his gaze to the young boy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" See beyond the unscrupulous villains you take us for.” And again Hades’ smile fell as he looked down at her in earnest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No memories of her past life in Amaurot were needed for her to just have this gut feeling that told her this Ascian by the name of Emet-Selch was not her true enemy, that there may really be an alternate path for them to walk down together where no more death need come to pass."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Rejoining could not and will not happen, but must it truly be stopped at the cost of Hades’ life..?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle’s eyes widened when Urianger launched a card right for Hades’, his glamour fading into a cloud of inky black and deep purple aether just like that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stood there and looked on at her with an unreadable expression, a small wry smile dancing across his lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not saying a word, she could only watch as Hades’ spared her one last look before turning around, one he never spared her before."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There’s no telling if maybe she’ll wake up as if this was all some cruel, twisted dream, or if she’ll still end up failing in the end and Hades’ death by her hands is simply a fixed point in time that she just cannot alter despite trying her damndest to."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was much the same before the Final Days too; no one place being hers, that is until she met Hythlodaeus and Hades and later Elidibus who cemented her roots in Amaurot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch already gotten to you, has he?” She recounts her history with the Convocation, of the crystals Hades, Lahabrea, and Elidibus had made following the Great Sundering, tells him about how just like him during his own time, she won."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After all of that, I killed Elidibus only to somehow end up back here when we first met Hades─I mean Emet-Selch...oh never mind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It doesn’t matter if I call him Hades with you.” She said with a dejected laugh at remembering all the times she stumbled over calling him by his real name when speaking with the Convocation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Shepherd to the stars in the dark.” She repeated Hades’ own words that he had secretly imbued into the crystal he made for herself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Then what does saving Emet-Selch have to do with anything?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You already killed Lahabrea, so that means Emet-Selch is next."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If that Emet-Selch character and you really were lovers way back in the day, then he wouldn’t want you to die for him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To say Hades is terrible at making friends is an understatement and Aestelle doesn't know what she's going to do with him once all is said and done."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The reality that she can fail yet again is so very real still and where she could say before she had no choice but to do the things she did, now that she’s in possession of a portion of her memories, she can’t use her ignorance as her defense and excuse should she have to kill Hades a second time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had entrusted her with their fate...and if he believed in her even after the Great Sundering, then she has to at least try to prove him right in placing his faith in her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Looking past Thancred and Urianger, Aestelle took a few more steps to stand between the two men as Hades turned and looked at her with a small smile, one she couldn’t help but smile softly back at."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Looking from her to her comrades who regard him with nothing but cold skepticism, Hades sighed and shook his head with an added hand on his hip."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I come only to observe.” Though when Emet smirks to himself and steals a glance back towards G’raha, she resists the urge to shake her head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades raised his hand in a shrug while a wry smile tugged on his lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the small moment of silence that Hades left waiting for a response from one of them, Aestelle found herself taking a step forward towards him before she could even stop herself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I like that idea.” She said, shocking her friends and Hades and even herself to some degree."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Have you already forgotten who your enemies are,  hero?” Hades asked as if he himself didn’t just suggest this very allyship."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I loath to say it, but Emet-Selch is right."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her smile faltered before it fell altogether, glancing from Hades and then to Alphinaud."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I for one will place my trust in Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades smiled at that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With their conversation concerning Hades more or less coming to a close on that note, G’raha took it upon himself to start discussing the sin eaters with them all, Aestelle getting caught up in her thoughts as she more or less tunes out of the conversation she can still remember for the most part."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It’s just, she knew that her friends would never trust the Ascians, but she was still hoping that maybe by her openly saying she wishes to place her trust in Hades then at least they’d be open to the consideration of doing the same."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There’s no way they’ll simply trust Hades because she says she does."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It’s not like Hades and the others don’t deserve the hatred of her fractured friends and the rest of those living on these different stars."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A few of them asked her for her impression of Hades which proved far more difficult to answer considering she needs to hide their past, something she doesn’t know for how long she’ll even be able to hide."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The aether shifts and suddenly dark teleportation magicks whirl to life, Hades stepping out from the rift but leaving his portal open, not intending to stay long."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “A useful talent.” Hades continued despite her lack of a response, gaze inquisitive as he judges her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a slight frown, Hades shook his head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’ll be seeing you around soon, Emet.” Though this time as she walked to meet back up with them, she could sense Hades’ presence more clearly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Had Hades kept such a close eye on her before and she simply failed to notice him?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though she can’t help but wonder if Hades can feel the link as well, or if because he doesn’t know who she is yet there isn’t a link to be felt on his end."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After her victory over Hades, however, she stopped scrying her fate and hasn’t done so since."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Also can someone explain to me why I'm unlucky enough to get only Hades and Elidibus' trials when I queue for my trial roulette this past week?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The first time they came here to Rak'tika, Hades was less than impressed with Y'shtola's welcome."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The sudden shift in the aether behind them instantly caught Aestelle’s attention, no sound coming from his teleportation magicks this time around as Hades exits the rift."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It didn’t exactly help that Hades walked past them all without so much as acknowledging their presence, arms outstretched and held up towards the sky."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A sudden pang of nostalgia for those halcyon days.” Hades then said with a more somber lilt to his voice before taking on that emperor act once more, walking forward a few steps and lifting a hand to the air."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle muffled a laugh with the back of her hand, Hades’ hand falling once more as he turns to look at the hyur with a bored countenance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades wasn’t as smug and arrogant back then, but oh how he did love when he was right and that much hasn’t changed from what she can tell."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Both Thancred and Hades looked on at the girl in shock for a moment, and then the Ascian was raising his hands and giving her a halfhearted shrug."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I am an observer─nothing more.” Hades responded with an awkward smile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Placing a hand to his chest, Hades bowed with that self-same smirk he so regularly wears and she couldn’t help but smile a little herself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She wants nothing more than to reach out to Hades as well, but she needs to wait until she’s devised a plan on how to save him from their cruel fate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Much as he had before, Hades remained quiet while he and her walked side by side at the back of their small group."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It wasn’t uncommon in those final few days before her fight with the Emissary to find her wandering around Hades’ phantom Amaurot and just trying to relive her memories as best she could."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her aether reaches out to him one more time, her gaze shifting off to the side and away from Hades to pretend she didn’t notice what her aether is doing against her will."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And yet Hades knew who she was and still chose to fight for their lost home...so does that mean even if she confirmed his suspicions and told him for certain she was his lover from when the world was whole, he would still choose to try and kill her and her comrades?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was telling the truth when he said his heart's sole desire is to bring about the Rejoining."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades has to understand that the souls of the sacrificed belong to Zodiark and the fractured beings they once called their friends will never be as they used to should they be made whole again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If only Hades, Lahabrea, and Elidibus had thought as much after the Great Sundering."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Why can’t Hades look past their faults and see all the wonderful things they’re capable of despite their frailty in comparison to the Ancients?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle glanced to her side only to find Hades already looking at her almost expectantly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even Hades knew better than to stubbornly do his own thing, raising his hands along with them and exhaling an exasperated sigh under his breath while he flicks his attention from her to the armed men and women now surrounding them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of the two of them, Hythlodaeus had often been the one to accompany and aid her on her random mini-adventures throughout their fair city while, more times than not, Hades was either the victim of her pranks or simply collateral damage when she might have gotten caught by Lahabrea and Halmarut on more than one occasion while sneaking into the deeper parts of Akadaemia Anyder."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was just about as rare for Hades to humor her childlike games as it was for Elidibus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle glanced to Hades at the sound of his voice that had taken on an annoyed lilt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was always some arbitrary bet as well, something Hades would doubtlessly come out on top in so he couldn’t refuse."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Night’s Blessed looked to where Hades was previously standing with nothing short of fear and shock."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was just here, for a moment at least."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He just finished through 2.0 so now he's onto all the fun between then and Heavensward while my other friend is about halfway through 2.0 and won't stop calling Y'shtola \"Y'shitalot\" :'))) I also showed this particular friend a picture of Emet since I figured just a picture won't be spoilers and I don't ever shut up about him so the least I can do is show a picture- and I really shouldn't have because my friend proceeded to say \"is that a marble in his head?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But if you’re truly wanting to befriend the others, Emet, then you might do better actually showing yourself every now and again instead of hiding in the shadows all the time.” Hades spoke from no discernable direction, and he was clearly still somewhere in the rift judging by the persistent shift of the aether all around her now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades retreated into the rift, the disturbances in the aether growing further and further away while she ventured deeper into the dimly lit cave."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So many died─and she doubts Hades would want to hold any sort of service for those who were sundered─but it feels wrong not honoring their past somehow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades has taken on an impossible burden to carry alone and yet she’s positive he has never once complained."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades is nowhere near now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She’s failing miserably at not drawing suspicion just as Hades is failing at truly befriending her companions."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How Hades has made it this long is beyond her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But not until she’s saved her beloved Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Just as Hades shoulders his burden, so too shall she."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Before she was forced to fight Hades, she took one final reading into her own fate and it was Halone who was placed upright at the top of the Dawn Cross, foretelling of her inevitable victory over the second Unsundered she would have confronted in battle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And they’d offer her company when all she wanted was to return home to Hades and their friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “May Halone watch over my friends, Hades, and myself…” She murmured under her breath as she started down the same path her friends had taken mere minutes ago, leaving the Darker behind to meet up with them all in Y’shtola’s room."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle agrees to accompany Hades to the Chrysalis, though it seems he had more in mind than to simply ask a few questions."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Honestly, if she could just confide in her friends and ask them to help her find a way to detemper Hades then she would probably be a lot less stressed over her current ordeal."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stood right in front of her, peering around the tree to look on at the general and the others surrounding him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had never shown himself before he went to save Y’shtola from the Lifestream after they revealed the path leading into the Qitana Ravel so what is he doing here now?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Since they first arrived in Rak’tika, Hades had clung to the shadows so she didn’t need to worry too much about her unchecked aether."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Shifting his gaze to her once more, Hades shrugged."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “From your perspective, I guess it’s only fair for you to view my actions as such what with your innate inability to conceive of the nature of our universe.” Hades scoffed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Exhaling a soft sigh as the conversation between Y’shtola and Ran’jit continued on behind the large tree, Hades shifted his weight from one heel to the other."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Well unlike yourself, I can easily teleport away to the safety of the rift with as little effort as a snap of my fingers.” Hades said with his usual complacent cadence."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And it would be even worse should her friends catch her speaking alone with Hades out in the open like they are right now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Urianger is already suspicious of her, and Hades is telling the truth when he says he won’t hurt her, so what can go wrong?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If you truly trust me then come along.” Hades said while he turned around, his smirk evident in his voice alone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The portal welcomed her, gently carrying her along the currents of aether to wherever Hades has chosen for them to talk."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It wouldn’t do for Hades to make an enemy out of her while he still intends to use her in his grand scheme to once again plunge the First into the blinding Light."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Unlike Fandaniel who was stubbornly trying to get close to her at every given opportunity, Nabriales took the approach of using her to further his work instead which Hades and Elidibus and even Lahabrea and Igeyorhm all took issue with─but not her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’ve been here once before if I’m not mistaken.” Hades’ voice snapped her from her reverie, his footsteps echoing out into the void from behind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades crossed his arms over his chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You’re  sorry?” Hades asked incredulously."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades remained quiet as he simply stared at her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And if Hades wants to blame her for it all as well, she wouldn’t hold it against him because she blames herself for this mess too."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They meant the world to her and Hades so it’s only fair if he decides to beat her down with his words over all the hell she has wrought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “The recounts Lahabrea had given of your attitude towards him and Igeyorhm made it sound as if you were the true unscrupulous villain between us and yourself.” Hades spoke up once more, his expression unreadable."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It shouldn’t have taken me this long to finally take matters into my own hands and think for myself... I’m sorry.” She forced herself to look at Hades despite her heavy heart."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You truly have no desire to kill me even after all the terrible atrocities you and yours insist my brethren and I have committed…” Hades said as he placed a hand to his chin and closed his eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades narrowed his eyes slightly at her while he once again crossed his arms over his chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Here,” Hades paused as he held out his hands with his palms face up, “place your hands in mine.” “Now close your eyes.” Hades instructed, waiting for her eyes to close before doing the same."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She remembers the first time they met, and Hades had said and done this exact thing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus insisted they work together to create a bird through complex creation magicks she had never so much as attempted before while Hades was more than adept in and so, the only possible way for them to create something together on such a grand scale was through the attunement of their aether."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’ soul is still intact so his aether is unimaginably thick and dense giving her no fighting chance to truly attune to him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It’s been so cold and lonely without Hades being a constant in her life after she regained a portion of her memories, most of which pertaining to their past relationship."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Taking a step back from her, Hades dropped their hands while his aether retreated completely as does her own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Raising his hand above his head, Hades snapped his fingers and a portal opened to their right."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades,  her  Hades, knows who she is."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ever since she regained a portion of her memories, all she had been dreaming of between the hellish nightmares was to one day be reunited with Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If it wasn’t for Hythlodaeus giving her the Convocations crystals and her being able to hear Hades say that the fate of their home was now her own, she wouldn’t have had the strength to set their Emissary free from his duty."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It had always been Hades who kept her going when everything felt insurmountable."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She’s had her fill of heroes and villains and just wants to return to being the Traveler she used to be with Hades by her side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Thank you…” Aestelle whispered barely loud enough for even her to hear, her hands pressing hard into her chest as if to hold the parts of Hades he had relinquished to her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" though it quickly became muddled and just a mess of ideas and the whole concept was rushed after about twenty chapters so i decided to go a different and much simpler route where now Aestelle only has to worry about saving Hades :3 who knows maybe one day I'll write an au where those three are still alive and being the buttmunches they are but that day is definitely not today xD) When her nightmares are of Hades in the ruins of Amaurot, well, it’s not even much of a fight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus was the person she was closest to most after Hythlodaeus and Hades...and she truly loved him as she did them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He was always there for her when she needed another opinion on something she knew Hades and Hythlodaeus would be biased towards."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus said that she had Hades and the other Convocation members to rely on by then."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It must be Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She still doesn’t quite understand why Hades would give a part of himself to her so readily after they’ve only just met in this timeline."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her thoughts soon drifted to Hades as they so regularly do."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That’s something she’s been wondering since Hades told her in the Ocular that the Unsundered have the power to raise up fragments of their lost brethren’s souls into their respective offices."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If she has to kill Hades again, then he’ll be the same as Lahabrea; gone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There is no way to replace Emet-Selch, no fragments of his soul for he was never fragmented to begin with."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And if there has been no progress in detempering the followers of the lesser primals, then how is she supposed to rescue Hades from Zodiark’s grasp when He’s one of the two oldest primals in existence?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If they knew she wanted to instead detemper Hades and not kill him, then they’d ask questions."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But thinking about Y’shtola reminds her of what the miqo’te woman had said following her battle with Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “As a disciple of Zodiark, the Ascian was the Darkness to your Light…” It was during her fight with Hades that she was forced to use the Light of the Lightwardens to make Ardberts axe into a physical weapon so she could land that final, decisive blow that ultimately resulted in her beloved’s death."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She has to fight Hades in order to rid herself of the Light that will soon threaten to consume her, that goes without saying."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But if there’s a way to use the Light instead of wielding it like a weapon, there might actually be a way to rid herself of the Light and save Hades without having to ask her scholarly friends for their input."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To use the Light to save Hades… That’s kind of ironic and she can’t help but laugh under her breath."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By that reasoning then she would be able to feel if she was beginning to give in to Hydaelyn’s wishes which she obviously isn’t if she’s trying to manipulate Her blessing of Light into saving Hades rather than killing him… But at least she’ll get to see Hades again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades needs to save Y’shtola from the Lifestream and there’s no getting around this if there’s any hope in helping him gain the favor of her friends... He’s no different from her or Hades in that regard."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades is going to show up once they’ve gotten the antidote into the hands of the Night’s Blessed and then he’ll save her from the Lifestream, successfully gaining at least a smidge of trust from her friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had one thing right when he spoke to them all back in the Ocular; possessing knowledge is truly a burden… And to think him and the other Ascians have lived with their knowledge for eons now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle’s gaze shifted past the red-headed Viis and to her two sisters who were walking a very guilty-looking Hades down the stairs into the sleepaway commons."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades took a few more steps forward before stopping."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What an intriguing turn of events.” Hades said with a somber lilt to his words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades shrugged as he looked right back at him with a conflicted expression."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet another strained silence fell around them as Thancred continued to glare daggers at Hades who looked every bit unfazed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades relaxed ever so slightly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh...very well.” Hades said, sparing her a glance before looking to the rest of her party."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “As I’ve said before and I’ll say again, I trust Emet and will gladly accept his help─especially now when we have no other options.” She said honestly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Glancing over her shoulder, she offered Hades just a ghost of a smile, his eyes widening a fraction in response."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Leaving Fanow behind, Aestelle took her time in making it to the spot she knows Hades’ lamp will inevitably lead her to."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I'm having a blast writing this story lul it's so much fun writing for Hades :3 can't wait till Elidibus makes his first appearances and all hell breaks loose lmaoooo Also my goal of buying the night pegasus mount is only looking more and more bleak everytime I check the market board again and find that the price is *somehow increasing* ;-; at least I have my Hades statue in my apartment to cry in front of while I watch the one mount I really want slip from my grasp xD It's because of Hades that Y'shtola is saved from the Lifestream, so why do her friends still glare at him so harshly?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Waiting at the designated location, Aestelle couldn’t help but glance around while she waited for her friends and Hades to arrive."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If it wasn’t for Hythlodaeus and Hades and Elidibus and even the stars to offer her their comforting words and wisdom, she doesn’t know how she ever would have been able to continue on in life back then."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They’re more likely to try and say Hades has somehow used his magic to put her under a spell of sorts, implanting false memories into her head so he could manipulate her or some other nonsense Alphinaud is likely to conjure up in that boundless imagination of his."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then they wouldn’t ever trust Hades and would most probably disregard anything she tries to tell them as well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The crunching of twigs dragged her from her thoughts, her eyes opening once more as she turns to look at her friends, Hades leading their group towards her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stopped no more than a few paces in front of her, tearing his eyes from her own to look around the surrounding area while flecks of gold continued to gently rain down all around them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With his eyes upturned to the open air, Hades looked first to the left, then to the right."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She remembers being just as speechless when Hades had first shown her this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And so, after much childish whining and name-calling and even half-heartedly hitting him, Hades caved in and finally agreed to show her just a sliver of what he and Hythlodaeus have always been able to see through their clear soulsight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades and Hythlodaeus on the other hand could see with surprising clarity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ah… There you are.” Hades said, stopping his hand and pointing at a single twinkling soul."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades might tell himself later on that he’s only doing this for his own benefit, but she knows him better than to believe such false words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Raising his hand high above his head and snapping his fingers once more, Hades clothed Y’shtola and the light all around her vanished along with the image of the souls he had created for them to see."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You don’t intend to run to her side as well?” Hades asked while he looked down at her, arms crossed over his broad chest once more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Much how Hades had once picked her up when she’d return from a particularly long adventure… “No amount of words could express how thankful I am for this, but thank you anyways.” Staring down at her for a second longer, Hades shook his head before clearing his throat while he directed his attention to her comrades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Everyone turned to look on at Hades, Thancred most of all finding annoyance with his constant presence while he scowls at the Ascian."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch, the Ascian of whom I spoke.” Urianger explained to the miqo’te woman."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Y’shtola looked on at Hades with an indifferent expression."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades only shrugged in response as Y’shtola’s bright white eyes traveled down to the young girl standing beside him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Dost thou have unfinished business with Emet-Selch..?” He asked, casting the Ascian standing beside her a wary glance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Y’shtola isn’t liable to wait and if we take too long, well, you know how likely it is we’ll find her inside the Qitana Ravel within the hour.” He said without taking his cold stare away from Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet just saved  Y’shtola."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With his eyes narrowing even further, Thancred reluctantly turned away from Hades and scoffed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades uncrossed his arms from over his chest while he looked on at the pair walking back down the path of azure flowers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “From what I’ve gathered, it was either you killed him or he killed you.” Hades responded with an added sigh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades shrugged."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Then give me the truth.” Hades said as he took a step towards her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All this time she’s been so caught up with avoiding making her friends too suspicious of her that she neglected to truly reflect on how her actions would come across to Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Another long stride and Hades was now no more than a fulm in front of her, barely any space left between them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A loud bang resounded and suddenly a bullet was flying past Hades’ head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet wasn’t doing anything wrong!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I promise so  please  put away your gunblade.” She said, holding her hands up in some vain attempt to shield Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Allies,” Hades spoke up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Teleportation magicks whirled and consumed Hades in a matter of seconds, the portal into the rift closing just as quickly as it had opened."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even if a mere bullet wouldn’t be enough to truly kill or really hurt Hades, the thought of him being shot makes her sick to her stomach."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet just wanted to talk is all.” Aestelle responded softly, her pained expression only deepening as Thancred’s hold on her wrist tightens to the point she swears she can feel her bones shifting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet only wanted to talk, I promise so please let me go.” She tried again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle could only sigh under her breath while the aether shifted once more and Hades retreated further into the rift."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How is she ever going to get Hades and her friends to see eye to eye on anything when this is how they act towards one another..?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Everything feels so long ago after she nearly lost herself to her grief when she remembered all that Hades had asked her to."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was still there, of course, just as it was before her battle with Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He’s been suspicious of her right along with Thancred since the moment Hades showed up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So many painful memories of this tumultuous time in their history came flooding back to her following her battle with Hades; All of the fights she had not only with the Convocation but with even Hythlodaeus before the Final days were truly upon them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Never having the chance to say goodbye to her family or most importantly to her beloved Hades as suddenly the world was fracturing at her feet, everything going dark before she woke up on a ship set sail for Limsa Lominsa."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Footsteps rung out into the large space from across the platform, her attention fixed on Hades as he walked up to stand opposite of their group."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was obvious to hear in his voice alone how annoyed he was at having to see Hades yet again, especially after the terrible end to their last encounter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades seemed to find that just as amusing as she did, his smile upturning slightly into a mischievous grin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Until one calamitous day when the world was divided across ten and three reflections, sundering the land and all who dwelled upon it.” Hades paused as his eyes fell to Aestelle once more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “A vision shared of a paradise lost, preserved only in song and scripture and paint…” Hades continued, no traces of his usual arrogant emperor facade to be found as he regarded the murals with a dejected and almost defeated expression."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At least Hades believes what he’s doing is right and has never lost sight of his mission and goal or his conviction."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We are listening.” Y’shtola said, looking on at Hades with slightly narrowed eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Placing a hand to his chin and closing his eyes for a moment, Hades paused as he thought of how best to deliver their history to her friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades pointed on to the third mural, not bothering with a response."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Or…?” Hades looked to her and when their eyes met, he understood instantly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades didn’t say this was their history or that he and the other Ascians were behind Zodiark’s summoning yet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Our story.” Hades confirmed with a troubled expression, flicking his eyes between her friends before settling on her yet again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sparing her one last sorrowful look, Hades turned around."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades never said that when he first told them of their history."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With all of their thoughts weighing heavily on their conscience, their small party of five started off in the direction Hades had left in."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades is a wonderful smol bab and the Scions are 10000000% onto Aestelle being sus xD After Hades told them of their history, and she very nearly sold herself out for being Azem, the atmosphere around their small party has been strained to say the least."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thancred has yet to speak to her since Hades left them in the Qitana Ravel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of course the Ascians and Zodiark will forever be in the wrong, but if Hades’ recount of their history holds any kernel of truth, then what would that make them in regards to their unyielding devotion to Hydaelyn?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She knows Hades is telling the truth since she can remember talk of Hydaelyn’s summoning from back when the world was whole."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It only makes sense that Venat would have continued on with their plan to shackle Zodiark and with Hydaelyn being the survivor of the Great Sundering between the two primals, Hades’ depiction of those final years just confirms what she had assumed happened in those last few fleeting moments when the ground beneath her feet began to crack."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She couldn’t save her and Hades’ home from the Final Days...but they don’t know that so they continue to believe in her because she’s the Warrior of Light."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That gunbreaker friend of yours doesn’t seem happy with you and Emet.” Ardbert pointed out while he pushed himself from off the wall to take a seat beside her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet, I mean."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades told the truth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And, as Hades already said, they fought until ultimately Hydaelyn won, fracturing all of existence with only three surviving the Great Sundering.” “So Emet really is telling the truth, just not the whole truth then."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I understand why Hades and the others wanted to bring them back, and Zodiarks’ tempering only made the desire far more impossible to ignore, but I could never condone the intentional loss of life on such a grand scale for a third time to come."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It doesn’t sound like Emet-Selch or the other Ascians will ever truly stop at trying to finish what they started and if you don’t intend to help them, then you have no choice but to kill them.” “Hades is  not  a monster.” “Emet isn’t your lover."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He’s still in there─my Hades is still in there─and nothing you or anyone else says will change my mind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I don’t think Hades wanted me to lose to him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades has always been a champion of Zodiark’s will, but even he knew that their dream is a hollow one at best."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And Hades and I will see that our legacy will never be forgotten."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Besides, I think I have a plan on how to save Hades from this cruel fate of ours.” And so, I’m going to use my Light to save Hades from his Darkness.” And, with your help, I was hoping maybe you’d be willing to offer me your strength in using this Light not as a true weapon to kill Hades, but to rather cast out the Darkness that has taken root in him since Zodiark’s summoning.” “You’re so lucky I’m the only one who can see and hear you because Hades would have tried to kill you if he ever heard you say something as preposterous as that.” She giggled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And the final Lightwarden we take on before traveling to Hades' phantom Amaurot…” Her voice grew softer, focusing on what she needs to write to the Exarch in favor of thinking on what the future may or may not hold for her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Any idea how you’ll manage to explain and somehow convince them to go along with your nonsensical plan to save Emet-Selch and agree to just spare the life of an Ascian?” They won’t believe anything Hades says about our home until they see it with their own eyes so trying to explain to them our connected past will only cause further suspicion."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I just, all I want is for them to welcome Hades into our ranks and for him to agree to help us in protecting life as we know it today."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If it came down to it, either protecting Hades and losing my friends or joining my friends and killing Hades, I don’t know which I’d choose."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To have Hades by my side again and not worry about the Ascian threat for another minute is all I could ever dream of… But,” Aestelle paused as she lifted her head and looked to her ghostly companion, “that’s not very heroic of me, is it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You won’t let the Light consume the First even if it means having to kill Emet so it’s not as if you’re forsaking your duty entirely."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was only about a week after she had first returned to the Source having defeated Hades and she wanted─no,  needed a distraction, and so she looked to her friends at the Athenaeum Astrologicum in Ishgard."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Why is this the price everyone must pay for her selfish wish to save Hades being granted?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’ve gotten yourself into quite the mess now haven’t you?” Emet asked as he knelt down beside her to get a better look at Alisaie."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’m asking for help, Emet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Why do you risk your life for these frail mortals?” Emet asked, the two of them working together now to help heal the younger girl who still lied unconscious at their feet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I…” Aestelle paused, her muscles finally relaxing as Hades’ aether soothes out over her petite frame and continued to heal her from the inside out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not even you, Emet.” Emet here helped in healing your sister and myself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Slowly standing up, Hades brushed down the front of his emperor regalia and looked to her friends with a bored expression, shrugging as he does so."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That we do.” Urianger agreed, staring at Hades with clear skepticism."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’ smirk only widened."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-” Hades didn’t allow her time to respond, opening a portal and retreating into the rift after saying his peace on the matter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I know you all care for my well-being and Emet is just a little bitter is all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With every step she took, her heart managed to grow heavier in her chest despite the small amount of Hades’ aether that lied deep within trying to offer her some sort of warmth to comfort her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though ultimately it was Hades who was the first to realize that the task they had placed upon her was simply too great."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All she ever wanted was for her and Hades and Hythlodaeus and Elidibus and all of their friends to be happy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I have to pay the price for attempting to save Hades so I will gladly take all that fate throws at me in exchange for being given this chance to rescue him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It’s about the same as the false reassurances Hades had spoken about her comrades giving her when they’re unable to truly help in her trials."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But if it’s at the cost of Alisaie and the others that Hades will be shown mercy, she isn’t so sure how ready she is to continue walking down this path with them sticking so close to her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ever since Emet-Selch made his appearance, you have been so very unlike your usual self."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After losing the first real family she ever had...it hurts too much to even entertain the idea that the Scions might be next in line to die in exchange for Hades being spared."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, Hythlodaeus, and all of their friends and family made Amaurot her home, not the city itself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades rolled his eyes from behind his blood red mask as he crossed his arms over his broad chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “But you’ll still like me even if I’m a ghoul, won’t you my beloved Hades?” So I get to call you my beloved Hades for just a little while longer.~”  Chuckling, Hythlodaeus patted Hades’ shoulder."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades exhaled an exasperated sigh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Good.” Hades scoffed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I couldn’t hear her from way up here.” Hades said with a smirk, knowing full well his height is one of the few things he has over her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “My beloved Hades, how I hate it when you’re right.” Though she may live in this fractured life now, she never wants to simply let go of the original life that shaped her into who she and Hades are today."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" (and you'll all be happy to know Emet's in it ayyeeeee) The Exarch would speak with them all in the Ocular prior to their departure for Amh Araeng and Hades is determined to make everyone hate him, much to Aestelle's dismay."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You know, you’re welcome to come tag along Emet.” She said softly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle couldn’t help but laugh, instantly feeling better at simply having Hades near again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades rolled his eyes but nevertheless followed along beside her, their steps lining up perfectly as they continue up the long staircases leading to the Ocular."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sorry to say it Emet, but I think you’re stuck with us now and forevermore!” She very nearly sang as she walked with a newfound skip in her step."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades narrowed his eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This only had Hades pinching the bridge of his nose while he furrowed his brows."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Thanks to your motherly care in the infirmary I’m only a little sore and that’s about it.” She then glanced around Aestelle towards Hades who stood off to the side, shoulders slouched while he met her gaze with an unreadable expression of his own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ascian or not, Emet does have a heart you know.” She giggled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A fact I discovered when he attempted to use it on me.” G’raha recounted, surprising most everyone in the room with the only exceptions being herself and Hades who long since already knew this truth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And of course it was now when the tension in the Ocular had grown nigh suffocating that Hades decided to speak up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Which is why your heart is ready to burst out of your chest.” Hades mused, obviously ignoring her every attempt to get him to stop instigating further discourse between those two."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Now why would that be?” While Thancred’s hand balled up into a fist, Aestelle could only watch as Hades’ lips quirked up into just a ghost of a smirk at having finally figured her gunbreaker friend out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though he did bother sparing Hades a parting glare, one to which the Ascian simply smirked even larger at in response."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If she manages to save Hades, she doesn’t have the faintest idea how she is ever going to get them to play nice with one another."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades finds far too much amusement in poking fun at Thancred and Thancred makes it far too easy for Hades to get under his skin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle was just about to make her exit as well and have a few choice words with Hades when the Exarch spoke up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With an exasperated roll of his eyes, Hades turned and left the Ocular without putting up a fight, much to her surprise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Looking back to her friend once Hades was gone and she was sure he wasn’t lurking somewhere unseen, Aestelle flashed him a bright smile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If they knew of her true intentions─to save Hades above all else─then surely they’d do everything within their power to separate them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her friends hate Hades, Thancred most of all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Should it be known that her love for him might very well prevent her from truly being able to kill him if it came down to that, then they might double their efforts to push Hades into a corner where he has no choice but to defend himself against them and if that happened, Aestelle would have to protect her friends even if it meant losing him… So that leaves her with one option."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She’s picking up Hades’ bad habits it seems and getting far better at lying than what she’s comfortable with."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “To put it plainly, the sudden power surge─or so to speak─that you’ve exhibited since Emet-Selch’s arrival has to do with your memories.” The miqo’te man cut her off with a knowing smile, one that made her blood run cold at being found out so easily."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But has he been watching her encounters with Hades?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Mayhaps it has to do with your newly budding relationship with Emet-Selch that has caught the attention of not only myself, but of everyone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Finally, the topic shifting to Hades is something she can actually defend herself against."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Is me trusting Emet really so bad?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades really is a terrible influence on her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They’re suspicious of her and Hades after all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades' deep voice snapped her from her thoughts, the older man pushing off the crystalline wall he was leaning against to approach her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I am more than capable of looking after myself, Emet.” “Don’t tell me Emet, are you  jealous  of me taking the time to talk with the Exarch?” Giggling, Aestelle happily started back down the stairs with Hades by her side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades and her continued their high-spirited banter all the way down to the bottom of the Crystal Tower."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Songs for Hades:- Lovers Death by Ursine Vulpine, Annaca- Beautiful Crime by Tamer- Without You by Ursine Vulpine, Annaca- Innocence by Nathan Wagner (goes for both him and Aestelle tbh)- autumn breeze (london) by Jida, Rachel Lim- Sin Circus by Unlike Pluto It’s the mere idea that when she saves Hades, she’ll lose the Scions in exchange that shakes her to her core above nearly all else."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And that’s to speak nothing of how their opinions of her will change when they realize her true goal has been to save Hades─their enemy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After everything the Ascians have done, Aestelle doesn’t blame her friends one bit for not wanting to necessarily give Hades a chance...but it hurts seeing those she cares for so openly hate the man she loves."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Saving Hades comes second only to saving the First and the Source and she will not risk the Scions getting hurt because of her wanting to save her beloved."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Something on your mind, Minfilia?” She asked sweetly despite the heartache evident in her chest that even Hades’ aether struggled to truly soothe."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle spared him an acknowledging glance but remained quiet, not wanting to draw any further suspicion from the two men who have been wary of her since Hades’ introduction on their merry little adventure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But she will not allow the Scions to fall with her or try and take matters into their own hands by hurting Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She has yet to scry her own fate since her triumph over Hades and the thought of seeing the inversed Spear atop her Dawn Cross sends a chill down her spine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Tensions have just been a little high since Emet showed up is all, but that’ll end soon."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was difficult seeing as it was oftentimes Igeyorhm who she would run to for advice when things with Hades would hit a rough patch every now and again and she needed a woman’s perspective on things."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Once she saves Hades and hopefully even Elidibus, then she can set off to work fixing the Ascian’s image and once again claiming their roles as stewards of now a multitude of stars."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Fate, if this is your way of making me pay for giving me the opportunity to save Hades, you’re cruel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I know what I’m doing doesn’t make sense and, I need you to trust me on this when I say you can trust Emet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I have a reason for befriending Emet and I’ll explain everything to you and the others when the time is right."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lest you forget that the Ascians are our enemies─Emet-Selch himself being at the top of that list with his constant presence in our affairs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet is my…” What is Hades to her and what is she to him?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “My friend.” Aestelle managed to say, the word ‘friend’ sounding so wrong on her tongue where Hades is concerned."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Besides, we have more important issues right now than what Emet is doing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Just because we’re having a normal conversation again doesn’t mean I approve of you getting close to Emet-Selch.” It was special to her and Hades, the first thing they had ever created together and their most celebrated creation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And once they’re in the Eulmoran’s domain, Aestelle will have no time at all to look for a way to save Hades before both he and herself are whisked off to the Tempest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Also oooooooo things are starting to take a turn away from the canon storyline now ayeeee it only took seventeen chapters for something kinda-sorta big to happen apart from Alisaie getting bopped by a sin eater xD I need to find more excuses to write in Ascian Echo flashbacks because I feel like the new things Aestelle could see will only have her more torn deciding if she should stick with the Scions or run off with Hades (because, let's be real, she totally would run away with him if she could lmao) Okay, tiny sidenote, so I've been thinking far too much about how things are going to be REALLY different with Elidibus when he finally decides to join this hell and just :'))) part of me is dying to speedrun this fic to the good parts with Elidibus and the other part of me is like \"Hades is literally RIGHT THERE like chill holy hell\" lmaooo The songs \"Beautiful Crime\" by Tamer and \"Nobody\" by Faith Marie are actually the theme songs for this entire fic for Hades and Elidibus I swear xD Aestelle doesn't expect him to come, but Hades has always known when she needs him most to comfort her─even if neither of them can say it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And she doesn’t even want to imagine how terrible Hades’ recreation of the Final Days of Amaurot is going to be if this is the difficulty they’re already being faced with."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It embedded itself into the deepest parts of her soul just shy of reaching where Hades’ aether lies within her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Light felt almost as if it was clawing at her from the inside out, tearing at her very being in a desperate attempt to break this vessel of flesh and decimate her very soul to become the sin eater Hades wants her to be."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There’s still so much she wants Hades and Elidibus to see and do once they’re free from Zodiark."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her life from Amaurot feels like it was just yesterday where she would wake up in their apartment with Hades lying beside her, holding her protectively under the warm covers of their large bed on a cold winter morning."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She can’t simply move on and act as though her life with Hades never happened."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For Hades she will gladly go to the ends of the world, into the deepest pits of hell, to the darkest depths of the ocean, anywhere she needs to go for him to be saved."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How does she save Hades?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What are you doing here, Emet?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You followed through with your heroic Lightwarden slaying so I felt it only prudent I check in on my precious hero.” Hades murmured."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Leaning forward to get a better look at her face, Hades smirked, his eyes sparkling with the same gold as some of the stars up above as moonlight falls upon them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades hummed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades flicked his pale golden eyes to her for a fleeting moment before shifting his gaze up to the stars."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If you refuse to join us, then I will have no choice but to slay you should you stand between this world and the Rejoining.” Hades responded before looking to her while she continued to gaze up at the twinkling white diamonds strewn about the dark sky."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’ brows knit together."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Through Lord Zodiark’s benevolence and generosity will he resurrect our fallen once we sacrifice the inhabitants of the source to him as our final offering.” Hades said, watching as Aestelle smiles bitterly to herself and looks up to the stars yet again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is this really how she wants things to end with Hades if she’s forced to kill him?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Grabbing the amber crystal from off her lap, Aestelle sat up and looked to Hades with a soft and tender smile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stares down at it as he slowly sits up once more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No one should ever be alone, Emet, and I want you to remember that so long as you wear that necklace, you will never be alone again.” “I think this is enough talking for one night, hero.” Hades said, pushing himself to stand up while she keeps her gaze trained on the stars, missing the sheen to his eyes foretelling of his own tears as he starts off back into Mord Souq."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sparing her a fleeting glance, Hades gripped the amber around his neck just a little harder before stepping into his portal, leaving Aestelle to gaze up at the stars just as she used to."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So the Hades feels clearly hit hard when I wrote this lmao but what can I say, I'm a sucker for the feels xD Also the idea of Aestelle giving Hades a cute lil necklace is actually too adorable to pass up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Now when are you going to tell your friends the truth about Emet?” “Why have you even insisted on keeping your connection to Emet a secret?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How would they ever believe me when I say Hades and I were lovers back before the Great Sundering?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For Hades I...I will-” “So you’re guessing this is like a trial of sorts to see if you’re worthy of saving Emet?” Though if that’s the case, then how am I supposed to defeat Hades without your help?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I left out what happened before my battle with Hades when I first told you about me coming back in time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And what happens before you take on Emet?” ‘We fight as one’, you say, and then by your sacrifice I am able to stand up against Hades, your soul joining mine fixing all of the cracks this Light is creating.” Aestelle explained."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “How are  you going to fight Emet without me there to help you?” “Venat was a bit spiteful towards me declining to join Hydaelyn’s summoning so I don’t think Mother would exactly like having Azem as her beloved champion─especially now that I’m trying to save Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Mortal enemies in a taboo relationship sounds like the perfect reason for Hydaelyn to cast me aside as I grow ever closer to the inevitable fight with Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Now that leaves the question of how am I supposed to survive this battle when it was because of my blessing that I was able to weather the last bit of Hades’ attacks?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Without Her blessing, Zodiark’s magicks that Hades has at his disposal will overpower me and I’ll die…” Even though the future is looking so incredibly bleak, in the here and now Hades is still alive and well and that thought alone puts her mind at ease."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades will survive and so will she and even Elidibus will live too."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That's all I got and I'm just :'))) Because if this is indeed Mitron, I want to know how they survived after Ardbert and friends supposedly killed them (or maybe another fragment of their soul was raised up as Hades said he and Elidibus could do prior to them getting absolutely dunked on by the WoL pffttt) and I want to see what Mitron being alive does to the story now that we have no Unsundered left + Fandaniel being, well, Fandaniel lmao (sidenote: this fic is going to probably end where patch 5.3 ends for the msq (right after we bop Elidibus) so if patch 5.4 ends up doing some big reveals we might see a sequel with Aestelle and everyone else going up against Fandaniel :3 I'm not saying Elidibus and Hades will 100% survive this mess here, but if they do would you guys want to see a sequel with Aestelle and them going through patch 5.4 and probably the next dlc once that drops?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Cuz highkey I want to write Hades and Elidibus' reactions to Fandaniel, Mitron, Zenos, and literally all the hell that's about to come xD)  There just barely managing to lift away the large chunks of fallen stone from over his legs was her beloved Hades, his long snow-white hair such a contrast to his onyx black robes as he struggled to free himself from the collapsed building."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Aestelle…” Hades whispered her name, taking a few labored steps in no particular direction, looking around almost frantically."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Standing up to follow after him, Aestelle watched as Hades trudged his way through the ruins of their once fair city."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It felt as though hours passed by of Hades walking around through the ruins with her silently following by his side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Quickly she sprinted after Hades who had already broken out into a full-on run."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He looked to be in no better condition than Hades; golden hair a disheveled mess and Elidibus himself having a myriad of cuts littering his face while his platinum blonde near white hair drapes out over the Speakers arms to hang down and sway in the gentle breeze."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades called out to them both and Aestelle doesn’t need to feel his emotions to hear the relief in his voice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades shook his head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-”  “Emet-Selch!”  Aestelle covered her mouth, trying desperately to not let Hades’ emotions consume her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades turned to look at Lahabrea once more, the white-robed youth in his arms showing no signs of waking up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “How can you be so calm when the woman you love is missing as well?” Hades seethed, anger flashing across his face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" These were the first moments of the Unsundered before they had any idea what had truly happened, Lahabrea and Hades obviously in disbelief and shock as they quietly walk side by side and further away into the distance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She can almost hear Hades cries of her name still, a soft and bone-chilling remnant of that memory just for her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Standing there with moonlight cascading over his onyx black robes is Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After seeing that memory from Hades, all she feels is numb."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She had only seen the ruins of their home when Hades brought her there for their battle which didn’t exactly leave her with much time to take a look around."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Hades?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After Eulmore, she’ll be a Lightwarden in all but name and until she fights Hades, there will be nothing but that cursed blinding light yet again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If her blessing fades like it did when Midgardsormr stripped her of it, then just as she was at Nabriales’ mercy she will be powerless in the face of Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She doesn’t doubt that even if it meant allowing the Eighth Umbral Calamity to pass, Hydaelyn would make sure she’s unable to save Hades out of pure spite and would leave her to die by his hands."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “His name, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I still can’t believe even she got roped into this elaborate scheme to get Hades and I to dance together that night."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And to make matters worse, my best friend from back then, Hythlodaeus, came to me only to tell me Hades had already slipped away from the ball."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That is until Hades had managed to steal me away from the party and deeper into the Capitol.” Her voice grew softer, her smile faltering."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “This Hades.” Alisaie spoke up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And now the kiddies know Emet's true name.~ Also can we just take a moment to appreciate how adorable that would be to see Aestelle and Hades at a masquerade together ;-; Writing all of these cute moments for Hades and Aestelle has me wanting to write the cute moments with Elidibus even more xD (i have no patience send help) Hades once again comes to give them a well-needed history lesson (and further ruin his chances of ever befriending the Scions)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Someday soon.” She mused, resisting the urge to glance over her shoulder to Hades who has been silently standing near the wall since she entered the Ocular."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Y’shtola turned her attention to Hades, her beloved looking on at them all with just a small ghost of a smile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’ eyes narrowed at the young elezen, lifting a hand to rest over the amber she had gifted him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Crossing his arms over his chest and looking away from everyone, Hades exhaled an irritated sigh before managing to regain his composure and looking to the Exarch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle glanced around, watching as shooting stars fly past while Hades voice fills the open space, a singular large white orb hanging above their heads."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Faced with annihilation, we sought to imbue the star with its own will.” Hades continued, conveniently leaving out that it was by Elidibus’ own sacrifice their dark god was ever brought into existence."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A flash of frustration crossed over Hades’ expression."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If she were to follow through with her plan and strike Hades with the intention to use Hydaelyn’s blessing, Her power to enervate him and rid him of Zodiark’s corruption, what would become of him?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Just how devastating would her blow be to Hades’ soul if she were to truly try and save him..?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “For example, were She to strike you…” Hades continued, pointing directly at Ryne now who stared back at him with widened eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Only three were fortunate enough to escape the sundering─me being one of them.” Hades said solemnly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oblivious to their imperfection, ignorant of their past.” Looking up once more, Hades glanced between her friends with a cold expression."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And thus did we arrive at our time-honored modus operandi.” Hades said and with another snap of his fingers above his head, he returned the Ocular back to normal."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked amused with that response, his smirk quirking up slightly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh, don’t look at me like that.” Hades said, his tone much softer and more gentle as he turns his attention to her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Before Hades had a chance to retreat into the rift, the doors to the Ocular opened."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Also Hades isn't even trying to make friends with the Scions lmao like oh my gosh when I first saw this cutscene in-game I choked on my water from laughing It’s exhausting.” Hades said, his voice borderline on a whine while they continue down the Silent Cliffs from Wolekdorf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Take a look around, Emet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And you’re a terrible bore.” She mused, Hades rolling his eyes at her playful nature."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle wasn’t expecting to have any company on her excursion to Il Mheg, but the moment she left the Ocular earlier this morning, Hades was already drifting along nearby in the rift and had even followed her along the aetherial currents when she teleported here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Back when the world was whole, he never said it but she could see how a part of Hades wanted to join her on her adventures."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades glanced to her with knitted brows."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I would force you to hurry up and venture to Kholusia so you can continue this pointless journey of yours.” Hades said with an added sigh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades shrugged in response."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As expected with your spotless track record.” Hades said, his voice void of amusement."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stared at her for a moment longer, watching as she once again always has her attention turned upwards to the heavens, to the future."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle instantly stopped midway through her steps at his whispered words, her attention solely on Hades while he continues up the stairs as if he didn’t say a thing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades didn’t wait for her and she didn’t expect him to while she stood there stunned."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Taking one step then two, she started up the stairs once more just as Hades opened a portal into the rift to his right."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Before she could reach him, Hades walked into the swirling and writhing portal composed of pure aether, disappearing without giving her the chance to respond."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She can’t return to Hades as he is now and that’s assuming they’ll ever find a way to work past her sundered state."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If Hades asked her to kill him, could she do it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But how will history change if she rescues Hades and it becomes known that she risked everything to save an Ascian?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But she would equally hate herself just as much if she was forced to kill Hades and Elidibus again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Saving Hades and Elidibus will save the First and stop the Eighth Umbral Calamity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That reminds me, you’ve never met Emet have you?” When Feo Ul unintentionally becomes the highlight of the entire chapter lul whoops rip Hades and Granson o7 I love me the pixies xD I hope this chapter wasn't too terrible to get through!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Someone has to keep you from running off with Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The next time she sees Hades will be her last before her time is officially up and she has no choice but to fight him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “But Hades, when you really got to know him, was lovely."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades balanced me out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I try to stay optimistic even when things aren’t going well so no one around me worries, and Hades could see right through my mask."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As for him, Hades had plenty of insecurities, believe it or not."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And here I am crying over Hades day in and day out when you’ve lost someone close to you as well… I’m sorry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You know, I think I’m starting to understand now why you threw away your victory to come back and save Emet.” Ardbert said as they neared Gatetown."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You couldn’t remember Emet when you fought him, right?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I can’t imagine how hard it was to go up against Elidibus and I won’t even pretend to know what kind of hell you’ve been dealing with internally since you killed Emet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No, it’s the fact that if she dies here, she will have failed Hades and Elidibus yet again and that she cannot allow to happen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All of the drama with Hades is just going to keep ramping up until we meet him in his phantom recreation of Amaurot.~ And we might see Elidibus being referenced a little bit more the closer we get to the confrontation with Hades ;') Needless to say that this fic is going to continue even after Hades so we can see just what becomes of our favorite Emissary ^^ Hades and Elidibus, they need her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Goodbye Ran'jit o7 Thank you for being around for like 3 chapters and promptly dying :3 On the bright side next chapter we get to see Hades again so yay!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gulg and fight Innocence─and later confront Hades─and she desperately wants time to go as slowly as it possibly can."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There is still so much that can go wrong between now and her fight against Hades and later Elidibus that she doesn’t even want to envision what their grand finale might look like anymore."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Do you know the most reliable way to deal with those who stubbornly refuse to see reason?” Hades continued, the young girl pressing her hand harder on top of her amethyst and pressing the gem into her chest while keeping her eyes firmly shut."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her Hades is safe… “Oh just take it.” Hades said, his eyes shifting from her own and down to the tear in her dress."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle didn’t say a word as Hades took a step forward, closing the distance between them with ease."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades has to fully crane his neck down to look at her with how close they are, the younger girl only coming up to his chest just as she did back then."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To have my suspicions confirmed...I don’t know whether to be relieved or further heartbroken.” Hades said with a dejected laugh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Sorry…” Hades repeated at nothing above a whisper."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades didn’t hesitate in gently wrapping his arms around her small frame, pulling her close as she buries her face into his chest and softly cries."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Then I will kill you, my dear.” Hades whispered, his cold words hanging in the air while the sound of construction rings out around them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That, that is something best left unsaid.” Hades said with his voice sounding somewhat strained, no doubt from holding back his own tears."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stared down at her for a long while, his eyes brimming with unshed tears now while hers once again flow freely down her cheeks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Yes yes, I understand there are thousands of things you wish to say, but time is of the essence and you must needs compose yourself before one of your companions thinks I’ve stolen another one of your precious sweets.” Hades cut her off, chuckling softly while his arms around her tightens."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The young girl didn’t protest as Hades gently pushed her back just enough so he could lean down and be at eye-level with her, his hands resting on her hips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She closed her eyes as Hades leaned in one last time to place a second kiss to her forehead."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her chest tightened as she glanced around, looking for Hades despite knowing she won’t find him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But as bad as it got, and as empty as I felt...I can’t even begin to imagine what it must be like for Emet-Selch.” With the stars as her guide, with Ardbert as her trusted ally, and with Hades’ promise (even if it’s an empty promise), all will give her the strength to press on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So long as she yet lives, she will never stop striving towards a bright tomorrow that both Hades and Elidibus can see with their own two eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Also ooooooo Hades and Aestelle starting to get angsty :3 I have no regrets with the angst that's about to come our way."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We can't just have happy chapters with Hades after all so time for more drama from our favorite Ascian!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She can’t help but wonder how Hades must be feeling right about now after that talk they had only an hour ago."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus… He’s someone who hasn’t crossed her mind nearly as much as Hades since she’s come back in time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It’s not that Hades and Elidibus have been brought back to life but rather all of time was reversed to when she first met Hades here meaning Gaius and Estinien are still working to destroy Black Rose, Zenos is trying to reclaim his body, the Ruby Weapon is being finalized, and time is still ever moving forward."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Regardless of her goal changing so that she can save her beloved and her dearest friend, the troubles of the Source haven’t changed at all and she will need to address them when she returns─and this time with Hades by her side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He doesn’t remember Amaurot unlike herself and Hades, but he remembers his duty, that which Zodiark has complete influence over and has twisted all in the name of some pitiful excuse for salvation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades needs her first."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Until then, she can only hope Elidibus doesn’t get himself into too much trouble with Zenos or Varis while her and Hades are busy here on the First… “About Hades?” She had never thought about leaving the Scions, though in truth she hasn’t exactly thought much about what she’ll do in the future after she’s saved Hades and Elidibus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It would be selfish of her to ask the Scions to forgive Hades and Elidibus for all of the things they’ve done in order to bring about the Rejoining so how could she ever ask them to allow for those two to join their ranks?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If Hades was to ever come back, I would hope that everyone could learn to get along.” Aestelle murmured."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But if she was to leave with Hades and Elidibus, even though Aestelle knows she’d visit often and offer to help with anything the Scions needed when time allowed for it, she can’t help but wonder if Alphinaud and Alisaie would see her leaving as a betrayal of their trust and friendship... What she’s more concerned with is what exactly will a future with Hades and Elidibus look like?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After everything the Ascians have done, Aestelle doubts anyone will take her word for it when she promises to keep Elidibus and Hades out of trouble."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And that’s assuming Hades and Elidibus will even agree to abandon Zodiark entirely once she’s saved them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No matter how scared she is of failing yet again, she has a promise to keep and now so does Hades, and Aestelle will not let either of them break their promises."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades is going to shoot the Exarch to put an end to his plans─actually shoot the man."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Well, Hades has always been one for theatrics despite his serious nature so she shouldn’t even be all that surprised."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There’s going to be a number of things she’ll have to work through with Hades and her friends, and that’s to say nothing of Elidibus and Zenos’ looming presence still posing a threat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Source is her home along with Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She’s the Warrior of Light who so many place their faith in so she can’t very well go into hiding, but she can’t run around with Elidibus and Hades in tow either without risking their lives."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sometimes souls are left to drift up here before plummeting down, other times they’re given another chance at life instantaneously.” Aestelle repeated what Hades and Hythlodaeus had told her so long ago now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It was only upon Emet-Selch’s arrival that you began exhibiting strange behavior… Could it be...did his arrival trigger your Echo into revealing your own memories from the past?” “The First and Hades both need to be saved so of course.” She responded at nothing above a whisper, trying to not draw any further suspicion from the Exarch while they all watch the fae folk rage their battle against the sin eaters."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades needs her so she can’t back down now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades entrusted this to her once more when he gave the Convocations crystals to Hythlodaeus for her to care for after his death."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Possibly (but only because I honestly did forget about Elidibus while playing through 5.0 because I was so focused on Emet and don't want to forget him here as well xD) From Innocence to G'raha to Hades, it feels as though she's breaking under the weight of the world─and in a way, she is."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If she doesn’t end this soon, there may be no chance for her to save Hades and Elidibus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Such individuals do not exist in the First.” Hades’ said from where he stands at the edge of the arena."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Alas, it is not your grand scheme that will succeed, but ours.” Hades said, soon shifting his attention to the young girl struggling to hold on to her life, to their dream."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Everyone is upset, on edge, and Hades is only further stirring the pot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She can’t lose Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Taking only three long strides, Hades stopped directly in front of her, crouching down so they were almost eye level with one another as Aestelle tried desperately to contain this wretched Light, her eyes flicking to the amber necklace he still wears much how she still wears her own amethyst one."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Tell me Hades!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This we sought to do by manipulating heroes.” Hades explained for her friends benefit more so than her own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “By your Twelve, boy, have I not told you before that everything I said was the truth?” Hades asked, scowling as he looks to the young elezen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Then I simply kill you all.” Hades responded with a smirk."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades returned his troubled expression to her, so many emotions running rampant behind his eyes, almost as if he’s fighting himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That is something I lost for you when you broke your promise to return home─to return to  me.” Hades said, his eyes narrowing as his brows knit together."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’ smirk turned cynical."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I regret our relationship and want nothing more than to see you die, once and for all.” Hades said coldly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stood up, staring down at her with his lips set in a firm line."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If you truly believe that, then find me in our humble city and we shall see what your blind naivety will reward you with this time.” Hades said and then snapped his fingers, teleporting G’raha away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I did not expect that I could learn aught from man, but I may yet learn something from all the knowledge he had hoarded for his precious hero.” Taking a few steps away, Hades rose up into the air, looking down on her from above."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Dark purple spikes stabbed through her wings and kept her pinned against the stone, Hades’ staring down at her with a scarily blank expression."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Don't mind me just crying over Hades, I'm fine :'))) Also I'm having fun writing in extra Ascian things just because I can xD I shouldn't be allowed to write lul Like we got angel-wings-almost-Lightwarden Aestelle because I'm given free rein to do what I want :3 Mistakes have been made A trip to the Umbilicus reveals a very different conversation than the one she first remembers seeing through her Echo, this time between G'raha Tia and Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And then there’s Hades… Oh how things have become so twisted between them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After you collapsed, Emet vanished.” He said and then sighed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “So Hades has left for the Tempest with G’raha, and Light has returned to all of Novrandt because of me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And here I was expecting for you to run out of here the first chance you got to go after Emet.” Hades and G’raha are safe in the Tempest so I don’t have to worry about them just yet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Those kids told the others about the stories you’ve been telling so they all know who Emet is to you, and they will no doubt want answers.” “Though when they ask about your memories, it might be easier if you did tell them the whole truth and not the half-truths like Emet is so fond of.” “To what do I owe the pleasure of yet another one your most unwelcomed visits, Emet-Selch?”  Hades placed a hand over his chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With an exasperated roll of his eyes, Hades moved to lean against the door frame."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades scoffed at that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Looking out into the Ocular and to the crystal mirror emanating a bright cerulean glow, Hades smiled some to himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I had faith in your kind once, genuinely considered leaving you to your own devices only to find your lot is never satisfied.” Hades sighed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades chuckled some at that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I will be gone no sooner than I had arrived which is why I must ask that you watch over her in my stead when such a time comes.” Hades shook his head while giving the Exarch a halfhearted shrug."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “As her ally, I feel that it should be obvious I care for her wellbeing as all of you do.” Hades muttered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Good, then I will leave you to your final preparations.” Hades said, turning to walk back out into the Ocular.\r\n\t“What is it, Emet-Selch?”  Chuckling, Hades stepped through his portal and disappeared into the rift with an absentminded wave of his hand over his head, leaving G’raha to grumble to himself as he once again returns to reading his tome.\r\n\t“Hades came to G’raha shortly before I took on Ran’jit.\r\n\tTo save Hades and Elidibus she should listen to Ardbert and only tell them what they need to know for the time being.\r\n\tAnd when they see her fair city in all of its former glory, they’ll have no choice but to believe her and Hades.\r\n\t“The Hades from the stories of your past.” Alisaie spoke up.\r\n\tYou mean to tell me that same Hades is Emet-Selch?” Emet-Selch’s true name is Hades.” “I’m sorry… But the reality of this mess is that I couldn’t risk endangering Emet by revealing our past to you.\r\n\t“So you haven’t been talking with Emet-Selch in secret then?” Alphinaud asked.\r\n\tEmet knows little more than any of you.” Not until you have seen mine and Emet’s home with your own eyes.\r\n\tMaybe Emet might know more about why I’m the way I am.\r\n\t“Save  Emet-Selch?\r\n\t“Emet won’t hurt him─there’s no point in it.\r\n\tBut I don’t understand how it is you think Emet can be saved.\r\n\tYour origins are yet a mystery, and a reversal for tempering─tempering by an ancient primal no less if Emet-Selch is to be believed─is simply unheard of.\r\n\t“I’ll explain more once we’ve reached the Tempest and you can see mine and Emet’s home with your own eyes.\r\n\tThe Great Sundering claimed mine and Emet’s home just as he’s told you twice now.\r\n\t“But knowing Emet, he’s made something out of the ruins beneath the water that I think him and I can both agree should be seen by you all.” If it is your wish to save Emet-Selch alongside the Exarch and the First, then that is what I wish to help you achieve.\r\n\tYou have shown me that the impossible is never truly impossible and if saving you can be achieved through saving Emet and the Exarch, then you can count on me to stand by your side as well.\r\n\tI will aid thee in thy plan to rescue Emet-Selch if that is thy wish.\r\n\tAnd here I thought I did at least a somewhat decent job at keeping my secrets considering none of you caught on to Emet’s true identity or my past relationship with him.” And the kids are the first ones to defend Aestelle ;-; couldn't be more wholesome lul Fun fact, I have rewritten that last conversation about five times now and at this point, I'm just going with this version of it because I'm pulling teeth trying to make it exactly how I want it to go and this is probably the closest I'm going to get :'))) Writing is hard when things just don't go how you want them to no matter how many times you fix it xD It's just balancing out how I feel about this chapter since I really like how I wrote the convo between Hades and G'raha so I had to get frustrated over something lul win some you lose some Falling unconscious in her battle with Granson against Dikaiosyne, Aestelle slips into another one of her memories, though surprisingly it isn't one of her many with Hades.\r\n\t“So what exactly is the point in coming all the way out here when Emet is in the Tempest?” “What does his crystal have to do with you saving Emet and rescuing the Exarch?” Without the lamp, we won’t be shown the way to Emet’s phantom Amaurot.” She explained.\r\n\t“You’re forgetting that Emet needs you more.” Ardbert cut her off.\r\n\tBut where there are many Scions for them all to turn to in times of need, there is only one me so I have to prioritize Hades and Elidibus above all else.\r\n\tWhen she lost Ardbert right before her fight with Hades, it didn’t truly sink in until much later that he was truly gone and wouldn’t be able to have conversations like these with her anymore.\r\n\tEven with the Exarch back safe and sound in the Crystarium and all of her friends surrounding her, praising her for her heroic deeds yet again, she couldn’t let go of the fact she had killed Hades─and in turn decimated what little hold on her composure she had left.\r\n\tNo one understood what she meant when she would insist that Hades meant something more than to simply remember his home and Amaurot.\r\n\tJust as she’s beginning to remember who she was in the beginning, fate is trying to force her hand into ending the world and the history her, Hades, and all of their brethren loved with every fiber of their being.\r\n\tHades had a point in saying she was great once─once, they all were.\r\n\tShe’s at it’s mercy as she falls into a memory from the past long forgotten by all with the exception of herself and Hades.\r\n\tYou won’t believe what Hades─I mean Emet just told me!” She said excitedly, already closing the door behind her and quickly skipping over to stand beside the large piano taking up most of the center of the small library’s open space.\r\n\t“But that’s why I came straight here the second Emet and Hythlodaeus gave me the news.” “Well, even if Emet can be a little overprotective at times, he doesn’t get to choose who I befriend.\r\n\t“I think you will be disheartened to know that I too─much as Emet-Selch did─opposed Fandaniel and Halmarut’s recommendation of asking you to become the next Azem.” “I know Emet is just scared that something bad will happen to me which is why he said I shouldn’t take the offer.\r\n\t“Despite your innocent displays of youthful naivety, you have shown me time and time again that your age is merely a number, your true self much more mature than even Emet-Selch gives you credit for.\r\n\t“But, selfishly, I ask you listen to Emet-Selch and decline our offer.”  “You and Emet and Hythlodaeus are always protecting me, and I appreciate it.\r\n\tI do want to return home to you and Emet.” She said as she took a seat beside him on the piano bench, lazily letting her head fall to rest against his shoulder while she listens to the soft melody she’s heard countless times before.\r\n\t“Nothing in this world means more to me than you and Emet.\r\n\t“Emet is the only person who can help me.\r\n\tIt’s a little hard to believe that she’s going to be stepping foot in Hades’ phantom Amaurot again in only a short while now.\r\n\tAestelle has known that Elidibus meant a great deal to her based solely on the emotions she felt raging within her heart the moment her memories slowly began to return to her following her triumph over Hades.\r\n\tDoes Hades even have the answer to that question..?\r\n\tSo slowly but surely Elidibus is going to work his way into this fic or so help me god xD As much as I love Emet, this fic isn't going to be just a simple WoL\/Hades fic because there's no fun in a romance with no problems (and it's not very realistic either tbh, as if anything in this fic is realistic pffttttt).\r\n\tBut now I leave it up to you, my dear readers, to theorize what role exactly Elidibus (and possibly even Hythlodaeus) play in Aestelle and Hades' relationship :3 When they traveled to the Tempest in search of Hades and G’raha before she came back in time, there was something achingly familiar about these ruins Y’shtola had previously asked her to help her inspect.\r\n\tMemories of home and of her relationship with Hades and her friendships with Hythlodaeus and the Convocation and even those final dark days of first the true Final Days and then the lead up to Hydaelyn’s fracturing of Zodiark...none of it should be within her minds grasp to remember.\r\n\tHer pearl white eyes flicker over to the clouded fog that hides Hades’ recreation of their home, the faintest of lights shimmering behind the gloom.\r\n\tIt might have to do with Hades, or it could be the heavens' own intervention just as her coming back in time has to have been.\r\n\tThe Light may even kill her before she makes it to Hades.\r\n\tLahabrea is already gone, all that’s left is for her champion to go and slay Emet-Selch and lastly Elidibus.\r\n\tYou just conveniently left out the part that you and Emet-Selch  share  this history.” “What Emet told you back in the Qitana Ravel and then later in the Ocular.\r\n\tThose ruins that Y’shtola is looking at,” Aestelle paused while she nodded off towards the older woman, “those are mine and Emet’s remaining remnants of home.\r\n\tBut even seeing these broken buildings the Ondo have made homes for themselves out of doesn’t convince you that Emet has been telling the truth.\r\n\tNow imagine if I had told you any of this when Emet first showed himself to us…” Said you had to keep this from us since we only would have grown warier of both yourself and Emet-Selch if you explained everything in its entirety.” He said, leaning back on his hands and looking up to the murky waters of the Tempest being held at bay by Bismarck’s breath.\r\n\t“Do you intend to leave us if Emet-Selch can truly be saved?” But as I’ve told Alisaie, I’ll have to decide with Emet what’s best for us once I’ve successfully saved him from our cruel fate.” This is her home they’re talking about so lightly, a calamity that took everything away from her and Hades.\r\n\tNo wonder Hades was so upset with Alphinaud for trying to equate these mortal lives to the lives of their fallen brethren.\r\n\tWhether Hades likes it or not, these are the lives their brethren sacrificed themselves to create and it falls to them to guard these souls, regardless of their sundered status.\r\n\t“The quicker we get to Emet-Selch, the sooner you’ll be cured so let’s not waste any more time.” Home is so close─Hades is so close.\r\n\tOne wrong move and Hades will die by her hands yet again.\r\n\tI may not be able to do much, but the least I can do is make sure we’re shown the way to where Emet has run off to.” “Aestelle, if I could ask you something before we’ve seen this, thing, you and Emet-Selch seem so keen on showing us.” Y’shtola spoke up.\r\n\t“Despite his many protestations, I never quite believed Emet-Selch was telling the truth.” “Aestelle, do you...do you wish for the same as Emet and the other Ascians?” But what Emet and the others are attempting to do isn’t ever going to restore our home.\r\n\t“Zodiark’s tempering was something I escaped…Emet and the other’s, on the other hand, were not so fortunate.” “A city that which you and Emet-Selch both wish for us to see, I’m guessing?” She asked to which the younger girl flashed her a bright, seemingly innocent smile in response.\r\n\tDon't mind me just pretending as if I didn't write that last bit with Urianger and Ryne about the Scions going behind Aestelle's back to kill Hades should she fail in saving him :'))) Totally not dying inside lmaO Also more talk on Hydaelyn being an angy primal and abandoning Aestelle to her fate is my way of saying I'm not a fan of Hydaelyn, clearly :p She was hoping maybe there was something left to find, something that would show her what it is she needs to do to save Hades...but it seems Aestelle is doomed to forever be left wanting for answers where they may very well be none.\r\n\t“Emet has always been fond of city-building.” Aestelle said, her smile warm despite the sad tone her voice had taken on as she walked further ahead and started down the cliffside ridge leading to the lift that will take them into her home.\r\n\tEmet made this perfect recreation of our home and you should learn about who Lahabrea, Igeyorhm, and Nabriales were, not remember them in their worst moments.” “Alright, now that that’s taken care of, on behalf of the Convocation allow me to officially welcome you to Amaurot, mine and Emet’s lost home.” She said and then wandered into the lift.\r\n\tThe Ancients walking past were no more than the shades she remembers Hades recreating when she first traveled here, nothing appearing out of place in the slightest.\r\n\tSo, what exactly is it Hades is wanting to show her this time?\r\n\t“There’s something I want to go see for myself before we confront Emet in the Capitol.\r\n\tShe’s home in Amaurot and Hades is here too.\r\n\tIf there is something for her to find, she’s sure Hades would have left it in his old office or possibly with their dear old friend.\r\n\tShe has to at least try and find something, anything that will lead her that much closer to understanding what it is Hades is truly planning behind the scenes.\r\n\t“I was hoping to speak with either Emet-Selch or Hythlodaeus.\r\n\tEven if she knows this is nothing more than a recreation from Hades’ memories, walking among these shades through Amaurot feels natural, right.\r\n\tHades purposefully instilled these shades with the knowledge of her, but for what reason?\r\n\t“I’ve walked around a bit but figured it’d be better to stick with you now that it’s almost time to fight Emet.” Sending Minfilia here to halt the Flood and having my comrades sacrifice their souls only to render all of that pointless by allowing you to die and for Emet to win, drowning the First in Light?\r\n\t“I’m hoping my Echo will show me what it is Hades is planning.” Both her aether and Hades’ react the same, sharing in the heartache and despair of seeing their lost home once more.\r\n\tHades may be lost in his anguish and Elidibus lost in Zodiark’s corruption, but she can still reach out and grab their hands, pulling them through the darkness to the other side.\r\n\tEver since Hades gave Hythlodaeus the Convocations soul crystals to pass onto her and in turn giving her Echo the push it needed to begin unlocking her memories, Amaurot has come to hold such a deeper meaning─a deeper connection even.\r\n\tIt hurts to think that this is where Hades wants to die, in these very ruins.\r\n\tThe path diverges here between saving Hades and killing him so there has to be something she’s missed that will point her in the direction of the path that will see her beloved saved.\r\n\tHades’ wish of dying here will never come true.\r\n\t“You sure you’re ready to confront Emet?” If it’s Halone’s wish to see me succeed, then I’m placing my faith in the Fury that she will grant me the strength and power to save Hades.” This chapter I wrote as more of an interlude between the arrival to the Tempest and the monologue Hades gives just before he opens the way to the Final Days of Amaurot so forgive me if this chapter feels a bit filler-like."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I always try to make even the more filler chapters have meaning or reveal something so that they're not pointless and I tried to do that here as well but I dunno, lately I've been feeling a bit down on my writing and questioning if it's any good xD Don't mind me though because now we're getting to the true good part of \"can Aestelle save Hades or is she just going to die?\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades wishes to usher the First unto its end."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Anyways, did you all ask around and see what Emet’s recreated?” Emet-Selch, the Architect, Elidibus, the Emissary, you get the idea.” She explained as Amaurotine shades walked past them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What Emet failed to tell you in the Qitana Ravel is that for the Convocation to summon Zodiark to save our world, it would require half of our number to sacrifice themselves."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And if we follow Emet-Selchs recounts, then that would imply you failed in finding the answers you sought.” Y’shtola murmured."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This was the sacrifice made by mine and Emet’s people in order to ensure life would not end with us.” “Now that we have the full picture presented to us, I see that Emet-Selch has indeed been telling the truth since he arrived.” “I know that all the Ascians have done is horrendous and cannot simply be overlooked or forgiven...but I still have to ask that you give me this chance to save Emet and Elidibus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet and Elidibus mean everything to me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If I save Emet and Elidibus, the Ascian threat will fade away over time, our goal of bringing peace to all still being the outcome of me saving my beloved and dearest friend."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And none of you know for sure that by saving the First and killing Emet and Elidibus will without a doubt prevent the Eighth Umbral Calamity.” Aestelle responded."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Killing Emet and Elidibus does not guarantee that anything in the future G’raha saw will be prevented."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And I don’t care how much any one of you may hate Emet and my friends, he is still my beloved and I will see him saved regardless of if you stand with or against me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Saving Emet-Selch and Elidibus dost not require our intercession.” Her fellow astrologian said, patiently waiting for her to take the crystal in his hands."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They’re going to kill Hades regardless of what she says or does."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Good,” she said with a small smile once she turned to face her friends once more, “I will always fight for what is right in this world, and if there’s no other choice but to kill Emet to save the First then I will be the one to do it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They will kill Hades even if she does find the answer to saving him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The moment she came back in time, it was clear she was alone on this mission of hers to saving Hades and Elidibus...but she can’t deny that part of her had hoped that maybe the Scions would come around and at least see that killing Hades isn’t the only path available to them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But the Exarch said the First has to be saved in order to prevent the Eighth Umbral Calamity and they believe that if Hades is left to live, then the First is forever in danger, his death the only sure way to saving the First."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To be so close to saving Hades only to have not only Hydaelyn but her very friends turn their backs on her─she’s not even all that surprised anymore."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I gave you very specific instructions.” Hades said, his brows falling into a scowl."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch!” Are you so lost without them?” Hades asked as his expression only darkened."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Countless reincarnations of the woman I love dying for the very false beings that would never do the same for her...and you think I wouldn’t end this cycle if given the means to free you?” Hades scoffed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades…” She said his name at nothing above a whisper."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Like you insisted that you could fix all of our woes before the Final Days?” Hades cut her off, crossing his arms over his chest as his smile turns more wry than anything."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It was our failure, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Alisaie moved to stand at Aestelle’s side, looking on at Hades with a determined flame flickering behind her eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’ expression turned sour."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Too weak and feeble-minded to serve as stewards of any star!” Hades exhaled an exasperated sigh, looking to her with a saddened smile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades...” Aestelle tried only to stop herself, his cold, pale golden eyes stealing away anything she intended to say."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Of course they wouldn’t!” Hades then yelled, looking past her to her party of friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked down at her, a frown tugging on the corners of his lips, his shoulders falling."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Truly.” Alphinaud spoke up from behind her, Hades cold glare being shot over her head and to the young elezen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle keeps her eyes trained on Hades, her heart feeling as though it could break right along with his own while they listen to the crackling fires that consumed their fair city rage on just through those doors."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Turning to walk away, Hades didn’t bother waiting for a response from any of them as he started for the growing flames beyond the doors."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She stopped, Hades slowing to a stop as well as she turns to look at her friends, the fires practically licking at their sides now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I have already fought my way through this hell once, and so it’s not my worth Emet is judging."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Well said, my dear.” Hades murmured, grabbing her hand after she turned to face the flames once more, the two of them staring on at the ruination, together."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades revealing parts of his motives and talking about having to watch Aestelle die over the course of hundreds of thousands of lives is just *my heart hurt writing that* ;-; There is still a great many things I have to continue explaining through the story (Aestelle's appearance not changing from before the Great Sundering, Hydaelyn's crap blessing just nyooming into oblivion and what that means for the WoL, Elidibus' importance in her and Hades' lives, etc etc etccc) but I thought I'd give a small tidbit of background, 1000% adopting the Ascian soul reincarnation theme that's talked about in the Eden raids :3 Is Aestelle an Ascian and just doesn't remember?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ¯\\_(ツ)_\/¯ Can we safely assume Hades is responsible for her current incarnation being who she is?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Honestly, from writing the prologue out of grief after finishing 5.3 to writing this chapter and thinking of all the chapters yet to come, it's astonishing to think this fic has truly gotten so out of hand and so quickly at that xD On the bright side, with the climax of Hades fate nearing its conclusion, that means Elidibus is soon to be joining the chaos.~ Can't wait for that hell lul As Ardbert guessed, their answer to saving Hades was found in the heavens."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle’s hold on Hades hand tightens when a flying behemoth slowly flaps its wings and passes by the Akadaemia, pausing only for a bright beam of light to shoot from its mouth and lay waste to an entire bridge, Amaurotines falling into the fiery pits of hell below."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “‘Tis shocking to think you would still choose me over those friends of yours.” Hades spoke up, both of them watching as Thancred leads her party of Scions through the chaos-filled streets and towards where the First Doom lies patiently in wait."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Then I will be the one to kill you.” Hades sighed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We know you did all you could to prevent this catastrophe.” Hades murmured, the First Doom raining down meteors in an attempt to kill her friends who are none the wiser to their audience’s whereabouts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The future is where we belong together, Hades, not lost in our memories.” Hades grasped her hand even tighter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not a word more is spoken as a portal roils to life behind them, Hades sparing the destruction of their home a final glance before turning to pull the short girl into his heartfelt embrace, his arms wrapping around her small frame and leaving no room for her to pull back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Wherever you and Elidibus are is where I belong so no, I’m not going to humor you.” And with a bright smile, Aestelle looked up at Hades as a silent tear slipped down her cheek."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Regardless of what they do or say, I stand with you, my beloved Hades.” She said, pulling back only to have to abruptly turn away, another coughing fit overtaking her as the Light attempts to break free yet again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Staying quiet, Hades placed a hand lightly against her back, guiding her towards his magicks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Don’t hurt them!” She said, quickly moving to stand in front of Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Despite what you may think, Emet-Selch, we are capable of standing at Aestelle’s side.” “Killing them would only hurt you further, but there’s no harm in showing them how little they truly compare to your might.” Hades said and with a snap of his fingers, a harsh wind of aether went blowing past her, smashing into her friends and sending them all falling and smacking harshly into the crystalline ground."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And you would entrust these woebegone mortals with the fate of these stars?” Hades scoffed behind her as she tried to stand despite the Light still fracturing her from the inside out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades crosses his arms over his chest, looking on at them with both pity and anger swimming behind his eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though even through the excruciating pain, she managed to hold onto the aether Hades gave to her that lies deep within her soul."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “More prattle.” Hades scoffed as he raised a hand up into the air."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You still sacrifice yourself for these frail creatures who are incapable of protecting themselves?” Hades sighed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “They are stronger than you give them credit for, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They are not deserving of your loyalty, or your love and compassion!.” Hades said, his image becoming muddled the more her grip on consciousness fades due to the Light continuing its attack on her fracturing soul."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It is true that all we hold dear is fated to fade away.” The miqo’te woman said, Hades completely hidden from view within the smoke left behind by her incantation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Do not presume to speak of  my  future!” Hades sneered, his cold gaze landing on Aestelle as he steps out of the dark smoke."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could have easily kept her close if he truly wanted her to share the Ascian fate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades understands the laws of creation and he understands that the world can never truly be brought back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thancred leaped over her, crashing his gunblade down into the barrier Hades has created around himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With the last of her strength she pushed herself to stand, staggering in front of the redhead and for a brief moment, Aestelle saw true fear streak across Hades face as a dark spike impaled her, tearing through flesh and allowing the Light to come spewing out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Whatever is on the other side of these doors will surely lead you to the answer you need to save Emet, and you’ve come too far to hesitate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I never thought I’d say this, but I’m on Team Ascian and want to see Emet freed from his lonely existence.” We have watched thee across the time of numerous lives, the son of souls, that which thee and thine call Hades, hast ever guided thee towards this ending to fates plan.” “I don’t understand… Who is Astraea and why call Hades the son of souls?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The son of souls, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ‘Tis coincidence thou wouldst come to be so close with Hades, not even Nymeia foreseeing of thy both coming together to saveth thine home, albeit at a great cost."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Twelve are going to help her save the First and Emet then, right?” Ardbert asked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ardbert has to die in order for her to save Hades and later Elidibus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We’ll see Emet saved and then Elidibus and then the whole damn world and all the others!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I think Emet would like that one what with being some drama enthusiast and all.” Aestelle stood tall, Hades’ eyes going wide as she looks at him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “This stage was never yours, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You don’t get to decide what’s best for us by yourself, Hades.” Hades turned around at the new voice, Aestelle’s eyes going wide when she sees who’s barely able to keep himself standing near the edge of the crystalline platform."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Don’t you know better than to get in the middle of a lovers’ quarrel?” Hades said coldly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “No…” Hades muttered, turning to face her fully now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “For a story with no true villains, there sure is a lot of victims…” Aestelle muttered to herself, Hades walking painfully slow towards her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Angry Hades, Aestelle now has *four* sin eater wings because fancy, and we finally get the first real introduction to those who have been watching over her from the heavens aka Halone and supposedly some of the other gods."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This was a longggg chapter, fitting for it being posted on the first day of the new year ^^ I can't wait to keep writing this chaotic fic and soon introduce Gaia along with Elidibus like can you all imagine the pure wholesomeness that will be Emet meeting Gaia if he lives?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Just, ugh, this fic is only making me wish Emet didn't die in the actual game even more xD It doesn't help that the Scions keep referencing him every once in a while too :'))) Like Square, if you're going to keep talking about him then bring him back in some epic revival (don't know how they'd do it but hey, if Zenos and the Garleans can create a fake Echo I'm convinced Square can come up with some reason to revive an Unsundered Ascian), and if they don't want to revive him *then stop having the Scions talk about him because my heart hurts* After fighting off shades of lost friends and using an axe of purest Light to strike her lover, it becomes apparent that from the beginning, she has been alone on this quest to save Hades... Hades voice came from somewhere deeper within the darkness, Aestelle remaining still on the small bit of flooring under her feet she can see."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But it’s not simply a void, it’s Hades’ own aether."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades may say he’s fighting for Zodiark, and he is, but she knows deep down even he acknowledges how futile their plan to rejoin all the worlds truly is."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades has been planning this from the start."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “But we do.” Hades said, the darkness slowly shrinking back to reveal the amethyst crystalline flooring once more, a phantom shade of Nabriales standing on the opposite side of the circular platform in front of her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I have crushed your dreams countless times before, watching as you die in some vain attempt to save everyone only for us Ascians to bring about the next rejoining.” Hades responded and then Nabriales was moving, raising a hand and casting Double, then Triple, and suddenly a large dark purple orb of pure aether was racing towards her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But if Hades has created shades of them two, then that must mean- How does it feel knowing it was you who ultimately killed those you loved the most?” Hades asked, his voice echoing from all directions as she hurries to imbue herself with the Ewer and set’s off to casting all manner of incantations she can think of, stars shooting past in her attempt to cut through these shades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her wings granted her just enough mobility to dodge everything, Nabriales remaining on the crystalline floor while Igeyorhm and Lahabrea continuously move around through the air, the masks Hades has conjured still circling this battle as she tries to understand what it is she should do."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She has to remind herself that they’re shades, mere creations being used with Hades as their puppeteer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" These two grouches won’t cease this terrible debate of theirs and ‘tis rare to find you separate from Emet-Selch’s side when you are home."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus and Emet-Selch have already told you that we must needs look elsewhere for our solution to this impending catastrophe─where do you think you’re going?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Even now you falter under the weight man has placed upon your shoulders.” Hades voice cut through her thoughts, quelling her Echo into a dull hum."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As the three elements grew above their respective mages, she watched with fear reflected in her eyes as the three people she considered closest to her after Hades and Elidibus made ready to be the ones to kill her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You still breathe?” Hades asked softly as his dark aether circling the crystalline platform retreated into himself, the unimaginable large form granted to him by the Underworld slowly nearing the edge of the platform just behind her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He used to insist that he hated taking the seat of Emet-Selch, but he was always secretly proud to be given the honor even if Hythlodaeus was the first to be asked to take the position."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Join me, or die.” Hades said, lowering one of his more normal hands towards her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I will be the one to save you and save our brethren, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lost wandering, without a place to call her home because the one man she truly had a connection to has been taken from her by your  dear Mother.” Hades sighed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Reaching up to grasp at the amethyst that hangs around her neck, she looked on at Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Dark purple aether began to emanate from Hades' form and before she could react, cold chains snaked around her waist, pinning her arms and wings harshly to her body."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You dare call our great work  selfish?” Hades seethed as his aether began to encase her in the growing darkness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her feet left the ground as the darkness continued to consume her, Hades Underworld form fading away as it becomes increasingly harder to breathe."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Anything to save Hades is all she can think of."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Amaurot would be remade, the Convocation could resume their duty as stewards of order, she would be free to live with Hades in a world they themselves loved with all their heart and still do."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The smallest part of Hades’ aether that resides deep within her soul goes still with a vague sense of despair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Can she honestly give up on them even if they’re going to try and kill Hades anyway?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not even for Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus was right, loving Hades makes her blind and do the dumbest of things sometimes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The more the Light grows, the further back the dark abyss is pushed from her, revealing that Hades has brought her to the ruins of Amaurot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No…” Hades said from where he towers over her at the edge of this still standing building among the fallen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Stars weave into constellations above her, Hades calling forth his own dark magicks to try and snuff out her light."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The her from when the world was whole could surely put up a fight against Hades, if not outright overpower him if it came down to which one of them was the more powerful mage."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It’s once the darkness has covered everything else but himself from view that Aestelle truly looks at Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With one last flurry of stars shredding through him, Hades has no choice but to retreat into the darkness he himself has created, shielding himself from any more attacks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With large clawed hands outstretched, Hades slowly closed the gap between them as she went on the defensive."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Using the two remaining wings still somewhat in-tact on her back, Aestelle pushed herself into the air and directly between where the cracks are forming in the aether and Hades just as Thancred broke through."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She casts a single Gravity into the air where Thancred was moving quickly towards Hades, knocking him away and throwing him onto the ground where the rest of their friends have already appeared."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades immediately shifts his attention to the Scions and she can feel his anger festering deep within her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When he grabbed her wrist and began yanking her back to Fanow, Hades stayed near and watched as she was manhandled, bruises later appearing on her wrist that night."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Staring on at Hades' mask, she holds out her hand behind her and channels all of the Light within her to take shape."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Dragging its blade across the ground, she closes her eyes as Hades' claws begin to wrap around her, the axe already being hurled directly for him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All of the noise, the scream she hadn’t even realized she let out, the eerie groan of Hades' own movement and yell as he made ready to kill her, it all faded away into nothing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She opened her eyes just as he did his own, Hades standing in front of her on this rooftop deep within the ruins of their home, the sun beginning to ascend from below the horizon off in the distance and to their side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He’s...Hades is alright."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You used the Light to remove Zodiark’s tempering..?” Hades asked softly, his chin resting on her shoulder while his arms lie lifelessly at his sides."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We have our entire lives ahead of us now… We can be together again, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades pressed a little harder into her, shifting ever so slightly so he could instead sit down properly with his shoulder tucked under her chest and his head resting over where he can perfectly hear her heartbeat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My beloved Hades, I’ll protect you…” “Knew of your plans to kill Emet?” She asked in return."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle’s blood ran cold, her hold on Hades tightening."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You intend to follow through with this wicked, misguided plan to kill Emet?” “When I told you the truth about who Emet is to me, you all said you’d help me save him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Shaking her head, she hugged Hades as tightly as she could, closing her eyes while her aether begins to glow and pulse around her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I have to do what’s best for Emet and I─and right now, that’s getting away from you.” EMET IS ALIVE AND I'M HAPPY honestly, I have thought up probably a dozen alternate endings to this chapter\/ fic with variations of Emet dying, or Aestelle dying, or hell maybe even one of the Scions or Elidibus later dying so writing for this outcome was a hard choice to make but I'm happy I made it ^^ Aestelle's view of her friends twisting into a distorted image of possible villains and having them hold fast to their notion of Emet still being an evil buttmunch makes for some interesting scenario possibilities in the near future :3 Also I just remembered that G'raha is actually lost on what's going on since he didn't get her explanation of \"oh yeah btw Emet is my significant other and I'm kinda sorta but not an Ascian\" talk before she left for Il Mheg with Granson lul whoops sorry cat boi but you're not getting any WoL\/G'raha from me in this fic xD maybe if I ever write another fic after this one I'll consider making it WoL\/G'raha but at this point I'm too attached to the Ascians rip Also the Eden raids are going to play a major part in this story too alongside Eli doing his Ascian things so I have to start thinking of what Emet's take on Eden (and all of the spoilers that come with e9-e12 bring with them) will be."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Returning to this phantom recreation of Amaurot with Hades lying asleep in her arms, the both of them on the ground within the Macarenses Angle in front of the main Aetheryte is surreal to say the least─like this is all some cruel dream she’ll wake up from any second now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At least until Hades wakes up, has had some time to think things through, and has gotten rid of this adrenaline coursing through her veins, she needs to hide."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I can do this…” Aestelle muttered to herself, slowly finding a way to wrap one of Hades’ arms around her shoulders and move him into a position where he is more or less draped over the side of her shoulder."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It’s difficult, but she somehow manages to shakily raise herself to her feet with Hades hanging off of her shoulder, his feet dragging considering their substantial height difference."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At this point she doesn’t even think Hades is sleeping."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Tripping, she stumbles forward and nearly falls completely, having to drop down onto one knee to better steady herself while she holds tightly onto Hades' arm to keep from jostling him too much."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Will they wait for Hades to wake up before casting a final judgment on his life?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Only once Hades is awake and she knows he’s fine will she even consider going to talk with them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Dammit all!” Aestelle cried out, trying again and again to stand with Hades only to wear herself out even more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades has done and made his way through so much worse than she has at this point and he’s prevailed so surely picking the two of them up and making it to their home is an easy enough task for her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She needs to get to their home where she knows Hades will be safe."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “The one and only─or were you hoping for Emet-Selch to have created a shade of some other member of the Convocation?” He asked, moving his hand forward a little closer to her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had recreated Hythlodaeus before, but never anyone else they knew."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That her friends will come around in time and Hades will wake up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The large shade of Lahabrea carefully lifted Hades from off her back, Aestelle’s arms and legs finally giving out as she falls to lie on the ground."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades scoffed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch, you know she can do no such thing for only she can ever carry out the duties of Azem."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Not when Fandaniel is still spreading those obscene rumors of a newly budding relationship between you and the Emissary.” Hades grumbled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We each have work to be completing instead of frolicking in the snow.” Hades said, moving to walk beside her and reaching for her hand out of habit, Elidibus silently following only a few paces behind them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades exhaled an exasperated sigh, white puffs of smoke filling the air just in front of his face now as the snow continues to fall."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I do not deceive myself into believing Emet-Selch regards me as such.” I was afraid you were going to start referring to me with an air of warm familiarity.” Hades responded blandly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her hold on Hades’ hand tightened."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Perhaps when we aren’t tied down by our offices you may have the privilege of taking me along on some grand adventure.” Hades said as they neared the Hall of Rhetoric The ride up to one of the top floors was spent with Aestelle and Hades bickering back and forth while the Emissary listened on, not adding a thing to the conversation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Can I not give you and Emet a present at the same time?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Must we remove our masks?” Hades asked tiredly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His light lilac purple eyes caught her attention first, such a stark contrast to Hades’ pale golden ones."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades didn’t waste a moment in taking his satchel and opening it, Elidibus curiously picking his up and weighing it in a single hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thank you my dear.” Hades said, offering her a genuine smile he usually reserves for when they’re alone, her own smile softening."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Stop being such a bore, Hades!” “Fine fine, but only because you told me too so nicely.” She giggled, walking around the table to stand beside Hades while he placed his mask over his face as well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades will have woken up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Everyone will look past her saving Hades and push aside their own discontent, being understanding of her situation and despite their own feelings, accepting her and Hades or at the very least tolerating them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She turned to look down at her side only to find Hades lying asleep beside her, chest slowly rising and falling and his expression calm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades…” She whispered his name barely loud enough for even her to hear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “H-Hades…” She stuttered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades will wake up...he has to."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And just as she feared, something is terribly wrong with Hades aether."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Now attuning herself to the diurnal sect, Aestelle attempted to use the healing of the Keeper to remedy the unseen and unknown problem causing Hades aether to act so strangely."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The sudden familiar voice caused her to jump, breaking the link she created to Hades instantly as she opened her eyes and looked to the now open door to their bedroom."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle slowly looked to Hythlodaeus, her hold on Hades' hand still firm as if she’s scared he might slip away from her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades told us of your strange ability to remember that time before time and wanted you to have the lives of our friends so that you would never be forced to walk alone after his banishment into the abyss.” “Though the world be sundered and our souls set adrift, where you walk, my love, fate shall surely follow…” Aestelle repeated the words Hades had said to her when she had first held her crystal just a few short days before her inevitable fight with Elidibus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Please, just wake up Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though our world is gone, Hades has always believed in you most of all, our shepherd to the stars in the dark."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Take heart in the knowledge that despite everything, Hades believes in you and knows you will do what’s best for all.” Closing her eyes once more, she lifted Hades' hand to place a feather-light kiss to his knuckles."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus is right and Hades has placed his trust in her, and even in her friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’ll find a way to wake you, my beloved Hades… I promise...” This chapter hurt to write xD Hades and Elidibus got me hard in the feels and just :'))) These next few chapters are going to at the very least send me on an emotional rollercoaster lul I'm also writing and rewriting them a lot because I want them to be *just right* and they aren't coming out exactly how I want them to ;-; determination will win out or so help me god I'm going to go level gnb to 80 instead of blm xD because obviously she'd leave if they tried to murder Hades lmaO I was going to rewrite it too but then I thought about it more and something kind of clicked as to why my brain would write them with those reactions (because I really just write whatever comes to mind and don't think ahead much to any."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" From the Scions perspective, they've known Aestelle for years and have watched her grow and have grown alongside her to the point that even though she's explained to them her history with the Ascians and Hades, they probably haven't truly grasped the scale and reality of her situation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet is just some Ascian who in front of them hasn't exactly shown much to any affection towards Aestelle so that doesn't really help sell the whole \"we were in a relationship before shit hit the fan\" story xD And also, the idea that primal tempering can be reversed is still so far-fetched to them it simply can't be possible that she'd find a way to detemper an Ascian (from their pov I mean)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In their eyes, killing Emet is the surefire way to save the First since they also don't know about Elidibus eventually coming to stir up trouble."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Probably why she was the only one kept in the dark about the Scions intending to go forward with their plan to kill Hades after Urianger gave Aestelle that piece of fake white auracite."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sitting on her knees, Aestelle stayed at Hades’ side, laying her upper body over his to press her ear to his chest as she just sits there waiting for one of the shades to come back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How could they insist Hades has to die after she saved him?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If she had to guess, Urianger only gave her that fake white auracite so that Ryne wouldn’t try to stop Thancred when the moment came to kill Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ryne has been the most invested in her stories of the past, asking hundreds upon thousands of questions about anything and everything so of course she would understand what Hades means to her the best."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Can you hear me..?” Aestelle asked softly, placing her chin down on Hades' chest now while she continues to sit beside him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But to someone as well versed in the subject matter of the soul, Beq Lugg might be her best option to turn to for at least a second opinion and maybe even a solution to curing Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sure, Ryne didn’t want to kill Hades, but the others?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Who’s to say they won’t try something again if she brings Hades with her to the Crystarium?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But then that leaves the problem of if she has to go to the Crystarium to talk with G’raha about meeting with Beq Lugg, then what is she going to do with Hades?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Let us talk of Emet-Selch.” The red-masked Ancient said, everyone looking to her beloved."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hythlodaeus said that Emet told you about my memories so I thought it would be obvious to you three that I wouldn’t be able to kill him.” Lightly brushing through Hades’ hair, Aestelle looked down at Hades with a troubled expression."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You know what’s wrong with Emet?” “Unlike her soul and the halfmen of these shards Emet-Selch had told us of, he is an Unsundered meaning his soul is far more resilient than the rest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle brushed through Hades’ hair one more time before pulling away and giving the three shades her full attention."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “A familiar imbued with darkness from a number of individuals and subsequently having that darkness passed onto Emet-Selch should more than suffice the amount needed for his soul to begin repairing itself.” The reason it’s taken so long for these three to come visiting you and Hades is because they’ve been keeping tabs on your companions."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I’m sure they only came to take Hades away.” They  were the ones who tried to use the white auracite against Hades!” She said as her frustrations only grew."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Can’t you, can’t one of you create this familiar and save Hades?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I don’t know who to trust anymore or how to help Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch is our creator and we certainly act on the will he instilled within each of us, yet that does not detract from the honest bonds we once shared with you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Each of us wish nothing but the best for you and Emet-Selch so please, do not fear that you are alone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I don’t deserve for you to be so kind to me… Emet told you how it was me who killed you three, didn’t he?” She asked, her voice wavering."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ultimately, it was Elidibus who convinced both Emet-Selch and I to leave you in your sundered state for if our mission to bring back our world failed, only you could be entrusted to see these vain reflections to a brighter future."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “As much as I want to stand here all evening and listen to you both give her the pep-talk of the century, time is ever moving forward and she must needs reconcile with her companions if she’s to save Emet-Selch before his soul gives out.” Nabriales said blandly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch would have done well to only create Lahabrea and I. I’m afraid if you want to save Emet, then you have no choice but to speak with your friends again.” Hythlodaeus then said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh, that crystal fellow Emet-Selch brought here first?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ‘Twas apparent to him that Emet-Selch had little to no intention of returning to Amaurot alive and all but demanded to know the truth of the ending the Architect had already envisioned.” Igeyorhm said only for Lahabrea to sigh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I didn’t think it difficult to guess what Emet-Selch had in mind for his epic finale to our legacy.” The Speaker scoffed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Though Emet wasn’t prepared for her to regain her memories let alone find a solution to Zodiark’s corruption."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I do not doubt that Emet-Selch would have traded everything to return life to as it once was, though he knew nothing he or any other on the Convocation did could achieve just that so he instead placed his lot with yours."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Through you, Emet-Selch has shaped the Source into a world capable of protecting itself and has personally overseen your rebirth countless times over in order to make certain that you grew into the steward these stars need.” You have triumphed over him and thus proven to Emet-Selch that you and the rest of these mortals are now worthy of looking after themselves with you acting as their first and most reliant line of defense.” Hades truly went above and beyond in recreating them… She’ll have to ask why it is he created them this time around once he wakes up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her eyes shifted from the shades back to Hades, his soft breaths doing little to ease her worry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Crawling over to be at his side once more, she leaned down and kissed his cheek, Hades still fast asleep."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This has far surpassed what she lived through previously and has diverged from that timeline entirely, the future where Hades is concerned wholly unknown."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Just because Halone and the Twelve don’t want Hades to die doesn’t mean they can stop fate from stealing him away again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With Igeyorhm’s help, Aestelle hopped down from the bed and left Hades behind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But, she’s glad to see they’re really going to stay and watch over Hades while she ventures off to find a way to save him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I don't know but I find it kinda sad that this entire chapter is virtually Aestelle talking with non-living recreations of the dead people she feels most guilty for their deaths all the while Emet is zonked out and still sleeping his days away lol like her finding it comforting to speak with the shades reminds me of Sasori from Naruto where he created his puppets in the image of his deceased parents to try and cure his loneliness ;-; Makes me wonder if in-game Emet went ham on recreating Amaurot and filling it with all of the Ancients and things as partially his way of coping with the loneliness and *okay now I'm making myself sad fuuuuu* Hades was floating nearby in the rift, watching her from the safety of the shadows but purposefully remaining close enough that she could sense him even in her fractured state."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She knew he’d be fine so she focused her attention solely on her mission to save Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Unlike Thancred and Urianger who were most definitely at the forefront of the plan to carry on with killing Hades, G’raha seemed reluctant to follow suit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He was also the one Hades trusted most given that he spoke to him about her...so that must count for something."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What does she say to G’raha after running away with Hades and being gone for almost an entire week now?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades and Elidibus’ lives depend on her succeeding and failure is not an option."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “They gave me their word that they would help me save Emet only to plot to kill him so why should I believe you?” I promised that if Emet wasn’t able to be saved that  I  would be the one to kill him and yet you each still felt it just to go behind my back and scheme against my own plans."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “In their defense, it was I who told Urianger of the Eighth Umbral Calamity and unintentionally planted the seeds that only by Emet-Selch’s death could the First and the Source be spared into his mind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I will say that Ryne and I both opposed Urianger’s plans to carry forth with Emet-Selch’s execution.” Y’shtola said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This entire time I’ve been saying that Emet has never been our enemy and I meant it.” Emet and the other Ascians have killed millions, ended entire worlds, and have sown the seeds of chaos everywhere they have ever walked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If you can think rationally when talking about me, then why can’t you do the same for Emet?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Emet came to realize that what Zodiark wanted─to bring back our world─it would never work, so he started devising his own plan to put an end to this cycle of Warriors of Light fighting against the evil Ascians and to put an end to this suffering."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet clearly changed and began to truly view us sundered as life worth investing in!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If you both can look past my own shortcomings─my  failures  in favor of praising me for all of the good I have done, then why can’t you afford the same fair judgment to Emet?” Emet deserves a chance to live the life he shouldn’t have ever had to lose when he selflessly gave up his all to summon Zodiark forth along with our brethren."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And it’s for this reason that I must ask you both to consider looking past the Ascian named Emet-Selch and instead look to the man underneath named Hades.” She said, stopping once she was standing in front of both her friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You know now the truth of mine and his motives, and you know that Emet and I want nothing more than to see that life lives on even in this sundered state."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I will always be an ally to the First and the Source, but I have to do what’s right for Emet and I."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If you and the others can’t let bygones be bygones and honestly put aside your disdain and help me save him, then just tell me that when I return from the Source and I’ll leave with Emet.” “I will endeavor to sway their opinions over Emet-Selch as well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Time isn’t favoring you guys any more than it is Emet I see…” She murmured before shifting her attention to the Exarch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “‘Shtola, Ryne, can I trust you both to talk with the others on my behalf and convince them to help save Emet?” Aestelle asked, glancing between the two girls."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet has saved both Y’shtola and Alisaie, and I for one want to show him all of the wonderful things us sundered are capable of!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No matter what, I promise to convince Urianger and Thancred that Emet can stay with us and even become a Scion.” “A Scion, Emet-Selch?” She repeated."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet is still sleeping back in his recreation of our home so when I do make it back, I’ll be heading there not long after I speak with everyone and hopefully I’ll be able to bring him back here for Beq Lugg to help me with his condition.” What exactly has happened to Emet-Selch following your triumphant battle?” Once everyone is back, we can have a conversation explaining to them Emet-Selch and Aestelle’s situation and hopefully move forward with the plan to save him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Just you watch, Emet will be welcome here with us in no time at all!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It would be churlish of me to deny you this, and I genuinely wish to see eye-to-eye on matters with Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The last part of his words are lost as the hum of the portal gently beckons her onto the rivers of aether, whisking her off back to the Source to begin the encore Hades never thought he’d be given."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ah, now that Emet is zonked out asleep, we get downtime for me to panic set up plot for later chapters (don't mind me having a mental breakdown over trying to figure out how to juggle the Eden raids + Werlyt Chronicles + role quests and the Thirteenth :3) These are the moments I wish I would have preplanned like, a month in advance because I'm just thinking of all the things I want to include in this fic and questioning how the actual hell I'm supposed to somehow write it all in without either dragging on the story to the point it's a bore to read through or risking the possibility of making a confusing and convoluted plot that could all become a bunch of jumbled nonsense lmao send help my brain is imploding."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of everyone she would consider a true potential ally to her, Elidibus, and Hades, it would be him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “An expected development indeed, though I thought it a development Hydaelyn’s champion would overlook in her celebration of a triumphant victory over Emet-Selch.” Elidibus responded."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You did not eradicate Emet-Selch as you have our brethren before him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’re gifted with the same sight as Emet so surely you can take a guess.” “I’ve come to fulfill my duty to the Convocation, saving Emet the first step in my plan to do just that.” Whether or not he’s still in there beneath all of Zodiark’s influence is something she’ll have to ask Hades for his opinion over when he wakes up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet needs me and so does the rest of the Convocation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hydaelyn tried to strip me of it because of my intention to save Emet only for an old friend of mine to come to my rescue before I died to the Light."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I’m not giving up on you just as I didn’t give up on Emet.” You who have slain our brothers for their selfless acts in service to Lord Zodiark and have gone so far as to take Emet-Selch onto a path entirely your own, your selfishness knows no bounds."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Once you have been dealt with, Emet-Selch will return to his role as Architect and all will continue onwards as though you and yours never interfered with our great work."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet showed me what it is I was forgetting, and I will not forsake my duty for a second time, Elidibus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I’m sure Emet wouldn’t mind me sharing our history either so let’s go take a seat by the fire and I’ll start from the beginning.” I'm so happy to begin writing for him like this is where everything starts following the msq while also altering the hell out of it because of Emet and just :'))) I'm excited to keep writing.~ And we also got the smol bab Unukalhai ;-; He's precious and you can bet money Aestelle is adopting him and Taynor without question xD It's going to be especially fun to write Emet having interactions with all of these characters once he's awake."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet is alone in his recreation of our home and Elidibus could be anywhere right about now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If it’s all the same to you, I’m going to bring Emet back to stay in my suite within the Pendants and then I’ll come back here to talk with everyone.” Emet isn’t physically hurt and he’d just be taking up a bed that could be used for someone who needs it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Now, hm, I wonder if I can do the same kind of teleportations Emet and Elidibus use...” Hades and Elidibus and the other Ascians make it look so effortless to summon portals of their own...she’s going to have to practice before she can do this with as much ease as them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her eyes linger on the large doors of the capitol for a moment longer and then she starts down the street towards her and Hades’ apartment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lahabrea walked to sit on the edge of the bed opposite of her and Hades, looking down upon the two smaller individuals while Aestelle crawls to sit at her lovers’ side, her hands already holding one of his."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She held Hades' hand to her cheek, trying to warm him as best she could as she takes in his appearance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her heart fell in her chest as she looked at Hades with nothing short of worry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My beloved Hades...I wish I could fix this mess on my own…” ‘Twould appear our hypothesis was correct and you, Azem, are the lifeline keeping Emet-Selch here in the world of the living and preventing his soul from giving out.” “Let us focus on Emet-Selch for the time being."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But that in and of itself poses a problem if she is indeed needed to go and beseech the aid of the one who can yet save Emet-Selch.” “Just as Emet-Selch has said time and time again, it is not your job to be the strong one all of the time.” Lahabrea reminded."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What if they still insist that Emet must die and refuse to help me?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “For Emet’s sake, I hope you’re right… I should bring him back to the Crystarium.” She said, looking from her lover to her friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We are but shades brought into existence for the purpose of supporting you in Emet-Selch’s absence, nothing more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Not when we’re stuck with each other here for the rest of our days so long as Emet-Selch refuses for the incantation to fade.” Igeyorhm then sighed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Our existences may not be the most extraordinary in the grand scope of this sundered world’s history, but it is Emet’s wish that this city was created to act as a living memory for you to ever find a home in─and we are but an extension of that wish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Our memory will live on in this recreation of our remembered home, and it shall serve as a reminder that though we are not truly alive, we yet live on through you and Emet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We both know that Emet will need you to be there for him when he awakes and Elidibus is no better."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “No matter how long you and Emet may be away, you will always be an Amaurotine and esteemed members of the Convocation of Fourteen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Walk forward with your head held high, and do keep Emet from dragging everyone down into his ocean of never-ending sadness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And I’m sure Emet and I could give them a real good show with all of the more exquisite and unique creations we have stored in our Bureau.” Hythlodaeus said happily and then looked back down to Aestelle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I’ll be sure to give you, Emet, and Elidibus a fitting welcome once everything has calmed down again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It must be because Hades created each of you as perfect copies of your once-living counterparts.” Aestelle said with a small smile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Then ‘twould seem Hades’ creations have served their purpose perfectly.” He said, chuckling to himself while he stretches an arm high above his head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Could you attempt to open up a portal to where you intend to let Hades rest?” She wasn’t given a chance to respond before Hythlodaeus was turning his attention to her and enveloping both herself and Hades in her own aether, pulling the portal to carry them across the rift."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The time spent traveling is no more than a few seconds and then the currents of aether are gently setting her down onto her bed within the Pendants, Hades lying down beside her just as he was back in their apartment in Amaurot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades…” She whispered his name as she reached down to brush through his white hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That Hades had simply gone and cut his hair on a whim."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There’s no chance that she’s going to head all the way up to the Ocular just to talk with her friends when Hythlodaeus and the others warned her that leaving Hades' side can be dangerous."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Grabbing the nearby chair the second she returned to her room, she pulled it over to sit right beside her bed and held Hades’ hand that’s closest to her, gently running her thumb over the backs of his knuckles while she waits for her friends to show up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus was right, the dark circles under Hades’ eyes are worse than usual."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle didn’t spare so much as a glance away from Hades as she said a short “come in”."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Is that...Emet-Selch?” Alphinaud asked as him, Ryne, and Alisaie took hesitant steps closer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “My friend, we have told the others of your plight and have discussed the matter concerning Emet-Selch at great length."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Go ahead.” She responded softly, keeping her attention fixed on Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I erred greatly and allowed myself to naively believe that only by Emet-Selch’s death wouldst the First be delivered unto salvation...and I admit, I didst not believeth in thine unproven solution to his tempering."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What hast been done cannot be undone, mine actions wrongfully carried out, but I do beg leave to return to thy side and aid thee in thine quest to save Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch was prepared to die by your hands to ensure humanity lived on, and no matter how much I loath the bastard I can’t deny that an action such as that alone deserves a chance to make right on his wrongs.” For this, I am sorry and, like my fellow Scions, I would be glad to assist with your efforts to save Emet-Selch and even Elidibus should a way be thought possible.” “I failed you in your hour of need and forced your hand into running away… I doubted your ability to separate yourself from your past in order to do whatever had to be done and thought that if Emet-Selch could not be saved, it would fall to us to kill him in your stead so your hands would not be stained with his blood."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And we are also all in agreement that Emet-Selch should be given a second chance at life just as you have been given through the Great Sundering."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She remained quiet as she held Hades' hand and watched him sleep."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I understand why you did it, I honestly do...but I think right now actions will truly speak louder than words and if you want to make things right, then I ask you help me save Emet and Elidibus.” Aestelle said softly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I will always love each of you and I will always be a Scion─but before I was a Scion I was Azem and even before that, I was Emet and Elidibus’ friend."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Once Emet is awake again, I’ll speak with him on what he thinks we should do."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle let out a small laugh as she turned in her chair to better see her friends while still holding Hades’ hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Beq Lugg can help us with figuring out the finer details to soul preservation and transference─after he’s helped me save Emet, that is.” But Emet’s condition worsens the further I’m away from him so I have to stay behind this time and leave this task to you all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Once Emet is awake and we’ve started looking into how to get you all back home where you belong I’ll rest.” Just, promise me no more using the white auracite against Emet or Elidibus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus is already here on the First and now that I have Emet in my care, there’s no telling when he might show up─especially if I’m not there to deter him from picking a fight.” Aestelle said, glancing to Hades for a moment before looking to the twins and G’raha once more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I know I’m stressing how much Emet means to me, but you each mean the world and more to me as well so please, don’t do anything reckless."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle exhaled a soft sigh, returning her gaze to Hades as she continues to hold his hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We’re almost there, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A pretty long chapter full of nothing but dialogue but I swear it's important for the story to keep going xD Next chapter I promise to give some wholesome Emet time (don't ask me how I'll manage this because I haven't thought that far ahead but so help me god I want more Emet lol) On the bright side, Aestelle is kinda okay with the Scions again and Elidibus is soon to really join in on the mayhem that is this fic so don't get too used to this chill somber vibes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Feo Ul comes to the rescue and offers Aestelle a chance to help turn Hades' nightmare into a pleasant dream."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Minutes turn into hours and Aestelle has yet to leave Hades side, patiently sitting in the same chair she has been for nearly an entire day now while she watches over him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Maybe that’s a simple fact of life and no one can truly do everything on their own─especially the larger-than-life tasks both herself and Hades have decided to burden all by their lonesome."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Saving Hades, saving this world and the Source, stopping the Final Days, all of it was never possible for her to achieve on her own and it’s frustrating."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Bah, I can’t stay angry with you…” They groaned, letting their head hang for a moment as they flutter in the air just over Hades before looking up with a warm smile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades and I fought and when I used the Light to strike through to his soul and rid him of the Darkness that took ahold of him, it nearly shattered him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I don’t think that will work with Hades, Feo Ul…” Aestelle said sadly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Flying around, Feo Ul stopped over Hades once more and pointed at her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The ruins of Amaurot greet her with that same quiet that they did when she found herself plunged into Hades’ memory of the immediate aftermath of the Great Sundering."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Clearly Feo Ul did some Fae magick and managed to throw her into Hades’ dream, but there’s no telling what they meant by calling this dream a terrible one."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She needs to find Hades before something bad happens."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades has to be nearby and if he’s still calling her name then she wants to stay quiet to listen for him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How did Hades, Lahabrea, and Elidibus ever manage to make it through this on their own?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How long has Hades been in this nightmarish dream of his?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could have been here for years already or only a few hours."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades is the only one capable of saving them both now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Capitol is but a ruined set of metal framework in the distance and she can’t see Hades walking all the way there in its current state so he has to still be around here somewhere."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle suddenly goes flying down to the ground, her foot catching on a large slab of stone in her haste to find Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She’s been walking aimlessly for what feels like hours already and she hasn’t heard Hades even once."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What will happen to Hades if his nightmares consume him?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She won’t give up just as Hades never gave up on her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She turned around fully just in time for Hades to bend down and wrap her up in a tight embrace, his hold on her deathly tight to the point his embrace hurts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’m here, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh thank the heavens.” Hades exhaled a sigh of relief as he pulled back a little further to really look down at her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades, this is a dream… You do know that, don’t you?” She asked, placing her hands on his chest and looking up at him, another building falling a little ways away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I...I didn’t survive the real Great Sundering Hades…” But that was the past, Hades, and this is no more than a dream and I am here now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It’s  your  dream, Hades.” Hades seems to know that just as well as she does, his gaze flicking past her for a moment only to refocus on her the moment he sees another beast."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The screams and cries that haunt even her own nightmares from the Final Days are beginning to resound, cries for salvation echoing off of the ruins and only causing Hades to tighten his hold on her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Think, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades is here and she believes he’ll spirit them away to a place far far away from this nightmare that was once their home."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Clear skies with a few clouds roll by greeting them as Hades slowly releases her from his embrace in favor of grabbing her hand and interlacing their fingers as he too takes in the change in scenery."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You grew up in a city with no connections to magick, no disputes with nearby towns, and was generally loved by all.” Hades' expression fell into a scowl."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades slowly nodded."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You saved us both, Hades, and now I can save you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “The real us.” Hades repeated as he began walking after her with a small smile ghosting over his lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Aestelle?” Hades said her name, panic clearly rising as he starts walking quickly towards her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I have to go Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her smile wavered some while a tear managed to slip down her cheek, Hades no more than a few fulms away from her now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In an attempt to hold her one last time, Hades lunged forward only for Aestelle to disappear right as he managed to wrap his arms around her small frame."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A bit of a shorter chapter (or at least it feels like it is since it's centered around Hades lul) but I think this is probably one of my more favorite chapters I've written so far."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" it doesn't have too much going on but the things Hades says tell *a lot* into the past that hasn't really been explained too much from his pov."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I dunno, I could also just be biased and because we got cute Emet time this turned into one of my fave chapters as well xD In a daze, Aestelle slowly opens her eyes and finds that she had fallen asleep in her chair, resting her upper body on the bed while Hades continues to sleep."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Was all of that a dream..?” Aestelle whispered to herself, looking at Hades for a moment longer before standing up and stretching."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I am not as young as I used to be and the thought of wearing armor again is tiring on it’s own.” She sighed, shaking her head before shifting her gaze to the large bed Hades is currently sleeping in."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Alright, I’ll help with the last of the hunts once Emet is awake.” “Emet?” Cyella repeated, glancing over her shoulder back towards the bed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “As in Emet-Selch?” She then asked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch was nothing more than a name tossed around by Mitron and Loghrif during their brief meetings with me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “The important thing is that Emet has been working to help me grow stronger so I could save the remaining shards."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He’s just, Emet.” Aestelle turned on her stool to look back at Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But why prohibit Emet-Selch from fighting if he is now going to be fighting for the salvation of this world instead of its ruination?” Cyella asked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not to mention I have no idea if Elidibus or any other Ascian for that matter can revert what I’ve done to Emet and somehow make him a thrall to Zodiark yet again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “A valid concern...but if Elidibus intends to put his plans into action soon then we may need Emet-Selch despite the risks.” Cyella murmured."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It makes sense that there would be other survivors from that dark world, but it’s still shocking to think that a survivor would be this close and already leery of the current Ascian movements taking place so soon after Hades’ defeat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades, this is getting out of hand.” Aestelle sighed as she walked back over to her bed and took a seat on the edge after pushing the chair away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What if he can’t be saved, Hades..?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I have seen enough of our family die, so, please don’t make me kill him Hades…\"  Hades stops walking down the halls of the Bureau of the Architect and promptly whips around to glare at the white-robed man following after him from behind his blood red mask."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch, must I remind you why it is we have become something akin to friends in these recent decades?”  Without a word Hades kept walking, nearing his office at the end of the long hallway."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades threw open the door to his office and didn’t bother closing it behind him knowing full well the Emissary will follow after him regardless of if he managed to lock him out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You have this institution to look over, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" !” Hades snapped as he turned to look at the white-robed man."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus removed his mask as well, letting it rest against his hip as he looks to Hades with slightly knitted brows."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Do not tell me what she would and would not do.” Hades cut him off with a bite to his words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades scoffed, looking off to the side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With narrowed eyes, Hades returned his gaze to the other man."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades frowned."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And why do you get to make this decision?” Hades asked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For a moment, Hades just stared at the man before him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades turning around to do the same."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Why won’t you just admit that you love her?” Hades asked without removing his eyes from Amaurot’s skyline, the malice in his words gone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades groaned as he reached up to lightly smack his hand to his forehead and then pull down on his cheeks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This family is what I wish to protect─and that does sadly include you, Emet.”  “Don’t make me sick.” Hades scoffed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “The perfect couple.” Hades responded with a laugh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades waved him off."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I will be leaving you to your work, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Are you positive about this..?” Hades asked just loud enough for him to hear, Elidibus stopping with his hand on the door handle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I entrust the safekeeping of our family to you, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Do not disappoint me.” The white-robed man responded and then left the large office, Hades remaining at the window and staring out at their shining city."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What a fool... Hades said to himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Once my house is completely finished I'll go ahead and drop my address for anyone wanting to stop by since a fair amount of ya are on Aether\/ Siren as well ^^ I'm going for an Amaurot\/ Eden Raid themed house and you can bet money that the first thing you'll see when you walk in is my Hades statue lmao I have no regrets x3 Also if you see me in a roulette or just out and about, feel free to shoot me a whisper and say hi!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After having everyone return from the Grand Cosmos with Beq Lugg to help her in creating a familiar capable of saving Hades, Aestelle anxiously waits to see if Lahabrea's plan will work... Did she love Elidibus as she did Hades and just never noticed it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She was certain that Hades was the only man for her… Though she isn’t naive enough to try and pretend like her memories are exactly restored to any large degree so there very well may be something big she’s still forgetting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There was never anyone else for her other than Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The life I once lived with Emet and the Convocation was...I don’t even know how to describe it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It’s just, well when you really think about it, Emet is immortal and so was I once."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It’s something I doubt Emet has learned to appreciate just yet considering his only goal was to bring about the Rejoining or have me kill him...but someday I hope he can appreciate how beautiful even an ephemeral existence can be."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Now there isn’t enough time to do much of anything in comparison to the lives you and Emet-Selch once lived.” I pray that Emet-Selch may one day adopt that same mentality."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Speaking of Emet-Selch,” he paused as he glanced over to her bed where said Ascian is still sleeping soundly, “how has he been in our absence?” “I wonder what it is Emet-Selch will do once he is awake now that he is free from Zodiark’s influence."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Well, I for one would not mind suffering Emet-Selch’s company."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A calm silence fell around them as G’raha turned his attention back out the window while Aestelle kept her eyes fixated on Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Now, onto your current and most pressing problem…” Their voice trailed off as all three of their gazes shifted over to Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Allow me to introduce you to Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But I’m no expert at all in these things which is why I asked for you to come and help us with both Emet and finding a way to bring my friends home.” Placing a hand to their chin, Beq Lugg looked at Hades and then closed their eyes as they thought over her words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet’s still sleeping and that’s about it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “How are these butterflies then connected to you and Emet-Selch?” “That night when I returned to Amaurot, I found out that this idiot of a man had taken on the role of Emet-Selch in my absence and wasn’t planning on telling me himself.” Aestelle recounted as she hurried to finish up the left wing, wanting nothing more than to save Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Cupping her hands together, Aestelle let the morpho land in her palms and then slowly stood up to sit down on the edge of her bed once more beside Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “So all that’s left is for me to shift this aether into Darkness and then reintroduce it to Emet, right?” She asked, looking to Beq Lugg for confirmation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her aether pours over the small creation, Hades' own reacting to help her focus on bringing out the Darkness from her friends' aether while quelling all the other elements present."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She smiles to herself as the morpho takes off from her hand and flutters over to Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Now all that’s left is to pray…” Aestelle said softly, reaching to take Hades' hand into her own while the morpho slowly descends to land on his chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle opens her eyes and holds Hades' hand up to her cheek, watching him for even the slightest signs that he might be waking up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades did not wake up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If Hades is to wake, then she doesn’t want him to wake up alone, and she leaves it at that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle’s eyes slowly go wide when she comes face to face with Hades who has propped himself up on one elbow to lie on his side, a hand outstretched and grasping at her hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You’ve been asleep for so long Hades I-” Cute chapter yada yada love Hades, the usual lmao I just want to say that I'm so sorry this chapter took this long to be published ;-; Real life kinda went to hell for a week and then some and I didn't have any time to write or edit or really come online but I'm hoping from this point forward I can at the very least stick to updating once a week."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Apologies out of the way, this chapter was both fun and hell to write lol I have rewritten it at least three times in the last two days of me trying to post this and I'm still not sure I like how it turned out xD But, the story must go on and I don't hate this iteration so really, it's as good as it's getting I think ;-; I'm just happy Hades is awake again xD More cute times are ahead and most definitely more feels :3 Because after watching the 6.0 trailer and seeing our lord and savior Lahabread making a comeback, something tells me I'm not going to be able to end this story at 5.4 anymore xD I'm leaning more towards finding a good ending point with Emet's story arc with Aestelle and then picking up the story in a second book where we get Elidibus + Eden Raids lore (along with more side things ofc like role\/ void quests and the Werlyt chronicles)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With Hades awake, Aestelle isn't given a moment to rest before she along with her love are being asked to journey back to the Source before helping with restoring the Empty."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades, I know I found you clothes to change into and all, but you should really rest for a little while longer!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle bit her lip, Hades holding her hand and leading her through the Exedra and past the main Aetheryte of the Crystarium."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though she couldn’t quite shake her own unease at how quickly Hades has bounced back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her eyes widen ever so slightly as they step out into the Rotunda and Hades takes a second to run his free hand through his white hair as a cool night breeze blows past, a smile ghosting over his lips and all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “How are you though, my beloved Hades?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Must you talk about him so soon after our reunion?” Hades cut her off, his tone colder in an instant."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle stopped once she set foot on the top platform of the watchtower, Hades being forced to stop as well after she lightly pulled on his hand and prevented him from walking further."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Tugging her along, Hades led her to the edge of the platform and pointed out to the seemingly endless lilac forest that is Lakeland."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You can’t be serious Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades...you can’t mean that.” She said with her smile faltering."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I’m not asking you to forsake our home, Hades, but I am asking for you to give these worlds a chance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her beloved Hades finally holding and kissing and caring for her as she always wanted him to from the moment she learned the truth of their history and fate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though it appears you both simply wished to enjoy the night air, so my apologies.” The miqo’te woman said only for the younger girl’s cheeks to go red, Hades still holding her firmly by the waist and looking at Y’shtola with a bored expression."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades…” Aestelle whispered his name warningly while she lightly pulled on the small strands of his hair at the nape of his neck."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades reluctantly released Aestelle from his embrace in favor of holding just one of her hands."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle watched her friend go for a moment and was then giggling to herself as she leaned into Hades once again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ours?” Hades repeated."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades let out a long and heavy sigh but didn’t respond as they made their way past the large doors of the Tower and began the lengthy ascent up the spire."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades is alive and anything that comes to pose a problem for them from this point forward cannot possibly be more troublesome than the hell she and him went through to make it this far."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Do you remember what it is you asked me?” Hades suddenly spoke up as they slowly walked through Amon’s room, the vibrant red of the walls a stark contrast to the crystalline blue of the Tower."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Pausing for a moment, Hades shook his head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades shrugged as they neared the doors to the Ocular, the long crystalline staircase up to the top of the Tower stretching out behind them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Thank you for coming on such short notice and I will be the first to apologize for calling upon you both so soon after your recovery, Emet-Selch.” G’raha said from where he stands in his usual spot in front of his large glowing mirror, the other Scions standing opposite of him and looking to the two new arrivals with small smiles."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Or, in Thancred’s case, a disapproving scowl while he watches Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Looks as though someone’s ego hasn’t quite recovered from being swatted out of the air like some fly during my battle with my dearly beloved.” Hades scoffed as he returned Thancred’s cold stare with a cocky smirk of his own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Make amends?” Hades repeated only for Aestelle to squeeze his hand again in a vain attempt at reminding him to be cordial with the others."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a shrug, Hades flicked his gaze down to Aestelle for a moment before refocusing his attention on Thancred."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sighing, Hades shook his head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “He says that, but I’m not going to just let him leave and return to the Convocation so leave Emet in my care.” “I do not need you to look after me.” Hades said blandly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And now with Hades here, who knows what might happen?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Thou wouldst not happen to be in possession of knowledge as to thine colleagues' plans, wouldst thee, Emet-Selch?” Urianger asked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades glanced to him with a wry smile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I trust you will watch over our dear friend, Emet-Selch?” Hades smiled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Before Thancred could speak up again, Aestelle yanked on Hades' hand and started for the crystalline mirror."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But the same goes for you and Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Already being sent off to be used as pawns, how dull.” Hades sighed under his breath."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I would not waste it if I were you, Emet-Selch.” G’raha said softly, lifting his hand to touch the mirror only for its cerulean glow to brighten."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" See you upon your return.” Y’shtola then said, offering Aestelle and Hades a wave before turning to head for the doors to the Ocular."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Waving him off, Hades stepped foot into the portal and tugged Aestelle along with him, both of them walking hand in hand into their first of what she hopes to be many more adventures to come."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" xD And poor Emet has to go along with her rip But don't worry, there will be some nice moments with just them two ^^ So I've been thinking and yeah, I'm going to try and end this story soon-ish and will immediately start up a second one once I figure out a nice stopping point for this story and can continue into the next :3 Don't worry, I know I said I want to focus more on Elidibus and a lot of the Eden raid things in the next story, but ultimately this is a fic about Aestelle and Emet and that isn't going to change even with Elidibus and the other Ascians showing up to cause trouble lul I just really want to have more relationships outside of only focusing on Aestelle and Emet is all (because let's be real, she was most definitely close with most of the members on the Convocation and I really need to add more moments with her and the Scions too like *there's not enough time for me to write everything I desperately want to write*) Bringing Hades to her home in Ishgard, Aestelle finds herself sitting on the floor and curled up into his side while they sit in front of the fireplace with mugs of hot chocolate, backs against the couch and sharing only small portions of what their time apart has been like since the Great Sundering."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “This cold is almost as bad as Garlemald’s.” Hades all but hissed as him and Aestelle walked side by side through the snowy streets of Ishgard, his hold on her hand never falling since they made it here to the Source."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “The Exarch and your friends sure didn’t waste a moment in sending you off to do their bidding.” Hades scoffed only for her to push her shoulder into his arm as her way of half attempting to hit him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Varis…” Aestelle murmured under her breath before shifting her attention back up at Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was hard for her to grasp the sudden realization that Hades, her beloved Hades who had vowed to love her and only her for the rest of their days, was betrothed to another and even had a child with this other mystery woman."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Were they happy and did Hades forget that she herself existed so he could be with this other woman?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You could say that, yes.” Hades murmured."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Before Hades had a chance to respond, a man called out to the pair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked the man up and down as he walked up to them, the elezen paying him no mind initially."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I was actually buying some more Coerthan tea leaves when I chanced upon your name and wanted to see if indeed our savior had returned.” The Count paused for a moment as he glanced to Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Lover, actually.” Aestelle helpfully supplied, her smile only widening when Hades and Edmont both looked down at her in surprise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle giggled some while Hades struggled to find an answer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades rolled his eyes at her and then looked to the elezen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet is fine I suppose."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I know Haurchefant would find a way to curse me from the grave should either you or Emet here grow sick from this weather.” Nice meeting you Emet and I look forward to talking with you when next time allows."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Goodbye you two.” And with that, Lord Edmont turned to head back the way he came, leaving Aestelle and Hades there to watch him disappear back down the alleyway."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Smacking his free hand over his mouth, Hades pulled down on his cheeks and sighed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Is that your way of saying you worry about me?” She teased only for Hades to sigh yet again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Rather advanced for a city of closed-off elezen who recently came off a thousand-year war against dragons of all beasts.” Hades noted while she pulled him inside and finally out from the cold that’s been nipping at them since they first arrived at the main Aetheryte."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A hand landed over hers from behind, causing her to jump as Hades leans over to place his chin down onto her shoulder."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Not a bad memory…” Aestelle whispered softly, pulling the cocoa powder jar to her and then reaching over to the nearby kettle, Hades making himself comfortable and wrapping his arms now around her stomach to keep her in place."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Is this yet another man I have to listen to you fawn over?” Hades sighed, though there was no malice in his words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A smile tugged on her lips as she managed to shuffle over to the sink to wash the kettle all while Hades continued to hug her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Judging by yours and Lord Edmont’s words, this man has since perished.” Hades murmured, his arms around her stomach tightening ever so slightly to hug her as best he can."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She reached behind her to pull the second pillow down as well, not wanting to leave Hades without a spot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You have a perfectly suitable couch right there─but fine, if you insist.” Hades sighed, a ghost of a smile dancing across his lips as he hands her their mugs of hot chocolate and then takes a seat beside her, grabbing the blanket and wrapping it around his shoulders for them to now share."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh?” Hades said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’ arm around her shoulders pulled her a little closer as she curled up into his side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle pushed herself harder into Hades’ side, trying to not slip back into the memories that haunt her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She bit her lip and squeezed her eyes shut even tighter, holding her mug of hot chocolate to her chest as she brings her knees up to curl in on herself while Hades continues to hold her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades used his free hand to take a drink of his hot chocolate, humming as he thought of a response."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He didn’t even care when Igeyorhm died right beside him─Igeyorhm, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He was no longer the academic we knew.” Hades paused as he took another sip of his hot chocolate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Polar opposites.” Hades agreed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She turned her gaze from Hades and back to the flickering fire."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What?” Hades asked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You do not possess nearly enough primordial Light to create a blade potent enough to strike through and detemper him.” Hades said blandly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Let us first worry ourselves with the present.” Hades cut her off."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Okay Hades and Aestelle being so damn domestic is what I've been *dying* to write for since literally chapter one and now that we're finally here, ugh, I'm going to have so much fun writing for this disgustingly adorable couple."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I've been thinking a lot about how their dynamic is going to change as more Ascians are brought into the story (our lord and savior Lahabread especially) and I'm getting more and more excited thinking about how I’m going to change up the msq storyline now that Emet is alive."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Like can you imagine how next chapter is going to go when Aestelle and him go to speak with Gaius and Raubahn like fjkldas;jfk And god forbid the Black Wolf recognizes Emet or he says something stupid to give away that yup, he's the late Emperor and an Ascian to top things off :') Emet is going to get himself killed confirmed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All of that is to say I'm going to have a blast altering events and dialogue to fit Emet and Aestelle into this storyline :D (now if only I could somehow write more moments with the Scions smh I need to make a spin-off book of just stupid random oneshot things that happen away from Aestelle because hot damn Hades would probably pick fights with everyone when she isn't around xD)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We gotta see how Emet and Aestelle navigate this mess with the Ruby Weapon since she knows about the true nature behind these weapons and the fate of their pilots ;-; (she's gonna say something to Gaius, calling it now oml) Having Hades speak with the Black Wolf himself really could have gone much, much worse and Aestelle is just happy another attempt on his life wasn't made."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Shaking her head, Aestelle tried to remember all it is the Fury said to her and Ardbert in their brief meeting before her fight against Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Everything following from her battle against Hades to fleeing from the Scions and somehow making it to where they are now never exactly allowed her much time to reflect on her talk with Halone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But because of how both her and Hades tried desperately to save Amaurot, the few gods who have been watching over them decided to grant them their aid and turned back the hands of time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Only those on the Convocation know what the Final Days were truly like and none save for herself and Hades can remember it with such clarity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There’s no possible way for the Final Days to come about again unless herself or Hades worked to throw the world into such chaos."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even after saving Hades, things aren’t alright in the least."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades is at least around again to help her where he can, though he alone can’t replace the twelve others they’re yet missing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The path before you has yet to change and now that Emet-Selch is here to walk alongside you, the Convocation has naught to worry over for our fate and history is in good hands.” Leaving the cathedral behind, Aestelle started down the nearby stairs and began weaving through the alleyways of the Jeweled Crozier towards her home where she left Hades sleeping peacefully on the couch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had told her that despite their sundered brethren following the path Zodiark had set them on, it was clear for him, Lahabrea, and Elidibus to see that they aren’t nearly as determined to honor their dark god as they once were."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And of all the Ascians to be given such freedom, of course Fandaniel would be among them─the most controversial and problematic member on the Convocation by far (more so than herself even) and judging by what Hades told her of him, he hasn’t changed a bit for the better and has somehow gotten worse in his manipulative ways and psychotic behavior since the Great Sundering."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “H-Hades!” Aestelle gasped only to giggle some after the initial shock had passed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You will have to forgive me for thinking this all to be some cruel dream I will awake from, my dear.” Hades said with a ghost of a smile dancing across his lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ‘Tis not a courtesy to give me a false sense of hope.” Hades murmured, leaning down to place a kiss to the top of her head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I can’t fail him, Hades.” She said as she looked up at her beloved."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades expression fell as she slipped out of his embrace with ease."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Honestly, it’s a miracle your friends on the First never cornered you into revealing just how it is you and you alone are privy to information that you have no way of coming into possession of.” Hades voice trailed from the living room."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle paused just short of biting her small piece of bread, her eyes glued on the door to the kitchen Hades has yet to walk through."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She had asked Hades if maybe he shouldn’t be seen for these kinds of meetings given his history with the Garlean Empire, though after talking on the way to the conference room, they both agreed that this might be the best time to have him begin getting involved in her more conflict heavy affairs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though she can only hope Gaius doesn’t follow Thancred’s example and attempt to shoot Hades the moment he realizes who he is."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Tightening her hold on Hades’ hand, Aestelle exhaled a small sigh and then nodded to the guards to open the doors to the conference room, her lover not looking nearly as anxious as herself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I had sent Maxima to collect you from the Rising Stones along with Krile, though I do not see them with you.” Raubahn said, sparing Hades a questioning glance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And call me Emet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Far more appropriate given I now no longer hold a connection to my old Empire.” Hades said with a smirk ghosting over his lips, using his free hand to run through his snow white hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet.” Hades corrected."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “For the love of─okay yes, Emet as in Emet-Selch, one of the three unsundered Ascian’s you told us of and to put it as simply as possible, he is on our side and is one of the good guys now so would you be so kind as to not shoot him?” Aestelle asked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gaius never tore his eyes away from Hades even as he reluctantly released his hold on the hilt of his gunblade."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades placed his free hand to his chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades.” Aestelle said warningly under her breath, glancing up at him and then looking to Gaius."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If my memory serves, the White Raven has long since been gone since the battle at Cateneau.” Hades pointed out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Well Aestelle could have told you that much.” Hades scoffed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her hold on Hades’ hand tightened the moment she noticed he was about to say something about her being used yet again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Don’t worry, fate has had a field day in making a mockery out of me as well so consider us one and the same despite our histories.” Aestelle reassured, already pulling Hades to turn and head for the doors to the conference room."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She raised a hand to wave just as Hades so regularly does while the guards opened the doors for them both."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And with that, Aestelle and Hades left the Black Wolf and the General in the conference room, neither glancing back to the two who couldn’t tear their gazes away from them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I feel like I could have written more snarky back and forth between Emet and Gaius so I'm going to work on that in the chapters to come when venturing into the Sorrows of Werlyt plot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Maybe even bring up Livia and see what Emet's take on her is if time allows."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gosh the real challenge of this fic isn't even trying to fit Emet into the plot anymore, it's just finding time to explore everything I desperately want to xD Aestelle glanced up at Hades for a moment, dust flying along the sticky warm breeze that blows through the Ghimlyt Dark."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Grabbing her hand, Hades pulled her a little closer as he watched embers dance down from up above, the dark grey clouds never lifting even after all of these months."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’re smiling.” Hades noted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades squeezed her hand lightly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You think about them often, don’t you..?” Hades asked softly, the Alliance Headquarters coming into view in the distance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Stopping, Hades tugged on her hand to prevent her from walking any further."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not now Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades smirked as he placed his free hand to his chest and gave a halfhearted bow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “How do you know this for certain if you’ve never fought these replicas before?” Gaius asked, Hades glancing down at her curiously as well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Estinien told me about it the last time we ran into each other in Ishgard a few nights ago.” She lied, Hades' brows twitching ever so slightly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Just as she was turning to leave, Hades’ hold on her hand tightened."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And to think I once thought highly of your kind.” Gaius scoffed, Hades glaring at him from over his shoulder."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I have to go, Emet.” She said with her smile never faltering."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And you think I can go on if I must watch you die yet again?” Hades countered, following closely after her while the three they left behind watch them with curious expressions."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I do this because I  want to, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Despite her words, she made no move to leave him just yet, Hades wrapping his arms around her waist and back as a heavy sigh escapes his lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I will always be Azem and a member of the Scions...but more importantly, I am yours just as you are mine, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What a weird turn of events─Elidibus, Lahabrea, and Hades all playing a part in the Garlean Empire at one point or another."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It never really crossed her mind before that they’ve each had a hand in shaping the Empire; Hades was the founding father of the Empire, Lahabrea gave them the Heart of Sabik to animate the Ultima Weapon, and Elidibus nearly succeeded in convincing late Emperor Varis to continue this futile war here in Eorzea while she and the Scions were stranded on the First."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She was more than prepared to die for the Convocation before the Great Sundering and she is still ready to trade her life for Hades and her friends if a time comes and her death is the only answer to their plight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They can’t hope to live up to all that Lahabrea had once given them and without Hades or Elidibus there to offer some sort of other Allagan enhancements, this fight was never a fight to begin with."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades is going to be upset with her once this is over."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The last real fight she had taken on was against Hades and clearly that fight took a toll on her just as it did him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades and Gaius and the others are nearby and will come to her soon enough."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No matter how strong she gets, she’ll always be weaker than Hades and Elidibus… How is she to ever fulfill her duty to the Convocation if this is her reality?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You managed to evade every attack but one and this is the result?” Hades sighed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades rolled his eyes at her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" More footsteps rushing to Allie’s side resounded and Aestelle placed her head down onto Hades' chest as he held her up and continued to heal her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aestelle leaned a little more into Hades as fatigue began to set in, the blood loss surely getting to her now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Slipping further and further away from reality, Aestelle mentally sighs to herself as Hades carefully lifts her up into his arms bridal style, handling her as if she were made of literal glass."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I will tend to your wounds more thoroughly once we’ve returned to Ala Mhigo.” Hades murmured, already walking off with her held protectively in his arms, not caring one bit that she is covered in blood and surely staining his clothes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For us, too.” Aestelle heard Allie say, her voice being carried along on the wind the further Hades walks her away from Gaius and his children."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Technical difficulties aside, Emet is precious and Gaius *still* needs more screentime."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I'll probably add a few more chapters here on the Source before either ending this story and starting the second one or just throwing Aestelle and Emet back onto the First and then starting the second book :3 I definitely want to save most of the Elidibus\/ Eden Raid things for the second book so I'll be trying to figure out a good stopping point for this story soon ^^ Can't wait to have Gaia and Ryne cute moments with Urianger and Thancred being dad's in the background while Aestelle and Emet try to keep everything from self-destructing The Sorrow of Werlyt questline is going to be fun to go through as well ngl like just imagine all of the emotional turmoil Aestelle will get to go through as she watches Allie struggle bus her way through the plot with the bonus Gaius\/ Emet banter lul Emet just exists to annoy everyone and I feel like Elidibus isn't going to be any better once he's around :p “Just because you two and Lahabrea and Elidibus and Emet and everyone else have lost faith in me doesn’t mean I can just stop trying… There could be an answer to this hell somewhere out there, I know there must be and I just haven’t found it yet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet and Elidibus wouldn’t stop fussing over what mount would suit me best and you three went behind their backs to create this for me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I’m not sure if Emet ever told you this, but I grew up alone outside of Amaurot and drifted between villages and towns until I one day ended up here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Eventually I met Emet and later Elidibus and suddenly I was friends with all of you as well and I...I can’t just stop trying.” “What about Emet-Selch?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lahabrea would have gone to Emet and Elidibus by now telling them to try and stop me and it’s only a matter of time before my beloved pinpoints my location."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I won’t stay out long this time and sorry in advance for how grouchy Emet is going to be once he finds out I’m gone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’ll be home soon Eli, Laha, and Hades.” She murmured, the three men watching her go as she flies higher and higher into the sky, disappearing from their views entirely when she goes behind the Capitol."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That she fought with Hades and even Elidibus just before she left Amaurot that last time before the Final Days?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Where’s Emet?” She asked, her throat feeling far more scratchy and dry than it ever should."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Then what of Emet-Selch?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus is roaming free and will no doubt set his sights on the First to finish off what Emet failed to accomplish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet and I should make it back here before it’s time to fight Sapphire so try not to do anything else to get yourself injured while I’m away Gaius."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Your talk with Gaius was an interesting one.” Emet said, his voice reaching her before she saw his portal whirl to life beside her bed and he stepped out from the rift to greet her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked at her for a moment before chuckling to himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades remained quiet for a moment as he looked into her eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When she told Ardbert of her actions─that she had killed both Hades and Elidibus─she was talking to a ghost."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ardbert was there when she needed someone to help her...but now he’s gone and Hades is right."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Your silence is damning.” Hades said with a scoff."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “When did we get married?” Hades asked only to laugh the moment she smacked his arm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Placing a hand to his chest, Hades grasped at the fabric of his shirt as if she had truly hurt him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He will be who she saves next and she can only pray that the Twelve will see to it that she doesn’t fail him just as they ensured she wouldn’t fail Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Patch 5.5 is dropping in less than a month now and so I figured this is as good a time as any to end this book and start the next one where Elidibus gets his true time to shine.~ Of course the story is still going to be centered around Aestelle and Hades along with the other Ascians (*cough cough* Mitron and Loghrif *cough*) but this fic has turned into a mini novel at this point and really, why not just turn it into a full on trilogy?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It belongs to no other than Emet-Selch, and Cassia tenses as she sees him stand only a few yalms away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" About the Architect, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch only shrugs as he leans against one of the bookshelves."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She isn’t prepared for how quickly Emet-Selch’s look turns into a frown."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At her honest reply, Emet-Selch only scoffs dismissively."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That’s why the Prima Vista was so well funded then,” she speculates, and when Emet-Selch nods, some things about the high regards for the theatre company that had been present throughout the Empire suddenly make a lot more sense to her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “More?” Emet-Selch crosses his arms in front of him as he gives her a curious look."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ‘The best she has ever performed’,  was that not so?” Emet-Selch’s smile looks less mocking than Cassia would have expected."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And, did they reply?” Emet-Selch askes with a curious look."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Now I’m interested, what did you want to ask?” The curiosity is still in Emet-Selch’s eyes as he leans forward a bit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is obviously not letting himself be discouraged and his voice turns almost mocking as he asks,  “My, was it something embarrassing perchance?” “What was your favorite thing about that play then?” Emet-Selch asks instead, and Cassia is grateful for the simple change of topics."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “My dear, that was the point of the whole play,” Emet-Selch says, and there is a slight hint of condescension in his tone as he continues, “I’ve seen quite a few performances of it, by different theatres, and on that, every director agreed.” She half-expects Emet-Selch to outright laugh at her any moment now, but when she steals a quick look at him, he only seems to be calmly waiting for her to continue."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch does not react like she would have expected though."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If you think about it, the play still has a much more compelling villain,” she suggests, and when Emet-Selch only gives her a questioning look, Cassia smiles."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That’s a very unique perspective…” Emet-Selch finally says after a while, and she can’t pinpoint if he finds her suggestion worth thinking about, or if he is trying to be polite in his dismissal."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch looks nearly taken aback, disbelief clouding his features."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She can see that he doesn’t seem to think much of her little explanation as Emet-Selch draws in a deep breath before he gives her a piercing look."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Were?” she asks, unexpectedly hung up on that one little word, and Emet-Selch lets out a soft laugh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And I had been for nearly five years at that point.” She takes a deep breath before she looks at Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The dismissive look is completely gone from Emet-Selch’s face, replaced by blatant interest, and Cassia swallows."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It is one of my many talents,” Emet-Selch says, indicating a little bow with a hint of flourish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At that, Emet-Selch lets out a genuine laugh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch only shrugs at that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Of course it was, the boy was never one for self-indulgence.” Emet-Selch scoffs with an aside wave of his hand before he pushes himself off the bookshelves."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Indulgence, my dear,” Emet-Selch says with an impatient click of his tongue."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Don’t bother,” Emet-Selch says with a dismissive note."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When she next sees Emet-Selch, he is complaining about their pace and their decision to take a few days of rest before marching onward to the Rak’tika forest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She doesn’t know all too much about Emet-Selch, but she knows what he is, after all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch might not have personally destroyed her home, but even if he didn’t have a direct hand in it, she had no doubt that he had been in complete support of what had happened back then."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She doesn’t need to turn around to know that Emet-Selch is standing not too far behind her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Pardon?” comes Emet-Selch’s reply, a hint of curiosity swinging in his voice as Cassia shakes her head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The look Emet-Selch gives her is the same he had held when asking her about the play, somehow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And what would you have them do?” Emet-Selch argues, the questioning look on his face an obvious challenge to her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Whatever Cassia had expected him to say next, it certainly had not been this, and as Emet-Selch speaks, something in his voice gives her pause."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Dying is the easy part.” Emet-Selch’s voice sounds slightly more raw than before."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To her surprise, it is her quiet, honest question that has Emet-Selch almost recoil for a moment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s lips curl up into a mocking smile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It seems like he won’t, as Emet-Selch gives her one last long look before turning around in silence, slowly walking away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His back still toward her, Emet-Selch’s words hang heavy in the air and Cassia frowns."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch had been nothing but thorough."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch seems like a wholly different person on paper."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When she meets Emet-Selch in the Ocularum the next day, she feels his eyes linger on her for a while, but other than that, he makes no mention of their strange correspondence."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It points out paragraphs and whole scenes where Emet-Selch goes into detail about how they relate to the author’s later plays and shows how the motifs they used evolved to support his earlier arguments."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The number of details Emet-Selch brought up in his observation and analysis of the text is almost overwhelming, and Cassia feels she has to contemplate every word, every sentence she writes perfectly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With Emet-Selch on the other hand, there seems to be nothing  but conflict, strewn all over the pages."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The book sits carefully in her pocket wherever she goes, together with Emet-Selch’s notes so she can go through both them and the book at the same time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She genuinely enjoys reading through Emet-Selch’s notes to a point where she is hoping to keep the conversation going as much as possible."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That’s what I’ve been trying to say, but they have been arguing that the similarities do not matter in the grand scheme of things.” Cassia hurries to add her explanations about how Emet-Selch seems so adamant on the importance of fate and destiny in the work, making reconciliation impossible."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To bring in a layer of subtlety otherwise lost,” she suggests, bringing up some of the same arguments Emet-Selch had jotted down."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She can already imagine that accusing Emet-Selch of having his interpretation clouded by emotions of all things would get her a fierce reply, and she almost lets out a little laugh at the mere thought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A small chuckle escapes her, as she realizes that Emet-Selch’s notes about that particular chapter seem to constantly be brimming with snark."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the faint shadows thrown into her room by pale moonlight she makes out Emet-Selchs form and her first reaction is a sliver of fear about having him hover so close to her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “This!” Emet-Selch nearly shoves the papers in her face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “ Your outright dismissal of certain themes suggests a view colored by cynicism’,” Emet-Selch quotes one of her paragraphs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You are implying that the author put in all these little references you seem to cling to, but they are all circumstantial,” Emet-Selch argues back brashly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch shakes his head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Maybe they didn’t do it deliberately?” Cassia prompts, and Emet-Selch only scoffs at her answer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Your sister?” Emet-Selch sounds both highly skeptical and a little bit curious."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Of course.” Emet-Selch lets out a toneless laugh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If I’m honest, I’m not sure  I  approve either,” she murmurs, and this time, Emet-Selch’s laugh sounds a lot more genuine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I would very much like to continue this discussion, but I am going to need to get up and get some warmer clothes, possibly make some tea, so if you wouldn’t mind?”  She looks pointedly to where he is still sitting on her bed and the brief look of confusion on Emet-Selch’s face is almost amusing before he realizes she needs him to move so she could get out of bed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “How inconvenient,” Emet-Selch murmures and after a moment of deliberation he just shrugs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “So, silly notions about subconscious motives aside, the point you made about the ocean theme being present in both works is intriguing,” Emet-Selch simply starts their discussion back up, as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened in between."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Somehow, Emet-Selch had been there, striding up and down the stage, waving the script around while feeding the actors their lines."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Cassia watches Emet-Selch draw Y’shtola out of the lifestream and return her back to them in full health, she can’t help but be in awe."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And yet, when they had been all but paralyzed by grief, Emet-Selch had simply sighed, as if he was bored by their display of emotions, before he had gone and done the impossible."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Emet-Selch appears in the aftermath of their battle, his eyes linger on her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There is no reason to assume Emet-Selch would hang around the whole day, but something in her is adamant she would find him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I was taking a nap…” comes Emet-Selch’s slightly sour reply."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch gives her a droll look."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It seemed like a place I would be?” Emet-Selch furrows his brow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch gives her a look full of confusion."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And lighter.” She is about to add an apology for bothering him with her strange mood when she sees Emet-Selch’s eyes widen slightly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You had a dream about me?” Emet-Selch’s eyebrows rise up as he looks her up and down."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I did indeed look different once upon a time,” Emet-Selch says slowly, and something in his voice sounds off, but Cassia can’t quite tell what it is."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Trust me, there are no pictures of that, it was long before my time as a Garlean Emperor.” Emet-Selch eyes her carefully “But this is not why you are actually here,” he says with an expectant look."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch lets out a soft snort."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch looks confused for a moment, and Cassia sighes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It takes Emet-Selch a moment of openly confused staring before he catches himself and his usual, slightly dismissive looking expression is back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There is something in Emet-Selch’s eyes that Cassia can’t place as he slowly gets up and takes a step closer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You try and unlearn a few lifetimes of habits over the course of a couple of conversations,” Emet-Selch says, his raised eyebrows matching the hint of mockery in his tone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s voice rips Cassia out of her sudden burst of melancholy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Throwing her for a loop, Emet-Selch steps closer before unceremoniously sitting down next to her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ah…” Emet-Selch says, his voice sounding much more understanding all of a sudden, and Cassia finds her curiosity piqued."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Next to her, Emet-Selch scoffs lightly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Once,” Emet-Selch says before looking away again, his eyes starting to follow the people dancing below instead."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I had a son once,” Emet-Selch says quietly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thousands of years of knowledge and nearly unlimited magic at my disposal, and my own son dies of a mere children’s disease.” Emet-Selch lets out a bitter laugh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As his voice trails off, sounding terribly empty to Cassia’s ears, Emet-Selch shakes his head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I was under the impression you do not share my view of the state of your world at all,” Emet-Selch says with a curious look on his face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Cassia looks back up, she notices Emet-Selch’s eyes have not left her, looking at her with a strange intensity before he softly shakes his head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I guess not.” There is a strange sense of understanding between them as they keep looking at each other before Emet-Selch suddenly leans closer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As if he had caught himself staring, Emet-Selch suddenly clears his throat before he gets back up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “My dear,” Emet-Selch finally says as he finds his voice again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Adriene and Lay both jump into the conversation, adding some details here and there, but Cassia’s attention is stuck on the very picture of casual disinterest Emet-Selch makes as he leans against the wall not too far from her, watching the whole procedure with half-closed eyes and a bored expression on his face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She almost doesn't notice that Emet-Selch moves, not until he suddenly stands much closer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She doesn't imagine the small snort that comes from Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Tell me,” Emet-Selch adds quietly, his voice barely audible, “were you aware that the novel that your enticing little show was referencing was written by the same author as the two plays we discussed?” She can practically feel the light chuckle from Emet-Selch next to her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a loud thud, Cassia snaps the book shut in shock as she feels heat rising in her at the realization of just what kind of novel Emet-Selch had left for her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They are tastefully done, but Cassia can’t keep her mind from drifting back to her conversation with Emet-Selch earlier that day."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is standing not far from her, leaning against the wall with his usual casual aura of disinterest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s smile widens as he asks, “So, what was your favorite part then?” “Is it offending your sensibilities, my dear?” Emet-Selch asks, managing to sound only mildly patronizing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Perhaps I am just hoping for you to enjoy yourself while reading,” Emet-Selch replies smoothly, and the way his eyes wander over her scantily clad form gives her goosebumps."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch takes the book with a gleam in his eyes that makes her shudder."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch finds what he is looking for a moment later, and with the hint of a smile on his face, he starts to read."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s voice that is usually so scathing and harsh sounds a good bit warmer and more inviting as he reads."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Cassia can see Emet-Selch’s eyes leave the book for a moment to run over her appreciatively before he goes back to reading."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You, my dear, are very impatient,” comes Emet-Selch’s voice all of a sudden, and then something clasps around her wrist."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What is this?” she asks curiously, but Emet-Selch does not seem keen to answer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ah, don’t interrupt, my dear, this is one of the best parts,” Emet-Selch chides, and the look he gives her across the rim of his glasses sends a heated tingle of lust through her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She can see Emet-Selch glance at her ever so often, an appreciative look on his face, yet he does not stop reading."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch reads about teasing touches, and Cassia feels several hands on her breasts, cupping and kneading her flesh as fingers seem to play with her piercings, tugging playfully in between pinches that have her moaning deeply."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The words Emet-Selch reads ring in her ears, and Cassia knows she could get lost in the sensation of his voice alone, yet every brush of aether against her skin pushes her even further."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She hears Emet-Selch read about the courtesan getting on her knees for her many admirers, and her body moves as if it’s on strings, guided and held by the magic around her until she, too, is on her knees, facing him with wide eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aether presses against her lips, cool, blunt, and wide, and  Emet-Selch licks his lips as she shivers under his gaze before he smiles."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch raises his brows as he puts the book down and looks at her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I don’t think you want me to stop at all,” Emet-Selch murmurs, and his lips curl, widening his smile as his aether pushes into her further."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “No,” Emet-Selch agrees."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch looks utterly composed, but Cassia can feel from the tension and the insistence of his aether that he is far more impacted by all of this than he gives away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You could do so much more than watch, you know?” she adds invitingly, and Emet-Selch licks his lips again as his eyes spark with amusement."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It is both ridiculous and strangely exciting, she thinks, to realize that despite everything his magic is doing to her, Emet-Selch still sits out of her reach and fully clothed as he watches her over the rim of his glasses."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I believe you promised me somewhat of a show,” Emet-Selch murmurs, and a moment later, the part pushing into her picks up pace."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch doesn’t let up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s aether retreats as he closes the book and stands to put it on her bedside table."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There are not many things that make her blush, but the memory of the way Emet-Selch’s eyes had bored into her while he had fucked her without even laying a hand on her certainly did."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Did it have something to do with Emet-Selch?” she asks all of a sudden, and Cassia has to fumble so as not to let go of the bag of tea-leaves."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s voice holds a hint of smugness as he appears in her room."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When it takes her a moment, Emet-Selch’s eyebrows rise up, and he gives her a curious look."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Tension fills the room, and Cassia is still thinking of a way to dissipate it when Emet-Selch takes a step closer, and there is a look of genuine curiosity on his face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Excuse me?” Adriene hisses just as Cassia lets out an offended “Hey!” on her sister’s behalf, but neither one of their sharp tones seem to have any impact on Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Stop staring at me!” Adriene demands, and Cassia can tell that Emet-Selch’s scrutiny has thrown her sister off by the way she tenses her jaw."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Not that it matters,” Emet-Selch murmurs, and he shakes his head before his eyes are on Cassia again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Just a little something to add to your reading list,” Emet-Selch says smoothly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Wait,” she murmurs before narrowing her eyes at Emet-Selch once more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch, meanwhile, seems to be almost amused by the sudden uproar."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch, though, isn’t just anyone, and while his eyes flash dangerously for a moment as he clenches and unclenches his jaw with a slight wince, he is quick to find a semblance of calm again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I don’t care, keep your distance, or else…” she threatens again, and it sparks something in Emet-Selch’s eyes that doesn’t bode well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s lips are warm and inviting, and he uses the fact that she was about to talk to let his tongue slip into her mouth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After a moment, Emet-Selch’s eyes fly open, and he draws back ever so slightly, staring at her with a shocked expression."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s kiss is devouring."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A harmony accompanies it that makes her heart flutter painfully as her hands clasp into the fur of Emet-Selch’s coat, and she tries her best to hold on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Whatever Emet-Selch is doing is not painful at all, yet the intensity behind it scares her to no end."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You,” Emet-Selch says, and it is only one word, but it is filled to the brim with emotions as his gloved fingers trail down her cheek, gifting a most gentle caress onto her skin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Cassia stiffens as she tries to push herself away from Emet-Selch, but it only causes the arm around her waist to tighten."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s eyes narrow as he takes in Adriene’s shouted threats before he looks back at Cassia."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Where she had just tried to push Emet-Selch away, she now grabs his coat almost in a panic, holding on with all her might as she tries not to go mad from the sensation of flying and falling at the same time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch, the only part of this whole madness that somehow still makes sense, feels real when everything else around her seems to follow no logic or reason anymore."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When she turns to look up at Emet-Selch, helplessly confused, she finds him looking at her with something akin to expectation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Or like the sudden burst of pain that had shot through her heart when Emet-Selch had kissed her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I am not doing anything, my dear,” comes Emet-Selch’s voice from right behind her as he crouches down."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch draws her closer at some point, shifts them until she is firmly in his lap as he holds her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s touch is somehow grounding, like a life-raft keeping her afloat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s arms tense around her at her words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Cassia whimpers and Emet-Selch’s hungry mouth swallows the noise as he continues to pull her deeper into something unknown, incomprehensible, and her hands that had been clenched into the fabric of his coat are now flat against his chest as she tries to push him away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “No, not now.” Emet-Selch shakes his head, his eyes never leaving hers as if he is constantly searching for something on her face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’ve been here before,” Emet-Selch insists."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Cassia is insistent, but Emet-Selch is not about to let himself be deterred."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I deemed it impossible once,” Emet-Selch murmurs, and he holds her close enough that she can feel his warm breath on her skin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No matter how significant her worries and how potent her dread of the impossible things he told her were, from the moment Emet-Selch touched her, she could feel them drift away almost forcefully as his kiss and his touch demanded her full attention."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A low growl leaves Emet-Selch’s mouth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch actually pauses for a moment in confusion."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch looks more like a stranger to her than he had on the day they first met as he simply disentangles them and stands."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is nowhere in sight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Not that I am not mad you didn’t tell me it was Emet-Selch of all people who wrote you these letters, I absolutely am, but you look like you’ve been to several hells and back.” Carefully, Adriene wipes a few stray tears from Cassia’s face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" According to Emet-Selch, not much."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Relief because she is far too busy to sit around in her room and think about Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And then she remembers Emet-Selch’s words towards her sister."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In it lie the other two books Emet-Selch had given her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hastily, she reaches for her notebook, where she has stored all the letters from Emet-Selch, and pulls out the first one she can get her hands on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her heart is beating furiously as Cassia realizes that the words Emet-Selch had read to her while his aether had touched her whole body had not been a random story; they had been his own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If Emet-Selch had relished the chance to argue for his motivations in a setting where he would not be outright dismissed because of their differing goals and ideologies."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Fancy finding you here,” comes Emet-Selch’s voice from behind her, and she can hear a hint of surprise in it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her voice is quiet, and Emet-Selch is completely still, giving her a questioning look."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She can feel Emet-Selch taking a step closer before he clears his throat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Something you don’t always complain about,” Emet-Selch points out, and Cassia isn’t certain if the shiver that runs down her back is due to unease or something else."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch seems oddly still as if he is trying his best not to let a single emotion show."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch shakes his head ever so slightly, but Cassia only holds on stronger."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There is a pained expression on his face as Emet-Selchs hands cover hers, making to pry them off, but Cassia is nothing if not determined as she pulls herself even closer until her lips nearly drag over his."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “My dear,” Emet-Selch says in a rough voice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Pain flashes in his eyes as Emet-Selch swallows heavily."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Against her, Emet-Selch has become completely still, staring at her with a pained yet somehow hopeful expression."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’m afraid, between the two of us, I have never been able to claim to be the stronger one,” Emet-Selch mutters quietly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A moment later, his lips brush over hers in a soft touch, and Cassia swears she can taste the aether hovering between them on her tongue as Emet-Selch whispers against her lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After this day, it doesn’t come as a surprise that Emet-Selch is right there when she closes the door behind her, waiting for her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Cassia reaches for him, and when she does, his arms are around her, taking over and holding her firmly against him, and when she rises up on her toes, Emet-Selch meets her halfway in a searing kiss."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Emet-Selch draws back ever so slightly to let her gasp for air Cassia finds his eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch,” she whispers urgently."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch gives her a curious look."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I did,” Emet-Selch replies slowly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s eyebrows rise as he gives her a curt nod."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Can you help her?” she asks softly, and for a moment, Emet-Selch is very still before he starts to frown."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s eyes widen for a moment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s eyes wander over her like he is sizing her up, and she fights the urge to fidget with her dress under his scrutiny as his eyebrows rise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At that, Emet-Selch lets out a laugh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch gives her a long look before he finally inclines his head with a nod."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I cannot promise you anything,” Emet-Selch adds with an almost apologetic look on his face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I shall have a look and assess the situation,” Emet-Selch agrees."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Come morning then,” Emet-Selch agrees, and his arm around her tightens ever so slightly, pressing her subtly against him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It feels almost wrong to even think of anything but her worries about her sister, but at the same time, the prospect of being distracted by whatever Emet-Selch is offering is nothing but tempting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Are you quite certain of that, my dear?” Emet-Selch asks, tugging at the button once more before he undoes it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If you think I am not a woman of my word…” Cassia starts, but Emet-Selch only shoots her an amused look."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A shimmer of satisfaction lies in Emet-Selch’s eyes as he leans closer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch lets out a noise that makes her knees weak as she lets her tongue slip into his mouth and his grip on her tightens."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Especially not when, with another snap, Emet-Selch’s gloves disappear, and his hands are back on her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Whenever Emet-Selch touches her, truly touches her without anything left between them, his bare hands on her skin feel like they burn part of him into her entire being."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch chuckles softly at her attempts to undress him as Cassia lets out a huff of frustration."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You are being impatient again,” Emet-Selch chides her softly, running his hands down her back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is that what you are going for?” she asks, and she is unprepared for the look of pure delight on Emet-Selch’s face as he closes his eyes for a moment and savors her words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You assume a lot,” Emet-Selch answers, sounding almost a bit defensive, and Cassia shakes her head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She gives him a pointed look, and for a moment, Emet-Selch seems hesitant before he closes his eyes and shakes his head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “From what I know of your illustrious past, I would assume you are quite adept at that,” Emet-Selch murmurs, and Cassia lets out a laugh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I am very aware of that, my dear,” Emet-Selch murmurs as he undoes the last button."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She blinks for a second, and then, finally, she can let her hands run over his bare skin as Emet-Selch drags her closer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I would have thought that with your life experience, you’d be a much more patient man,” Cassia murmurs as her hands roam over his chest, feeling a soft rumble under the touch as Emet-Selch lets out a laugh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s fingers run along her temple before burying into her hair, and Cassia seals her lips tightly around him before she starts to move."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The way his eyes widen ever so slightly and the noise that escapes Emet-Selch cause a heated desire to pool between Cassia’s legs as she slowly pulls back only to do it again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She can feel a shudder going through Emet-Selch as she looks up at him with wide eyes before she swallows around him, savoring the way he tenses and the sound of his soft moan that reaches her ears."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A moment later, Emet-Selch pulls her up, and his lips find hers, kissing her furiously as he moves them towards her bed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s hand moves from her hips in between her legs, pushing them apart."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “My dear, it seems I am certainly not the only one who is impatient,” Emet-Selch murmurs in delight, and the way he looks at her with a satisfied curl of his lips sends a shiver down her back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Luckily, no one is paying you at all right now,” Emet-Selch says with a laugh, moving back the slightest bit to evade her attempt to close the distance between them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His cock is trapped between them, pressing hard against her stomach, and she smiles at him when she sees her movement sending a bout of pleasure through Emet-Selch as well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh, you have no idea just how much I want this,” Emet-Selch mutters before he does it again, and Cassia bucks her hips once more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch isn’t moving inside her, though; all his intention seems to be focused on kissing her senseless."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Make me,” she both demands and dares, and Emet-Selch’s eyes spark deviously."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It could have been frightening if it weren’t for the sense of completion Cassia feels when Emet-Selch’s mind is right there, inviting and welcoming her with his whole being."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is right there with her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gently, Emet-Selch draws a strand of hair out of her face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch sounds almost playful at that, and Cassia slowly opens her eyes to look up at him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I apologize,” Emet-Selch says simply as his arms tighten around her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I…” Emet-Selch starts, but the words seem to have deserted him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s eyes fall close for a moment as if he’s savoring her gentle touch before he draws in a deep breath."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “No, I don’t.” Emet-Selch’s simple words are accompanied by a toneless laugh as his hand tilts her head even further as if he needs to be able to see every ilm of her face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch lets out a soft sigh before he pulls her even closer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The question spills from her lips before she can even think about it, and it makes Emet-Selch go still for a moment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’ve said that Emet-Selch was more akin to a title,” Cassia points out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch lets out a sigh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There is a pained look in Emet-Selch’s eyes as he admits, “It has driven some of them insane.” “I’ve been watching your exploits here in the First with my full attention,” Emet-Selch points out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch lets out a toneless laugh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Take it as a comfort,” Emet-Selch suggests as his lips hover directly over hers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Cassia first awakens, she finds herself wrapped up in Emet-Selch’s arms, and for a few, blissful moments she closes her eyes and basks in the feeling that waking up like this stirs within her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She can feel Emet-Selch breathing, his chest moving gently with every breath against her back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When they had first met in the Crystarium, Emet-Selch had appeared to them as an illusion only."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And the fact that Emet-Selch tended to hide away in far to reach or carefully concealed places whenever he fell asleep may have felt whimsical to her at first, but by now, she has realized that it is a matter of being careful for him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even in his sleep, Emet-Selch holds her tightly against him, and Cassia is struck by the feeling of how much she yearns for this moment to never end."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s arms around her tighten slightly, his breath warm on her skin as he replies in a far less cheerful voice, “The sun is not even up!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You are a menace,” Emet-Selch murmurs, but already he sounds much more awake."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s voice is low against her ear, and a moment later he presses soft kisses against her neck."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She is still lost with simply feeling when Emet-Selch speeds up a bit, and she feels his release inside her accompanied by a moan and soft kisses along her back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s lips do not stay on hers for long before, with another smile, he moves down."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She almost instinctively throws her head back, but the way Emet-Selch is still looking at her with burning eyes from between her legs makes her unable to even close her eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A moment later, Emet-Selch is back right next to her, kissing her harder than before, and the faint taste of both herself and him on his tongue sends another shiver through Cassia."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch has the foresight to not be around in her room when she opens the door."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She is standing at the sides, looking from a distance at the proceedings at the ladder, when she feels Emet-Selch coming up behind her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch lets out a scoff."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She knows this has been a long shot, but still, when Emet-Selch slowly shakes his head, her heart sinks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “My dear, I am as baffled by this as you are,” Emet-Selch assures her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch had hinted about the effects the Light had on her before."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “The Light is dangerous all on its own, my dear,” Emet-Selch says with a solemn look."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “The people of this world call you ‘Warriors of Darkness,’ don’t they?” Emet-Selch muses as he looks from them back to Cassia."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There is a hint of regret on Emet-Selch’s face as he looks at her for a moment before he shakes his head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A toneless laugh comes from Emet-Selch before he shakes his head again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There is a hint of surprise in Emet-Selch’s eyes at her words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Even with all the power I wield, there are things that stay my hand,” Emet-Selch says with a strange note in his voice as he inclines his head at her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She can see the desire flare up in Emet-Selch’s eyes at her words before he closes them with a deep sigh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh, you misunderstand me,” Emet-Selch says with a small shake of his head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch had freely admitted that all the Ascians had been tempered by Zodark at his creation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It is a chilling thought, knowing that for all his seemingly immeasurable power, even someone like Emet-Selch is bound to certain things."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With his eyebrows raised, Emet-Selch gives her a peculiar look."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh, do not give me this betrayed look,” Emet-Selch scoffs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Something in Emet-Selch’s eyes shifts, becomes softer as he takes a step closer to her and draws a loose strand of hair out of her face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch closes his eyes for a moment, a pained look on his face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Once again, Cassia feels torn about every single one of her feelings, and Emet-Selch seems determined to not make it any easier for her as he pulls her close enough to let his lips brush over hers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Emet-Selch pauses for breath, he keeps her close, their foreheads touching as their breath mingles."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Cassia briefly wonders if she should mention the things she has learned from Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Realizing that it had been Emet-Selch who had set this Lightwarden on its path many years ago does not come as a surprise to her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of course, his plan to self-sacrifice himself to keep the Light away means nothing when Emet-Selch takes him out of the equation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Emet-Selch comes to a halt in front of her, crouching down, she sees regret and resignation all over his face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her sister looks angry and ready to pounce, but this time Emet-Selch seems prepared."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The look on Emet-Selch’s face is unreadable as he reaches out to her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It doesn’t matter now, my dear,” Emet-Selch murmurs with a dangerous glint in his eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch says something she can’t comprehend to her friends before he turns them towards the portal, and Cassia clenches her eyes shut and buries her face against his coat before it swallows them whole."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch gently lowers her down onto an immaculately made bed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The look on Emet-Selch’s face is almost indulgent as he smiles at her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Your contingency plan?” she asks carefully, and Emet-Selch nods gravely."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “To bring you to  Him  ,” Emet-Selch finally says, something of the hardness she saw in his eyes before back on his face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her harsh reaction makes Emet-Selch flinch slightly, and for a moment, she is almost happy about it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It will be for your own good,” Emet-Selch insists once more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her words seem to spark something in Emet-Selch as his impatience turns into outright anger."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What?” Emet-Selch frowns and blinks in confusion, seemingly not entirely sure what she is trying to say."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s words sound as desperate as he looks, and Cassia feels fear welling up in her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch, please, I beg you, if this means anything to you, don’t do this,” she whispers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch draws in a deep breath before he lets go of her shoulders, and one of his hands covers hers, holding it as he turns his head and presses a gentle kiss on her wrist."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch still holds her hand in his, lips brushing over her wrist again before he leaves a trail of gentle kisses along the soft skin of the inside of her lower arm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “For now, let me push back the light for as much as I am able to,” Emet-Selch murmurs as he draws her into his arms."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s aether is persistent."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s hands are cool on her skin as he cradles her closer, and then his lips are on hers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She can’t speak with Emet-Selch’s lips sealing hers, but the word races through her mind, expanding, and her eyes fly open wide as she finally remembers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s kiss gets more intense as a word sits right there at the tip of her tongue, and Cassia wonders if he, too, can taste it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades…”  “Hades…” What happens on Emet-Selch’s face the moment she utters his name is nearly indescribable."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Any time Emet-Selch had kissed her, it had been intense, constantly stirring something in her that Cassia had barely been aware of before."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s voice is much lower than she is used to."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You are not,” Emet-Selch agrees, but for once, there is no regret in his voice, no condemnation for her mortality."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The way Emet-Selch looks at her has a firm grasp on her heart, and at this moment, she wants nothing more than to give him everything he wants of her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Give it time, my love,” Emet-Selch murmurs before grazing his hand over her cheek."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch gives her a chiding look that is somehow still filled with fondness as he shakes his head at her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’d rather die to save the world my daughter grows up in than become the very thing bent on its destruction.” She swallows heavily at seeing the flash of hurt in Emet-Selch’s eyes, but the whole thing is too important for her to not put it into words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If I tried to take all that Light from you, it would most likely kill me, my dear,” Emet-Selch confirms her thoughts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “All in good time, my dear,” Emet-Selch murmurs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch…” she starts, only to get interrupted by him immediately."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” she murmurs as she reaches for him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” Cassia whispers the word against his skin, her breath hitching slightly at the shiver that goes through him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a sound that speaks of pure longing, Emet-Selch’s lips press onto hers, and he kisses her again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It is not your fault,” Emet-Selch whispers as he holds her close."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Where Emet-Selch is a man without shadow, his magic now very much looks like one."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s mind is once again wide open to her, drawing her in, welcoming her home, and Cassia wonders if she could gladly spend eternity like this, just existing surrounded by nothing but love."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Before she can do a thing about it, though, Adriene’s eyes snap to Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The question bursts from Cassia’s lips, and behind her, Emet-Selch shifts, darkness gathering around them like a protective shield."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Your sister and you, you share a connection,” Emet-Selch says with narrowed eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The dark aether tightens around her like a comforting embrace as Emet-Selch shakes his head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A moment later, she turns towards Emet-Selch, but instead of her usual hostility towards him, there is only a confused frown on her face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch tenses as Adriene takes a step closer, and instinctively, Cassia shakes his grasp off as she positions herself in between them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades, you’ve made it out of your office,” Hythlodaeus shouts enthusiastically, and with a startled flinch, the formerly peacefully reading man snaps his book shut."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Aegletes, this is Hades; we work together,” Hythlodaeus introduces her with a hint of mirth in their voice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Cassia remembers seeing Hades smile for the first time as they exchange tentative first words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He is a friend of a friend at first, a good while before he takes on the title of Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Strange and oh-so-familiar, it spins a tale of love and friendship between all three of them that makes Cassia wonder what feels worse - the fact that she and Adriene could have forgotten all this or the realization that Emet-Selch never had."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She can see and feel it clearly when Emet-Selch moves and takes a step towards Adriene."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Chose…” A toneless, brittle laugh falls from Emet-Selch’s lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I should have known,” Emet-Selch murmurs, more to himself than to them before he looks at Cassia."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She seems to have no answer, but Emet-Selch does."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Can you bring Adriene back?” she asks Emet-Selch once more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch looks at his hands."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’m sorry that this is how we meet again,” she says, and next to Cassia, Emet-Selch takes a deep breath."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch knows it too."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I promised I’d save you, didn’t I?” Emet-Selch says, his smile unable to cover the regret in his voice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” she whispers in a quiet plea, and in an instant, his arms are around her, his fingers entangling themselves with her hair as he holds her close and his forehead gently rests against hers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You know, you said you might not live up to my expectations, but somehow, I saw this coming,” Emet-Selch murmurs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch cups her cheek, his thumb grazing gently over her skin as he leans back, but only enough so he can look into her eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I  did  write it for you,” Emet-Selch says simply."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” Cassia gasps as he suddenly clasps her face in both his hands, hovering so close that their lips almost touch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch seems determined to give them one."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s, no, Hades’ words stay her hand, keep her from bursting out how ridiculous all of this is."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even like this, impossibly tall and brimming with aether, Hades doesn’t frighten her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ‘A performance for the ages,’  she hears Emet-Selch’s voice in her head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Cassia wonders if, by now, Emet-Selch agrees with her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She can tell that whatever spell Emet-Selch had used earlier to suppress it is fading fast."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In front of her, Hades roars, and Cassia has the distinct feeling it is more because of what is happening to her than it is about the fight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When she opens her eyes, she knows it's all still there, death and destruction whirling around, but the arms around her belong to Emet-Selch, and he holds her gently, in the eye of the storm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Don’t be,” comes Emet-Selch’s soothing voice from right next to her ear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Neither Emet-Selch nor his magic had ever been rough with her, but even the most delicate touch of his magic pales to how warm and gentle his aether feels now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But now that Emet-Selch does what he does, something clicks into place."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It is not a question, but Emet-Selch gives her the smallest of nods nonetheless."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades…” The whisper of his name is nearly a sob, and a second later, he soothes her burning soul with a kiss so sweet Cassia knows it’s their last."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s voice is but a whisper in the wind as he smiles at her one last time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is gone, and when Cassia returns to her room at night, she realizes that, of course, Ardbert is gone now too."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Something Emet-Selch must have left for her before she had gone to Eulmore."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She had thought that seeing someone being tempered like Emet-Selch had already been a nightmare, but Elidibus doesn’t even seem to be his own person anymore."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Now though, after what Emet-Selch had done in his final moments, she seems a little more at ease using aether for the first time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But too many things only raise more questions, and Cassia feels herself tethering on the brink of despair once more, wondering if she had made a terribly wrong choice the first time she refused Emet-Selch’s offer to help her remember."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The book is decades old, and Cassia wonders just how long Emet-Selch had planned things ahead."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The shade tells them about soul crystals, inscribed memories, and more, driving home once again just how much Emet-Selch had hoped to find her, to see her again one day."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Listen,” she starts slowly, “I know I said some harsh things to you when I found out it was Emet-Selch you’ve been talking to."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She remembers one of the poems in the final book Emet-Selch had left for her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ‘I’m sorry, Hades,’  she whispers quietly to herself as she closes her eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She wants to reach out, to run to him and hold him tight, but they are still in battle, and as she shields her sister, who is already poised to jump into the fray once more, she can do nothing but watch as Emet-Selch takes a long look at her before the air around him starts to simmer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For the brief seconds when she had felt Emet-Selch’s aether brush against her, her heart had beaten furiously with a spark of hope."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is right there in front of her, looking exactly as she remembers him best."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s hand cups her face, and she is only dimly aware that he isn’t wearing gloves before his skin touches hers, and suddenly it’s all she can think about."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And yet here I am, answering your call,” Emet-Selch points out with a chuckle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A performance like that deserves an encore,” she whispers, and Emet-Selch’s eyes are locked onto hers as he draws her flush against him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Then how about instead of an encore, we aim for something a little higher?” Emet-Selch suggests."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s tongue slips past her lips as Cassia lets out a soft whimper, her whole body shaking with the realization that this is as real as it can be, that he is actually here with her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’re not leaving,” she murmurs in a shaky voice, watching as Emet-Selch slowly shakes his head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You underestimate me, love,” Emet-Selch says, amusement swinging in his voice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Somehow, knowing Emet-Selch as well as she does by now, Cassia highly doubts that, but for the most part, she doesn’t care."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Adequate?” Emet-Selch asks with an indignant tone, clearly displeased that she would expect anything but excellence from him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I see,” Emet-Selch murmurs, with a spark in his eye."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s arms close tightly around her, and she is about to let herself get lost in his embrace when a voice brings her back to reality."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Next to her, Emet-Selch is grinning widely."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Despite his teasing words, Emet-Selch’s eyes are warm and soothing as he uncrosses his arms again and reaches for her hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If you noticed that I turned this into a series it's because I have a little one-shot that plays a little after this story almost done and I am constantly haunted by the idea of a slightly longer (a few chapters) sequel because the idea of Emet-Selch being himself while trying to coexist with the Scions won't leave my brain alone.It might be a while, but it's firmly planned."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You could help her, you say firmly but quietly, and Emet-Selch's eyebrows rise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch lets out a dry laugh at your stab in the dark."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In front of you, Emet-Selch's sharp eyes don't miss a single part of your distress, and his smile widens considerably."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Boredom, the opportunity to mess with you, or simply because I can, Emet-Selch lists with a shrug."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" you ask tentatively, and Emet-Selch's smile takes on a devious touch as he suddenly disappears, only to materialize right behind you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Let me have my way with you for the night, hero, Emet-Selch says in affirmation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You are not sure if you should ask for clarification when Emet-Selch steps around."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You sound a lot more steady than you anticipated, and in front of you, Emet-Selch smiles."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Something in the way Emet-Selch still holds your hand in a tight grip gives you pause."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch leans a little closer, right into your personal space, and you try your best to not flinch away from him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They worship the very ground you walk on, Warrior of Light, Emet-Selch muses with a menacing look that turns into something thoroughly unsettling when he adds a smile to it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At your inability to deny his claim, Emet-Selch looks strangely satisfied."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It does so in the most potent way, as Emet-Selch leans even closer, his hot breath brushing over your flushed skin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You don't dare to move as you keep looking at Emet-Selch, waiting for what he plans to do next with a shiver of anticipation running down your back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This has got to go, Emet-Selch muses before he grabs your panties and starts to twist them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch watches your face closely as he twists further and ups the pressure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not bad for a start, hero, Emet-Selch says with a crooked smile, and suddenly he grabs the hem of your panties once more, and this time he rips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" On your knees then, oh mighty Warrior of Light, Emet-Selch demands as he lets go of you, and it takes you a short moment to comply, but then you sink down to the floor with heated cheeks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch sees you flinch, and the look he gives you is scathing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Don't you worry, my dear hero, Emet-Selch says, sounding somehow both soothing and mildly patronizing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Look at me, and thank me for taking the time to give you this, Emet-Selch demands with a sneer, and you blink through the pain you scramble for words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There is a sense of glee in Emet-Selch's voice as he gives it a harsh tug until you have no choice but to look him right in the eyes again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ah, I did not say you can touch, comes Emet-Selch's voice, and it has an edge to it that sens a shiver through you as you immediately let go."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch smiles as he watches the determined look on your face, and without ever taking his eyes off you, he rubs the tip of his shoe against your folds, and you nearly crumble."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Look at me, hero, Emet-Selch demands, and your head snaps back to stare at him with wide, pleading eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You strain under his touch, your eyes wide with both lust and a hint of fear as Emet-Selch licks his lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There are hands around you, and to your complete surprise, Emet-Selch crouches in front of you, looking you over before he simply picks you up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch had kept his word to the letter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You flinch slightly as you find Emet-Selch looking right back at you with a disapproving frown on his face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch shakes his head with a click of his tongue."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's smile widens, but his eyes harden at the same time as he gives you an eerie look, and suddenly his hand is in your hair, grabbing a handful and pulling harshly until you are forced to tilt your head back as he crushes you against his chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Try that again, my dear, Emet-Selch mocks you as he takes a step closer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh, one more thing, hero, Emet-Selch murmurs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But even though Emet-Selch had taken a price for his help from you, he had also offered you something in return, something you didn't even know you wanted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It is too new, too unexplored, but the possibilities Emet-Selch offers seem so endlessly tempting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As you try to scramble back, Emet-Selch moves much faster than you would have anticipated."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The moment Emet-Selch touches you, everything goes back to normal, almost violently enough to make you dizzy for a moment, and then you find yourself roughly shoved against the door you tried so very hard to reach."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Better luck next time, I guess, Emet-Selch murmurs, his hot breath ghosting over your skin, but the self-satisfied look in his eyes only spurs you on, and with a growl, your hands dig into his arm, trying to dislodge him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At your look of confusion, Emet-Selch gives you a condescending laugh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Open up, hero, Emet-Selch demands, dragging the tip of his cock over your lips, leaving a few drops of moisture behind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch doesn't seem to care that you are struggling, and you can't help the shudder of pure arousal that runs through you at the fact."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch doesn't look up to you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your whole body hums with energy and pent-up tension, and suddenly, Emet-Selch drags you to your feet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch doesn't move his hand or fingers at all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Well, so much for you not being desperate, Emet-Selch murmurs with a look both heated and scathing at the same time as he lowers you back to the ground."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I guess I'll see you soon, Emet-Selch says with a knowing look and a casual wave of his hand, and then he is gone, leaving you behind on the floor of your room with no trace that he was ever there in the first place."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Emet-Selch appears out of one of his dark portals, you are hunched over the sink, mindlessly scrubbing away the blood left under your nails that a simple shower hadn't been able to wash away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's voice is laced with amusement as he lets his fingers trail up the back of your neck and into your lose hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Don't get any ideas about what this is, Emet-Selch says in a dangerously low voice, taking your chin in one gloved hand and making you face him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When he sees how obviously he has flustered you, Emet-Selch's smile widens."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Just something to keep in mind then, hero, Emet-Selch adds like an afterthought as he lets his eyes wander over your naked body."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Noticing your look, Emet-Selch looks almost gleeful, and then he moves faster than you can anticipate, and a second later, he slaps you hard enough your head snaps to the side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You are going to hurt me, you murmur a bit dumbfounded, and at your surprised tone, Emet-Selch lets out a dark chuckle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Where everyone else goes out of their way to anticipate your needs in the kindest way possible, Emet-Selch doesn't seem to care about them at all, yet you undeniably need what he offers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch has gone completely still against you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You catch yourself thinking that it would hardly be a deterrent, but Emet-Selch seems to be aware of that just as well, as he lets out a dry laugh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Good girl, Emet-Selch murmurs into your ear, once more digging his nails into your stinging flesh until you wince in pain before he lets go."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your eyes widen in shock, and when Emet-Selch asks you again if you are going to be good and obedient for him, you nod hastily."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A few harsh slaps later, Emet-Selch proves to you that you can."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Perfection, Emet-Selch murmurs as he watches you with hungry eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But when Emet-Selch starts to move, something akin to panic rushes through you, and for a few seconds, you are not even sure what you fear more - that he might continue or that he will not, and you find yourself scrambling."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Whenever you think about Emet-Selch and what little you know about the path he is on, your heart aches."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of course, Emet-Selch knows exactly why you're doing this and what you are truly asking for."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The sudden dryness in your throat makes it hard to speak, but Emet-Selch doesn't seem to mind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Everywhere Emet-Selch touches, a blissfully cool sensation spreads, like a balm seeping onto your burning skin, slowly dripping deeper and spreading through your strained body."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch asks with an infuriatingly calm look before he leans over you and cups your cheek in a gentle hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You shout the words while twisting under his touch, but Emet-Selch only looks at you with raised brows, a clear expression of mockery on his face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch taunts, and something in you goes cold at the realization that he knows."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Will you look at that, Emet-Selch says with a satisfied growl, and when he moves his fingers in and out, you can hear how wet you are for him regardless."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch doesn't need much to get your body to sing beneath his hands."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch, please, you murmur, gasping in need as you spur him on, only for his hand to shift once more, this time in a way that makes you yelp as his touch on your clit becomes so painfully direct it makes you want to flinch away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Especially when Emet-Selch's fingers glide lazily through your folds again before he spreads them apart, and then he suddenly surges forward to lick a broad stripe over your exposed clit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You can feel the signs of your own arousal dripping out of you from how worked up he has you, but Emet-Selch makes no move to let you go any further than this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Emet-Selch's smile widens, and he starts to move away, you are close to tears."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That is until Emet-Selch clicks his tongue in obvious displeasure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You've been miserable all night, and yet I've not heard you say that one specific word that would stop all this, Emet-Selch muses as he watches your every move with hunger in his eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch, meanwhile, regards you with a frown."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch seems to consider the topic closed for now, and a moment later, he lets go of you and sharply taps the side of your leg."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Try again then, hero, Emet-Selch prompts you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's hands are back on your hips, wandering down, squeezing your ass, and you let out another whimper of need."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh, I can see clearly what you need, my dear, Emet-Selch interrupts you as he lets two fingers slip inside you again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I think your cunt has had enough attention, Emet-Selch murmurs as he drags his soaking wet fingers higher until they circle the tightly puckered hole of your ass."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You flinch, but it is not from pain but rather from the thoroughly new sensations running through your body when Emet-Selch spreads his fingers inside you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Tantalizing enough to get the blood pumping but nowhere near enough to promise any release, Emet-Selch murmurs as he spreads three fingers in your ass."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If you ask for more, I will gladly provide, Emet-Selch says with a hint of promise, and a moment later, the thick head of his cock presses relentlessly against the tight muscle of your ass."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Somehow, each time he has his way with you, Emet-Selch manages to bring deeply buried needs to the surface you weren't even aware you had."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You can't help but think that there is something deeply wrong with you when even the worst things Emet-Selch calls you stirs a part of you that isn't repulsed at all, that yearns for more of the same instead."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's hand tightens, and reflexively yours fly up to grab his arm in a futile attempt to dislodge him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Tell me again what you want from me, dear, Emet-Selch demands as he thrusts into you hard enough you can't keep yourself from making noise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's hold on you becomes impossibly tight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's voice is as unyielding as his touch as you whimper, pleading with your whole body as you twist in his grasp."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Show us both just how easy you are, my dear,\" Emet-Selch murmurs lowly before he lets his teeth scrape over the sensitive skin at your nape."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even when his thrusts get faster, more intense over time, Emet-Selch seems to be in no hurry, perfectly content to draw this out as long as possible."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As you start to greedily suck your own taste off his fingers, Emet-Selch lets out a throaty moan."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch asks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How fortunate, my dear hero, that you only want what I have in abundance to give, Emet-Selch murmurs, and as he speaks, you can feel the familiar touch of his magic slithering across your skin once more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You  know  Emet-Selch had left marks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Survive the next Warden, and maybe I'll let you know more...  Emet-Selch's words are clearly on your mind as you wonder if he had meant it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch isn't let down by the fact that you are breaking apart in front of him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The more time you spend there, the more it becomes painfully obvious why Emet-Selch does what he does and why he can not be reasoned with."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You can't stop fighting, but still, you crumble before Hades' unrelenting onslaught."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's voice sounds perfectly amicable, but the mere fact that you are in some strange place and he is here with you sends a tremor of fear through your entire body."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch takes a step towards you, and you are almost relieved at the sight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch gives you a pitiful look before he draws a strand of your hair out of your face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You barely even know me, you finally manage a while, and Emet-Selch lets out a hollow laugh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's eyes are narrowed as he chides you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch pauses for a second to look at you, his whole expression thoughtful before he shrugs with an eerie smile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a smile, Emet-Selch draws back further, giving you room to breathe as he looks down on you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's eyes light up in approval."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch gives you a foreboding look, eyebrows raised in challenge."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's kiss is not what you would have expected."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You had certainly done your best in that regard, but from what you have just realized, Emet-Selch had never tried to end your life."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch murmurs with a dangerous glint in his knowing eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch gives you a long look, and the smile on his face twists into a grin as his free hand runs over your naked body, claws scratching over your shivering skin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And while it is clear that Emet-Selch doesn't want you permanently harmed, you know this is a test all the same."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is between your legs, responsible for all the sounds leaving your mouth and all the shivers running through your body."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You, my dear, are going to come speared on my cock, and not a moment earlier, Emet-Selch chides you, but you can hear the enjoyment in his tone nonetheless."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch shifts slightly, coming to hover over you, but his hand never leaves you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch drinks in your every reaction as he spreads his fingers inside you, slowly testing your limits."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch speaks with a low growl, pushing deeper for a moment before he retreats a bit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your breath goes faster as Emet-Selch pushes his entire hand slowly but steadily against your soaked cunt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your eyes roll back, and you shudder, moaning shamelessly as Emet-Selch twists his hand ever so slightly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" you mumble, and it causes Emet-Selch to let out an almost cruel sounding laugh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Trust me, Emet-Selch adds with a cocky smirk."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch has kept you on edge for so long you have lost track of time a while ago."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Look at you, already so needy for something you claimed you couldn't take a few hours ago, Emet-Selch mocks in his now much deeper, far more gravelly voice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It's a good thing the magic muffles all the embarrassing wailing sounds that would otherwise leave your mouth as Emet-Selch lets his aether move, drawing out and pushing back into you deeply, filling you to the brim with his darkness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Look at that, comes Emet-Selch's now thunderous voice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch has worked you up to this for such a long time that you are still dripping with your own arousal."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch will make you take him anyway."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You are not even entirely sure if this is still humanly possible or if the large amount of Emet-Selch's aether flowing through you has done something to you as well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch keeps himself perfectly still in all his monstrous glory, moving you up and down instead while the strands of his aether keep filling you from both sides."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Was this what Emet-Selch had meant when he promised to ruin you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch looks like a man again, but his aether still flows freely around him, and with an almost benevolent smile he lets it take form."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Emet-Selch slides onto the bed next to you, pinching the hardened tip of your breasts teasingly, you shudder against your bonds once more, but you find yourself unable to pull on them even the slightest bit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch sounds a little indulgent as he leans back to take a good look at you, licking his lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Emet-Selch leans back ever so slightly, his eyes find yours."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's hand cups your cheek gently, making sure he has your full attention as he repeats, \"I've told you before, you  cannot  disappoint me.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch says as he gleefully licks his lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch chuckles slightly as he once again lets his hand wander lower."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's tongue slips past your lips, curling around yours as he deepens the kiss, and with a breathless sigh, you let go, wrapping your tired arms around his neck and dragging him closer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's arm around you tightens, holding you closely against his chest, and in his other hand, something shimmers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You would scream in both surprise and pain if you could, but Emet-Selch's mouth has sealed yours once again, kissing you deeply."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" comes Emet-Selch's slightly resigned voice, pushing slowly through the fog that surrounds you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That's because they are not, Emet-Selch tells you with a look filled with regret."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's brow furrows."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You are the same, memories of your own or not, Emet-Selch vows, and his fingers trail over your face before his lips close over yours."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch lets out a sigh, closing his eyes for a moment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" you ask with a confused frown, and when he draws back, Emet-Selch smiles once more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch draws you closer against him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch rolls onto his back, drawing you on top of him as if you weigh nothing at all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Perhaps, Emet-Selch agrees, \"But so are you, I've seen to that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's hand sneaks up your back, burying itself in your hair before he twists it harshly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Emet-Selch is not about to let you go gently; that much is sure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And then Emet-Selch lets go of your face, and his hand slides down to your thighs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This is where you belong, my dear, Emet-Selch whispers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Don’t you worry, sometimes these things can’t be rushed, Emet-Selch smiles, and it's the last thing you see before darkness claims you again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch gives you an indulging, almost benevolent-looking smile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch lets out a dark chuckle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In those moments, Emet-Selch needs you to suffer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades… Emet-Selch is still that man."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades snorts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’re being very cruel, Emet-Selch,” she tells him, not at all serious as she tiptoes her way across the cold floor and snatches the mug from his hands."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When she doesn’t deign to answer again, so pink at the cheeks that she looks sunburned; Hades clears his throat and releases her wrist."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades—  Solus—  is there from the very beginning until the very end."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watches them collide into each other; Azem falling to her knees to scoop the child into her arms, burying her face in his hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Were you good for your Father while I was away?” she asks, and Hades catches her eyes peeking over the top of the boy’s platinum hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “So many!” the boy chimes and beams over at a grimacing Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hardly,” Hades sniffs and shrugs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Unlike how she scooped their son up, frantic and desperate to have him in her arms, she is slow with Hades, and he with her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades smiles and pulls his head back just slightly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Ascian known as Emet-Selch sighed heavily and ran a hand through his hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch spent the day with [FN], following her through the market and buying her random baubles while they talked, and taking the seat at her side while they watched the actors perform a comedy that had been popular in the Capital a few years ago."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Please, Hades prayed to Zodiark, to the memory of Amaurot, even to Azem herself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yes, Emet-Selch paused, not wanting to relinquish his grip on Azem, not now that he had found her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No, Emet-Selch set his jaw."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch bit his tongue hard in a vain effort to stave off hope."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades kissed her hungrily, knowing he could not reach her yet, but tasting the edges of her all the same."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Internally, Emet-Selch was delighted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch made the lad wait all of twenty minutes, mostly because some sadistic part of him enjoyed watching the child's growing distress."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Emet-Selch entered his bedchamber, a statuesque woman with dark hair was pawing through the items on [FN]'s vanity, adding them to a basket over her arm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Petronia saluted again and returned to her task, though Emet-Selch wished she would leave."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch knew he'd have to do something about them soon, but for now, Azem's current incarnation was his primary concern."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Tucking the tiny buds in his ears, Emet-Selch was momentarily confused by what he heard, but comprehension quickly overtook him and he tore them free."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch appeared above the crumbling shack near the beach, scowling down at it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I… Emet-Selch swallowed and looked away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How many times have we told you, Emet-Selch?\r\n\tThe Issue, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch pushed his hood off, running a hand through his hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of course not, Emet-Selch replied."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The last touch was Emet-Selch's own idea, adding the same climbing jasmine vines that had adorned her father's house - he hoped it would make [FN] feel more at home here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We didn't have the chance, Emet-Selch said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then he vanished into the Rift as Emet-Selch waved him off."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For half-a-heartbeat, Hades hated his unborn child."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch knew he'd had nothing of the sort, so he could only blink with incredulity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Senate was surprisingly less fractious than they usually were, and though he presented the air of being on edge, Emet-Selch was particularly pleased."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch wasn't sure what angered him more, the idea of another man putting hands on his wife for pleasure, or violence."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It is the emblem of my office, the Seat of the Architect, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch.\r\n\tEmet-Selch is my title, and what the other Convocation members call me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It would be appropriate for you to call me Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades made no move to stop her, and smiled softly when she set the mask in her lap."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She took one last, shuddering breath and said, \"All right, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The orange light of the early evening sun slanted in the windows by the time Hades finished speaking, and [FN] was still curled in on herself, weeping into the handkerchief he'd given her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades turned to search the bodies, but [FN] said, \"Here.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades put an arm around her as she drifted to his side, and he pressed his lips to the top of her head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch drifts from conversation to conversation, safe in his anonymity as he listens to the unfiltered opinions of his guests."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The street lamps flickered to life as Hades paced restlessly outside the office of the Bureau of the Architect."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Such energetic nervousness was a rare state for the esteemed Emet-Selch to be in, but this morning his  supposed  friend had left him with a cryptic parting message that had shaken him to the core."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a dull creak, the doors to the building opened at last, and Hades's full attention snapped to the man strolling towards him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The most eminent Emet-Selch!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus's good cheer and too-broad of a grin sent a cold feeling to the pit of Hades's stomach."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stopped before him, arms crossed and eyes glaring through his red mask."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His grin broadened at Hades's aggravated sigh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Pinching the bridge of his nose, Hades briefly considered just walking away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Relax, Hades.\r\n\tHades's already thought out retort quickly stuttered to a stop, leaving his mouth hanging slightly agape in surprise.\r\n\tHow very generous,\" Hades ground out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades blinked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She was very interested in what the dwelling of Emet-Selch of the Convocation might look like, he explained with a knowing smile spreading across his lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades's annoyance at his friend waned at the warmth blooming in his chest and creeping onto his cheeks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus wrapped an arm around his shoulder, and the two started off in the direction of Hades's apartment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Mind still in a daze from his muted excitement, Hades allowed himself to be led along."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Hades heard no answer, he poked his head around the kitchen wall."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades hummed in mild agreement."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades shuddered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If I am appointed,” she started slowly, the apprehension in her voice immediately seizing his attention, “and I am sent off to roam the star...will you wait for me, Hades?”   “Hades, I need you—” Emet-Selch watched Vhel slowly disappear into the crowded streets outside the training complex."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch made an abrupt turn down a narrow, shaded alley between two stores."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It is unlike you, Emet-Selch, to become so invested in a sundered being,” Elidibus noted in his usual monotone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “So to the point, Emissary!” Emet-Selch placed his hand on his chest, feigning indignity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As the sole Unsundered blessed with the Sight, it fell to Emet-Selch to find their shattered brethren for uplifting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “How fares Lahabrea?” Emet-Selch asked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In a rare occurrence, the first step for the next Rejoining required Lahabrea and Emet-Selch working together."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lahabrea was to spur on the tribes that threatened the southern Garlean border, with Emet-Selch swooping in to play the great war hero in the ensuing conflict."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch gave a limp wave."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch rounded the corner of the alley’s outlet and proceeded onto the bright main street, alone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch wondered how much of his own taste he could get away with introducing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch made sure to always put on his best performance around her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Like all other highborn houses, it was lavish, pompous, ostentatious, and not to Emet-Selch’s tastes at all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch entered the room carefully."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch, however, had lived through many an empire now, many a mortal life."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The real Solus had looked forward to their union and Emet-Selch, over the ages, had become a talented actor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She didn’t hide what she wanted from him, and too late Emet-Selch realized this was her ploy all along."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Do not presume to speak of my future,” Emet-Selch hissed, the flaming visage of his mask fading as he shrugged at her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch began to chuckle, breaking through the silence that had taken between them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch smirked triumphally, throwing his arms out to his sides with a playwright’s sense of grandeur, “You see, my dear?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “No…No, No, NO, NO!” Emet-Selch ground his teeth, the desire to kill burning hot within his chest, veins."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch clenched his fists, his body betraying him—why was this so hard, why was he having regrets?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch covered his eyes, blinding Light erupting from the hero opposite of the platform."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He was familiar, but Emet-Selch couldn’t place him-not a Scion?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Gah, a...a trick of the light,” Emet-Selch brought his gloves to his eyes, covering himself from her view."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “How did—” Emet-Selch clicked his tongue, straightening himself to his full height."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Ascian could sense his swell of aether, the Allagan magicks heaving from his soul into the air, “I cannot well leave matters half finished.” Emet’s eyes narrowed, “Let expanse contract, eon become instant.” Emet-Selch felt the rage return, pooling into his chest, his aether."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch,” Emilia ripped her blade from the ground, swinging it back upon her shoulders with the ease of a seasoned guardian."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His teeth bore as he smirked, wild, “I, am Hades.” His voice fell, a rumbling, powerful bass, mimicking the call of Zodiark in his mind, “Paragon, Architect."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She knew it was futile, of course; Emet-Selch, Hades, was so much stronger than she’d thought, than she, they, could be."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Should I surrender this fight, what will become of it all..?” She looked up to the creature, the arcane entity...Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Please, Emet-Selch,” Her eyes were raw with tears, voice weak, cracking."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The tears were making it harder and harder to see him, “P-Please stop this, we will find a way,” She managed to turn her jaw from the ground, pushing herself to her elbows, “I-I will help you, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades aether had engulfed them, but the Light burned harder, brighter, searing through the dark with unrelenting speed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He could feel himself grasping for it, the crystal, the blade, but it was gone—torn through him.Hades could feel a deep chill running over him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch lowered his hood, the cloth of the Ascians now admonished upon his skin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades knew."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’ eyes examined her, trying to read the meaning between her words, but he couldn’t sense it, not as he had before."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades chuckled, “If you are offering me a chance into the Lifestream, Hydaelyn, you waste my time.” The very thought of her extending that choice, extending compassion, made rage roll through him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’re saying,” Hades tapped his temple in contemplation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Aye, sir,” Hades could feel his mind beginning to weaken, stretched beyond its limits, “Lyrne, send word to the infirmary that we will arrive, we’ve a man in need of medical attention.” “Can you hear me, Emet-Selch?” Hades did try to move his arms, head, but something pulled against it-choking the air in his throat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades groaned."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades took note of the chill, groaning inwardly at himself; both of his arms had been bolted to the wall, tethered by an odd, swirling expanse of reddened, aetheric metal."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked back to the room; it slanted upon itself, curving to a drain near the center."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a sigh, Hades averted his gaze to himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades felt his back beginning to stiffen, an abstract reminder to the discomforting way in which he’d been sleeping for…how long had he been unconscious?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades reached deep into his soul."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could feel his eyes stinging, unrelenting wrath bubbling."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades contemplated his appearance, surprised to note that he’d healed, quite considerably, from the state he’d last witnessed the miqo’te in."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch,” The Exarch began, stepping aside to allow entrance to his charge, “I’ll skip the pleasantries, if I may.” Hades chuckled, gesturing with his fingers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The woman’s faded eyes looked back to the Ascian, “I believe I inquire for all of us when I ask, Emet-Selch, be it we’ve all borne witness to your passing, but how is it that you still live?” As she turned back to Hades, Y’shtola took a step forward."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Exarch looked back to the white-haired man then to Hades, a sense of exasperation airing about his posture."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And those involved parties may be who, Emet-Selch?” “It’s him.” G’raha’s face stiffened, “...Emet-Selch.” Hades lulled his head back to the door, watching the flicker of the lamp upon the wall."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He’d been open to this prospect; over the course of their journey on the First, Emet-Selch had divulged all of which he could, more or less at the expense of his own life."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could almost laugh, had he the strength."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades winced as his chest pulled at his stiches, his breath heavy and labored."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades knew this hero, this Warrior amongst ilk, was all but a vessel, a Seraph of the Mother’s will and ever waning strength."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades turned back to the bars, wincing as his head, his chest, pulled upon his wounds."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watched as a ginger-haired miqo’te knelt to the bars to his hold."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Upon a second glace, Hades realized that his aether admonished the same brightness as she-the blessing, though faint in comparison to his mentor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I,” The Paragon tilted his head as a greeting, “Am Emet-Selch, though I believe you seem to recall well enough.” “Obviously,” Hades gestured to the binds on his wrists with a manner of soured disdain."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And it seems you can as well,” Hades snapped."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades felt his expression placate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" First, I'm sorry if you feel I'm punished Emilia or Hades a little too much in these first two chapters, I'm a little worried about these scenes coming across that way, but...In my opinion, after the MSQ ended and these two experienced what they have, I'd imagine what would follow to be not only painful but a little bit scary."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emilia is near dying from aether use, Hades was run through with a cleaver, I mean...I feel it only fair to portray these things to make a setting for what will come as we continue."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" D’ve had tried seeking other sources, when the written documents began to lessen, but Emet-Selch had been moved, thus complicating his search."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He’d warned him, but now Hades’ bright, beaming soul was dissipating unto the rift, the void calling and welcoming him as it had the others, his brethren."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I see Oblivion has claimed him.” A singe of regret colored his expression, “Emet-Selch-gone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ‘Twas too soon, Hades had much left to accomplish, redeem."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her mask shattered upon the floor, her soul blazing with vehement rage, at him, at Hades, her friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades concentrated upon his soul, his core."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was painfully amusing to observe the hostility between the Hyur and Exarch after his lecture, but Hades was grateful, in some regard."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades focused upon it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades mused, however, that with that shackle upon his powers, it could probably never attain its previous strength, not without the Father’s eventual interference."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades found himself smirking as he began to remove himself from his core, his soul."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades closed his eyes and braced himself for the vertigo that would come upon his reawakening."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades clenched his teeth as he dropped forward, bracing his fall with his outstretched hands and bent knees."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a snarl, Hades slammed his fist into the crystalline floor, uncaring of the pain that would follow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades clenched his fists, blood had begun to flow from his now rapidly swelling hand, “I never said I would assist you or your champion.” Hades clenched his teeth and began to rise from the floor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In his previous state, Hades had held the ability to sense aether, it’s colors."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Well,” Hades leaned back slightly, resting himself upon the tops of his heels."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades made move to stand as the hero turned back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The ginger miqo’te’s eyes narrowed as they continued to move, “Emilia specifically asked to see you, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Perhaps another time would be best for your questions.” Hades could feel himself trying to building up his own aether, despite the fact that he yet had the control, or ability, to wield it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades chuckled, looking down to her, “Need I truly answer that, hero?” Hades returned his gaze to her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could feel cold anger beginning to boil within him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Enough, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Without his magicks, his aether, Hades-though reluctant to admit-was in no state to argue."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" -Hades has been moved to a more stable environment in the Crystal Tower, though it was D've's insistence, the Exarch conceded thus he can keep a closer watch on him (plus he's a soft potato who, even against an enemy, I don't feel would be so cruel to leave him bolted to a wall...)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" -If you are wondering, yes, the wound Hades wore at the end of the Dying Gasp is the same which both he and the Warrior of Light have, one being real and the other being a metaphorical representation of her soul."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With Hades' aether sight (which they discuss in the short read Through His Eyes on the Lodestone), he is able to see that fragmentation in Emilia's soul."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She has a lot of emotional\/memory luggage tied with all the people she's had to kill, witness dying, etc, and no matter the circumstances, she wouldn't have wanted the same for our dear Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The group stood within the ring of the Ocular.Much like the fashion in which they had upon his first appearance with the troupe, Hades stood at the center’s most edge, the West, with Scions encasing the positionals around him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A few wandering eyes roved to the Warrior, taking in her state, “We could begin with the Tempest,” Y’shtola spoke, “There’s much of our time there that we can reflect on, explain, now that Emet-Selch has returned.” If he’s back,” She gestured to Hades, “Then we need to prepare for what comes next."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Right you are,” Hades snapped, sending a glare to the Hyur."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I couldn’t tell if they were perhaps Emet-Selch or Emilia, their figures looked the same, but-” “Undone is a term one could use to describe it, yes.” Hades looked to the hero as well, watching as she breathed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades made to respond, but Alphinaud interjected, “I-I don’t think that’s a good idea, he-” Hades crossed his arms, shaking his head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “As unwavering as your resolve may be, hero, let us wait,” Hades stated, “As you are, and even if I had the ability to use my aether, you wouldn’t be able to withstand the sheer process."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades pinched the bridge of his nose."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “E-Emet…Selch.” Hades sighed, “Your hero, her soul."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though I think the evidence may speak for itself,” Hades set his jaw, “More or less, your hero's soul is eating away at her vessel.” Hades stepped forward, watching as the hero’s eyes watered in pain."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades bent the same, clutching his ribs with a sharp inhale of breath."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This was only solidifying Hades’ stay with them, solidifying his involvement."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The text glowed as he opened it, a dark sheen of green and blue shining over its pages, “Can you wield your aether through someone else, Emet?” If the crystalline Mother sought Emet-Selch from the rift in act to aid in our avail, then we should allow him an opportunity to make amend.” Hades watched as the Exarch’s fists clenched."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Can you hear me, hero?” Emilia swallowed as Emet-Selch addressed her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It will,” Emet-Selch stated."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch nodded, gesturing to his book, “The summon, if you please.” Hades sucked in a breath and removed the glove from his left, extending it atop the miqo’te’s outstretched pair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With his utmost focus, Hades bore down upon a set to his left, tethered to his rib, and began to will his magicks to his shoulder, his forearm, fingers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades settled then, stretching his ankles and hands, allowing them to loosen before returning the pairs to cross at his feet and his wrists, the latter supporting the back of his head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could sense a hue of gold, as if a sunset, standing at the base of his legs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades snapped his focus into the chain, willing himself into the spaces, the gaps, with the power he could feel building beneath his palm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The miqo’te tensed as a sudden shiver ran through his arm, but Hades pushed faster than he could recoil, snagging the networks of his aether like a vice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades tensed at the contact, “Must you always laugh at my expense?”  Hades felt his cheeks gain heat, he knew what he was referring to."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh, Hades~” Hythlodaeus grasped ahold of his rib, breathing hard."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watched on as purpled aether swelled into the chain, mingling with the blued luminosity of the blessing he felt ever present upon the latter half of his body."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Why are you still here, Emet-Selch?” Hythlodaeus stood at his doorway, a hand resting upon his hip in speculating, calculated worry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I’ll not approve another of these,” Hades swung an arm at a collection of files, “Not until that...that imbecile can make well to do it with his  own  hand, not hers!”  “Hades,” His friend took a step inside, holding a finger out in warning, “You and I both know that you’d do well to quell that anger of yours, lest she sense it from the Akademia."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades recoiled from within himself, turning from the chains and out to the flow he now felt within his left arm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My aether will enter here,” Hades gestured over her wrist, “I’ll be as fast as I can."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades pushed deeper, emerging within the void at his core."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades began to build up his aether, searching for the chains, the spaces, which he’d sensed in her from his prison."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades tread slowly, moving to the edge of the purpled, gnarled hole which he’d seen torn through her center."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades felt his heart beginning to pound."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" From his station, Hades could see the small smile at Elidibus’ lips, the pride, and it, too, fed to his own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch,” The Speaker gestured to him, watching skeptically."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades pinched his eyes shut, tears beginning to well in his eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades swallowed his nerves as he descended the staircase, his fists clenching in anxious, feverous è̴̛͎̬̰̥̯̖͛̌͑̀́̃̿̀x̵͉̗̝̥̹̣͈̲̖̅̐̈́̑́̉͋͋̄c̷̖̣͙̰̊̀̀̂̚ī̸͎̐͋͝t̶͚̱͊̔͗̎͐̎̏́͝ẽ̸̙̳̤̣̖̖̦̇́̎̍̒͆̐͘͝m̵͓͙͚̙̫͇̪͉͋ë̶̡̧͈̖͇̗́̈́͗͊̾͂̀͜͝ͅn̴͉͔͎̗͉̂̅̃ẗ̴̞̬̳̞̦̺́̐̍̓̅̀̂͛͊͝.̴̟͚͖͓̺̯̤͗ The woman’s eyes watched him, him ȧ̶̬͖͙̲̩̺̦̘̳̆̎̃̉̅ṅ̵̳͑̀̂͂d̷̬̩̯͖̤̽͗͗͒̔̃͋̚̕ ̸̧̱̘̪͓̫̻̬̟̊͐̓̓̿̈́͊ͅǫ̵̮̟̘̼͆̎͌̍́͒͘ǹ̶̤̩͈̱̗̰̉̚͜͝ͅl̸̼̳̹͕͗ỹ̸̧̘͙͙̟̠̜̤̳̈́͋͗̂̈́̋ ̵̝̻̣̤̣̏̓̌̆̐̍̿͝h̴̛̛̠̰̤̟̙̠͕͌͆̽̏̄̽̕͘i̷̟͉̗̥̟̘̎m̸̢̫̹͓̲̞̞̱̔̀͆͂̽̄̚͜, as he approached her landing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Brilliant blue eyes locked onto his gold, gleaming, “ Emet-Selch,” She bowed as he moved to kneel before her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch!” Hades looked up to her, “May the star guide you upon your path, my dear.” Needless to say, it was a mixture of memories, both from Hades, D've, and Emilia, mingled with the aether conjoining and well, the big realization at the end of the chapter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Be warned, there are scenes of self harm in the selections containing Hades awakenings."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades gripped at his chest, shaking."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch, explain what’s going on,” The Exarch held his staff at the ready, moving to touch the Warrior’s shaking arm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch, he stopped it!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could feel his chest heaving, hyperventilating."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “E-Emet-Se...selch…h-how?” Hades jerked his head to his side, coughing violently."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades clutched at his head, burrowing his nails to his skin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He was Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The hero couldn’t speak of it with the others, and hadn’t, though she supposed they had theories of her plight, at least, particularly after her admission to Ryne, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Why…did Hydaelyn bring Emet-Selch back?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She was the Warrior of Light, Darkness; Emet-Selch fixed her, her soul was mended, keep on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch had recognized something there, during their joining in the Ocular."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades opened his eyes to the room, blurry though they’d be at their inspection."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could picture it, the glimpse of her soul in his recreated, burning Amaurot, the shade that watched him, spoke to him, calling out for his penance, his understanding."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was a fool."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades knew he’d been, he’d born that knowledge for…eras, lifetimes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For the first time, Hades felt…doubt—doubt for his cause, his brethren, their work."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades clenched his fist, anger beginning to rile in him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He’d come to read on his watch, it’d seemed, “I know thee is lost within the thralls of something, Emet-Selch, and though I cannot say of the magnitude,” He bent down upon his knee, a look of compassion and pain writ upon his face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades felt his mouth twist into a broken smirk, “Boredom sometimes takes us in different manifestations, Astrologian."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades took it weakly, “If what the others say of thee is true and you are returned to us of the Mother’s will, then I feel wholly of myself that thee does not wish to endue her further harm.” He watched as the Ascian haphazardly wiped at his face, “Thee conceded to assist us in her most pressing moments, after all, warned us of such in the Ocular.” Urianger shook his head as he placed the food at Hades’ side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “The melodramatic metaphor won’t aid you in your cause,” Hades gestured his gaze down to the loaf, “I’ll not be acting to break bread with you, or your precious Scions.” Hades watched as he left the tomes and continued, removing himself from Ascian’s chamber with another, hopeful, bow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In regard to Hades speaking on temperment, I truly feel that if one was tempered-as long as he-they would have some sudden realizations and breathability in their thoughts, their actions, once (even a fraction) has been removed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Also, I loved the last few sentences with Urianger and Hades and I'm glad my sleep deprived brain pulled that out...lol."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Breaking Bread ='s Peace but Hades is like the God of the Underworld...so...I felt it ironic."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh...I also have a random dance RP conversation\/story I’ve fleshed out with IRL D’ve, which involves Emilia\/Hades and D’ve\/Urianger...would you guys maybe like a little sauce to hold you over before it happens here?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" D’ve had meant what he said when he’d witnessed Emet-Selch’s return; enemy or no, he was glad Hydaelyn granted her that much."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Scions had told him Emet had become unstable after he and Emilia’s exchange in the Ocular, that it was best he would be accompanied if seeing him—seemed he was much like Emilia in that respect; like teacher like student."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" D’ve took a step inside, shocked to find Emet laying curled upon a solider cot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Is that why you’ve come, to inquire after my health?” Emet rolled his eyes, “Well, I believe your Astrologian did just that.” His gaze gestured to a stack of books at his side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, again, rolled his eyes, “If that’s all, leave me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Considerate of you.” Hades looked up as the miqo’te reached his bedside, bending and resting upon his knees, fingers grazing absently over the spines of his newly delivered tomes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked over to the Summoner, caught off guard by his admittance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades set his jaw, “’Tis not in my best interest, as you may realize.” Hades loathed disarray, disorganization—he wanted to think through his strategies, the consequences and steps each would need, each would result."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was her enemy, both in blood and name, in every respect—Hydaelyn’s chosen versus Zodiark’s vessel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades felt a chill settle within his stomach."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And you deign to implore me for your Champion’s tale?” Hades feigned a chuckle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades clenched his teeth, “And what would you know of that, hm?” Hades knew, he knew that look of weight, contemplation—he was judging his truth, his accounts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades wet his lips, wincing at the dryness in his throat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Can…Can I ask you one last thing, Emet?” Hades turned his gaze to him, keeping his head facing forward, “If you must.” Hades watched as, oddly enough, the hero stumbled forward."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “E-Emet-Selch, D’ve?” How could Hades even look at her, knowing what lied beneath her fragmentations, the light?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How do you fare, Emet?” “I’m fine, hero.” Hades felt his jaw twitch, his voice strain."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watched as the hero simply stood, streams of tears spilling over her cheeks, pooling and falling at her jaw, chin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades felt his chest tighten, breath catching as surges of aether pulsed down the chain, stronger now that she had become closer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch felt the pulses deaden as she began to lean into the wall, the rawness of their urgency weaken, if only slightly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could see faint glimmers radiate across her soul; unsteady blues, greens telling of worry, fear, yellows of guilt, a twinge of oranged amusement."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked back to the hero to see the color, once again, drained from her face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades felt a frown etch upon his face; what was preoccupying her?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Sorry to have bothered you,” Emilia rose from the floor and offered the Ascian a slight bow of her head, reaching to take support from the shoulder of her student, “Sleep well, Emet-Selch.” I apologize, again, if this may bother anyone but I didn't feel that work reflects the thoughts or scenes I've put to context here-especially Emilia and Hades, and I wanted this fiction to stand alone in it's own universe."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Again, thank you so so much for all of the lovely comments (both from those reading and from the the beautifully supportive Emet-Selch Discord <3)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He’d been sure Emet-Selch had left out some of the more important details of their journey, of himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch explained that he sought the Scions in the Crystarium after hearing of the deeds of Emilia, after witnessing their beginnings on the First."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet didn’t seem to remember much of the time before their partnership, he and the Scions, but his ignorance was easily feigned—D’ve believed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet’s words stuck with him; if he, if the Ascians, the beginning people could be tempered, those perfect, immortal beings-was he, Emilia, tempered as well?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a shaky hand, she reached to take support from the shoulder of her student, leaving him with that obscured shade—a glimmer caught between herself and what she was, “Sleep well, Emet-Selch.” Hades blinked wearily, staring up at the crystalline ceiling."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades clenched his jaw—he’d felt it, the sudden fear, the grief; overpowering, hideous in its suddenness, it’s disgusting weight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I trust thee hath slept well?” Hades felt his chest stutter at the intrusion."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades frowned; he’d slept well through another day."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They sat in silence as Hades’ chest rose and fell, anger dripping from his visage in waves, rolling and churning beneath his skin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades wished the tempering could have remained, if only of modicum of it—the Father’s influence would salve him, make it hurt less to still believe her gone, to still think her swallowed by the Fall."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades flinched at the idea—she was of eight, was she not?She’d rejoined with her shards, those wayward souls—did that mean upon reaching the final, she…she would be returned?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades bit down on his lip, fighting the wave of agony, guilt, that’d accompanied his wistfulness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Urianger turned a page in his text, “I, again, would expect no less of thee to fight it.” Hades swallowed his retort, making to pull himself from the bed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked down, taking in the deterioration of his muscle, the bones that had come to protrude from his chest, shoulders."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades scoffed and gestured down to his hands, “When can these accursed things come off?” Hades, hesitantly, drank down its contents, gasping in refreshment as the elezen removed it once more, emptied."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades wiped the residue from the corners of his lips, “If…if you would.” Hades watched after him as the door opened, the white haired Hyur standing upon the other side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As the others took places amongst the ring, he and Emet-Selch met gazes, staring in silent contempt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They sat in silence, waiting, Emet and company watching as he shifted down the stairs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades crossed his arms atop his chest, fighting the urge to look at the hero, her soul."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades leaned his head back in contemplation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades jaw clenched as he glared at the red-haired male, “You cannot be proposing what I think you mean to…” The room quietened as they turned to him, shocked by the sudden remark, the venom in his voice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “As a cause of yourself,” The Exarch shot back, “We’ve little option left to us, Emet-Selch, and I feel this matter be that of our concern, not yours.” Hades stepped forward, golden eyes burning, seething in their intensity, “You of all should know the cost of traversing the rift, Exarch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades wanted to wince as she walked over to him, pushing the red-clad twin behind the safety of her back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If Emet-Selch can repair but a fraction more of your soul, then it should hold well enough to bring you back to the Source."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades felt his heart clench as the hero turned back to him, the heat in her eyes tearing through his resolve as if it was no more than dust."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch?” Hades frowned as the grief, hot and acidic, began to color over the cesious sheen he witnessed before him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades scowled, “I take it that’s my cue to contribute once more to our conversation?” Emilia frowned as she watched Emet-Selch take himself from D’ve’s arm, a swelter of amaranthine aether coloring the space between his mangled hand and the miqo’te’s tattooed skin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch winced as he leaned away, breathing as heavily as the Summoner."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though it’s weakened compared to what I…should be able to imbue, it acts well enough for this purpose.” Emet grunted as he shifted towards her, holding out his arm with the support of his left forearm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My vessel lives because of it, does it not?” Hades quipped, turned back to the Warrior of Light, “I do need to make contact, hero, as distasteful as it may be for you.” Hades took in a breath as he retreated back within his core, relieved by the pool of aether that rose in turn to greet him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades trudged himself forward through their connection, emerging within the broken, collapsed pathways of her aethereal networks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades took in a steadying breath as he stepped across the broken floor, furrowing his brow as the gold began to fade, giving way to fragmentations, fissures among the wall, the ground."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades froze."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could feel the colors the melody evoked of his memory."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had hardened his course after witnessing it, feeling the warmth of it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades ran his weary, tired hands through the length of his hair, resting his head defeatedly upon the rack of the piano."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hyth shook his head, chuckling, “You’re trying too hard, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades felt his cheeks darken at the memory, shamefully so."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades froze as the music stopped, realization dawning that he’d come full circle to the center of the hero’s aether, standing dumbstruck amongst chains and shards of her soul."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades reached out and began pressing his essence into the bindings, working towards the shards he could see extending from the wound at her center."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though I must confess, I didn’t realize you were a performer, Hades?” Of course she’d know, she was the amphitheaters’ best patron—why did Hades think this was a good idea?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades averted his eyes immediately, stepping back in his embarrassment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I didn’t mean to frighten you, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It’s fine,” Hades interjected, fearful he’d offended her, “I…I think it’s fine.”  “Oh?” Hades continued forward."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades gasped as he felt his aether rebuked from within the hero, chimes and splintering brightness overpowering what little his eyes could manage to see."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Elidibus told me before,” Hades mused, extending his hand beside her own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades smiled and pushed back the rack for his sheet music, exposing the hammers, strings, and harp that made up the inside body of the instrument."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The dampeners that rested beneath the strings side-stepped all at once, releasing their grip from the strings and allowing the notes Hades pressed to vibrate freely, ringing for more than twice the worth they'd been before."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “’Tis quite the creation,” Hades smiled as she reclined back onto the bench, sitting alongside him with a soft thump."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades sensed his aether fading from within the hero’s core, the fragments of her soul clicking and rejoining as his essence was thrust in finality from the wound."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades scowled as he looked at her torso, surprised to find their tether absent from the space between them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Thank you, Emet-Selch.” The Summoner looked up from his mentor’s shoulder, offering him a tired smile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus had not the ability to witness the essence that Emet-Selch could, at least no longer, but the pull of this hero was as he’d initially believed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This had been his fear, knowing how Hades would seek her once freed, liberated of his temperament—he was of sound mind, but the danger that could present was paramount."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Father was right; he needed Hades to entreat him, seek him, for sake of their brethren, the Rejoining, and he would only do so if driven to his limits, if provoked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The musical aspects in this chapter really made me giddy to write coming from and studying as a professional musician, so I hope they give you the fuzzy good feels as much as they did for me~ little bb Hades...getting picked on by Perse...I live for it...hehehe."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s gloved hands ran through the crown of his wine-colored hair, a sigh escaping his lips, “You think it unfair that you are subject to suffering?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" From the corner of her eye, Emet-Selch sneered and stormed forward to the center of the room, throwing his arm to his chest with a heavy thump."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet didn’t speak to them in this way, with mocking, melodramatic humor, yes, but not with this sudden, vehement rage, not with this weight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch sneered, pulling her close enough that she could feel his breath on her face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades brow furrowed as he watched their exchange."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As he continued to watch, Hades confirmed it; something was…covering the sheen of the hero’s soul, like a shade or a curtain."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades made move to stand, but the ginger-haired Summoner stopped him, “Let me help you.” Hades scowled as he held out his arm, allowing D’ve to take hold of his bicep."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades frowned as Emilia looked to him, the blue of her eyes gleaming against the crystal of the Ocular."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could feel his chest tightening—it was wrong of him to feel so by her attentions."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Regardless,” Emilia replied, unwavering in her gaze, “Emet-Selch has helped to stabilize my soul."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades felt as though he was staring at his sins, as if he was reading his own ledger, dripping, reeking, swathed with the blood and death from eons of wrongs, of tempered hatred and pain."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades sat quietly in his room, glaring down at his swathed hands."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades didn’t know this shard, he didn’t know the tribulations she’d fought through, the battles she’d endured, the heartache; it wasn’t his place, but he was selfish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had stayed for a margin of the remaining’s discussion, but opted for his rooms once he felt their wells of information had run dry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a start, Hades looked up at his guest, shocked to find that very same blue, silver soul standing in his entryway."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades took in a shuddering breath, watching as the Warrior’s soul churned against her vessel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades scowled, looking down at them himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades scowled, looking over the clothes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Everything fits well enough,” Hades replied, looking at his own appearance, “Though I’ll admit I...didn’t know you studied in the arts of tailory?” Hades frowned."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch,” Y’shtola began, watching as the hero strode past them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades felt himself prickle at her implication."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades felt coolness seep into his visage, despite the layers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades scowled as they embarked from the courtyards, Scions in tow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch and I. Hades felt his heart stop, shuddering—surely…surely he was mistaken."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watched as she turned her gaze to him, then to the staircase behind, gesturing for him to follow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch stalked behind her, watching in quiet, brooding silence as she looked to the trees, the trails."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch looked to her, eyebrows knitting in confusion."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch turned his head, looking away as she’d met with his gaze."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades felt his throat grow dry, “What do you mean?” Emet-Selch nodded, “In earnest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Finally getting some WOL and Emet's interaction... :eyes: There's more to come!I am a tad anxious to see how this chapter is received...I feel like it has a lot of little blurbs rather than long sequences of things, so it's a little different than previous chapters."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet gets punched."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Warrior of Light began with the gaps in her memory; there weren’t many, judging by how much Hades realized she could remember, but there was enough."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades met her gaze and nodded, “You have the right of it.” Hades bit his lip, deliberating."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The lack of response was unsettling and for a moment, Hades feared he’d perhaps went a little too far in his admissions, “He’d planned to commit suicide, yes?” She was looking back to him again, watching."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades thought it in response to his own pacing’s, but she paused, taking a seat along a series of stones washed upon the graveled sand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stepped forward but made no move to take her offer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades peeled his gaze from the landscape and back to the Warrior, “If there is more you needs’t ask, then by all means, do so.” Hades watched her uncertainty, almost amused by the apprehension in her voice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades swallowed and pushed down the irritation he felt building in his chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “The child bandaged the cracks, mayhap.” Hades voice rung cool, “I know not the true state of your soul when arriving in the Tempest, true enough, but without her full power all your Oracle’s Light could do was salve the symptoms of your overburdened soul.” Her chest puffed as she breathed—he’d clearly touched a nerve."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades took in a breath, leaning forward to rest his elbows upon the tops of his thighs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Perhaps,” Hades cleared his throat, looking back up to the moon."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’ll be okay, Hades, please.” Her gloved hands rested atop his own, threading between his fingers with a comforting, gentle warmth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades shook his head and pressed into her, coaxing his legs betwixt her own in a slow, meticulous step."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades set his jaw, breathing deep the scent of her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades took in a breath, pressing her back flush to his chest and wall behind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch?”  “H-Hades, let us go home.” Her voice shook as he began to lap at her throat, biting and tasting her skin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet.” Hades looked up, around, shocked to find the Warrior of Light bent upon a knee before him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her lips were drawn into a thin, worried line, brows furrowed in much the same fashion, “Emet, are you alright?” His soul felt empty without her, worsened by the similarly swathed hero now seated before him—a cruelty, to the pain that now radiated in him, “W-Well enough, hero.” Hades’ voice cracked as he pulled away from her outstretched hand, eyes narrowing, “Let us make haste."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades brows shot upwards."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades took in a deep breath, ascending the first of the Crystal Tower’s many, winding staircases."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades scowled, plateauing upon a long stretch of crystalline hallway."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The problem was Hades was at a loss for how to proceed with those topics, let alone the hero’s sudden interrogations."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of course Hades couldn’t very well tell her of the dialogue she’d shared with the shades in Amaurot, which he knew she would ask of him be it he began to explain their visit there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades released a breath he wasn’t even aware he’d been holding."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To the matter at hand, Hades could just tell her what he knew; without the temperment of his Father rampaging at the forefront of his mind, the end of their tale in the Tempest was an obscure enough one to give him just a modicum of flexibility in the retelling."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of course Hades would never be sure, having been lost of his own will, thoughts, for so long, but now…now he hoped in a small, perverse part of himself that that was indeed the case."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades clenched his jaw, closing his eyes from the bright, iridescent lighting the Tower used to illuminate the halls."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Since their previous session of “soul repair,” the hero had been watchful of the ways in which Emet-Selch carried himself, or the lack thereof."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch could see it, after all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch would be unlikely to regain his aethereal powers any time soon so his absence was of naught to fear as well, but she needed to be careful."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A paragon of the Ascians resurrected, and in the name of the one they so vehemently opposed, would very well carry back to him, particularly if the communities of the First began to recognize Emet-Selch for what or who he was."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If you guys are on the search for a wonderful, inclusive, and supportive Emet\/FFXIV fanfic community, I urge you to come by this discord!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch winced as he leaned back against the wall of the Ocular."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was beginning to remember just how tedious his previous lives had been, how exhaustive, annoying and short."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades scowled—he didn’t really have any options left to him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Without his cause, or any need for it, Hades would never be able to fully take back his abilities, his self."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watched on from between his fingers, observing as the Scions and company began to gather around the northern-most podium in the room."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades didn’t recognize the text, but he could see the ancient magicks working about the miqo’te’s crimson-hued soul."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Now that he was afforded a curfew, Hades supposed he could spend a modicum of his time satisfying his curiosities regarding the Tower."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked around, counting the heads in the room."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades clenched his teeth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades lowered his hand to his throat, swallowing in an effort to clear it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked around for effect, gesturing, “I see all of your companions are here.” “Interesting.” Hades hummed, “Considering how she’d reacted to the prospect of those two leaving before.” “How long?” Hades almost flinched at how desperate his voice sounded."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades leveled his gaze, “May I join you?” Her brow furrowed as Emet-Selch’s gaze met with her own, bright and speculatively gold between the other array of eyes which now beheld her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We were fully prepared to allow you a moment for yourself, after…after everything, but…well, Emet-Selch insisted we intervene.” “Apologies, Warrior of Light, but I had…” Emet-Selch paused, searching for the words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “…And full glad are we for Emet-Selch’s interference.” Alisaie interjected, placing a hand on her hip."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch and the elezen paused, the other Scions now included, before looking back to her with raised brows."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Something in Emet-Selch’s gaze hardened, “I agreed to work with your ilk."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Also, if you guys are on the search for a wonderful, inclusive, and supportive Emet\/FFXIV fanfic community, I urge you to come by and join this discord!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch watched on as the hero’s charge began working over her unconscious form, now lain like a corpse across the surface of her bed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In some manner or another, Hades recalled the phenomena of aether depletion was most akin to what mortals considered the flu."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Vaguely, somewhere in the corner of his mind, Hades wondered if Persephone had ever had a choice in the figures her soul shards inhabited."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades sighed, stretching and twisting his legs, satisfied by the popping sound the bones produced in turn."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watched as the Scions slowly began to filter from the room, leaving one by one until he, the seer, and the Astrologian were all that remained."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Right to it, are we?” Hades mocked, scowling as he readjusted his back to the chair behind him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could feel himself withdrawing.In all manner of truth, how was he to answer that?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “As I see it, your collective has been just as discreet as I in your reiterations of recent events,” Hades scoffed, looking back to the miqo’te, “At least in what you’ve told to your Champion.” Emet-Selch felt discomforted by the sudden tone in which the taller took."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watched on between them, calculating, but when Urianger spoke again, he seemed reproachful, quiet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades felt his eyes widen, “And what have I to do with any of this?” “With no challenge to this truth, we’ve reached an impasse.” He sighed, “As I have spoken before, Emet-Selch, we seeketh the same."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’ve told you what I know and that which I’ve witnessed, even as much as our history.” Emet-Selch quipped, airing on annoyed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watched as the miqo’te gestured down to the hero."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could feel his heart stutter, the anxiety that’d built in his stomach now present and nauseating in its strength."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Their worry was validated, and shared; Elidibus, as concerned as he was for balance and his own carefully laid constructs, would have to unveil himself to repair Hades’ failure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His essence was dense, twice so as Hades’ own, it’d take a sweltering of those tiny gems to match his power and that alone was not an option they had."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That is a possibility,” Hades mused."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “…I’ve a proposition, but it would require audience with the Exarch.” Hades swallowed, none too keen on the thought of having to appeal to the miqo’te, particularly with their recent history."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That city, that place that Emet-Selch spoke of."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch bid them to come find him, for her to come find him, once she’d descended into madness from the overabundance of Light."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades paced about his chamber’s, wringing his hands as he waited."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Another sigh, and Hades began to set about gathering a pair of clothes for the day, ridding himself of the old."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Throwing them down beside the bath, Hades began to undress from the thin cotton top and bottoms he slept in, slipping his body beneath the water’s surface."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was slightly discontented by the idea of it, but he supposed it was fair enough—if they were going to plan for these future endeavors it would do well to know the state of the Scions vessels."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If Hades still had his abilities, he could prove to be of use to the Scions; it would be so much easier for him to seek them out, amplifying his sight with magic, but at this point their only hope would be to implore the strength of the Crystal Tower, or the Oracle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If the Exarch would consent, then Hades could begin working through the Tower’s inner machinations, researching just how that miqo’te managed to transport the Warrior and her company between stars."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It had been decades since he’d worked with Allagan technology and in truth, Hades had probably forgotten a large portion of its true workings—if given time, however, he could perhaps manage to rework it to the Scions benefit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was a whimsical plan, Hades knew, but at this point it seemed that was what the hero and her party were hoping for; they had nowhere else to turn."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Perhaps with the impending peril their situation presented them with the Exarch would be more likely to acquit to Hades’ suggestions, though he doubted, even still, that he would be willing to fully listen to him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Wringing what water he could from his hair, Hades shook and swept it over in its usual fashion, white forelock falling forward about his right eye."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Holding them up at his hips, Hades began rummaging through his remaining stack of clothes for the belt he’d received a few days prior."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades knelt down, scowling."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ah, good morning, Emet-Selch.” “Hm,” Hades stood and walked over to the boy, looking down at the plate as he approached."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades felt it was in an effort to save his hands, but he put the notion aside—he could have managed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could feel himself growing uncomfortable, tense, like he was privy to something he shouldn’t be."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hm, if so then Aemilius—where had he heard that before?Hades felt a familiar prick deep in his mind; a tome, then…Αιμιλία…Αίμα.Ah, emulate, though if memory served, the name translated to something more akin to rival.He scowled—how fitting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades brows shot up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ryne was waiting for them in the foyer, eager to seek out the new coffeecakes that’d been introduced in the local café—she’d agreed to go with her to get one, but she doubted Emet-Selch would want to indulge the Oracle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’m sure he doesn’t enjoy your sour attitude,” Emilia quipped, running a palm over the machinations of Emet-Selch’s door."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Across from her,s Emet-Selch sat waiting upon his cot, watching as the door swiveled and sealed shut in the same, sweeping gesture it’d opened with."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a breath, the Warrior of Light forced a smile and bowed in greeting, “Good morning, Emet-Selch.” The realization suddenly occurred to her that Emet didn’t seem to recognize the name—was it the same with all of the Scions?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch followed her appraisal of the room, “I take it that was the reason for the meal?” Hades watched as the pair in front of him continued bickering, chuckling as they exchanged quips of friendly, teasing banter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She’d always been willing enough to listen to his cause, when Hades had come to discuss or listen in on the Scions’ conversations, but never jovial such as this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For a moment, he even considered what may have happened be it he had approached their group differently, otherwise withheld of his Ascian nature and current vessel; would Hades of seen this side of the Champion, her friends?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It felt perverse, wrong, to suddenly be in their company, to think those thoughts, “Are you alright, Emet?” Hades turned, catching the hero’s bright, slitted blue eyes staring back at him, her brow furrowed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades fought a scoff—that was idiocy.Asking about her well-being would only come across as a condescending joke, or insincere at best—particularly around the Scions company."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Now Hades’ presence just served as a memory, a scar, reminding all of what he had tried to ruin and destroy in Zodiark’s name."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades paused as the group approached a bar-like stall near the top of the stairs, emerging from the markets below."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Gunbreaker stayed back, standing along Hades’ side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As they stood watching after his comrades, the Hyur’s trademark sour attitude—as Hades had come to know it as—drowned out his façade of pleasant comradery."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades raised a brow, “Pardon?” The look the shorter met him with implied what Hades had thought he’d been getting at, but it was no less annoying."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Forbidden from looking around, am I?” Hades mocked, glancing around for effect."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades felt his stomach knot at the name—so flippantly they tossed it out, did it not bother her?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The red-headed child nodded enthusiastically, placing each pastry atop a napkin and passing them along to each member of the table, Hades, surprisingly, first."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades didn’t really care much for cakes, the texture had always been slightly off-putting—never moist enough, never smooth, but in combination with the drink the flavor was, admittedly, pleasant."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was somewhat lost by what they were referring to, though he had heard the term, ‘The Empty,’ tossed around during their conversations in the Ocular."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watched as the hero began to close off from her comrades, her soul’s essence now turning over and blocking out it’s brilliant, cesious sheen from his view."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades cleared his throat, “Forgive me for the interruption, but could one of you clarify this…Empty?” “Then why make a deal over something like this, then?” Hades retorted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could almost chuckle—if it was a Lightwarden, no one else but their Champion could hope to face it down, be it her soul could even handle that wealth of Light anymore."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had yet to truly discuss with him his plans for said Tower, but he was hopeful in hearing that he’d begun to take steps in learning what the Allagan technologies could do for their plight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades pushed aside his plate and glass as he leaned back in his chair, stretching his legs beneath the table."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had already begun to feel jittery from the caffeine, especially now that it’d been introduced back to his system."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Are you alright, Emet?” As he averted his eyes, Hades took note that the two who had been seated with them previously were now absent."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watched as the hero leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms atop her chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades scowled, clenching his fists in his lap."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades leaned forward, pointing at his chest, “I’m an Ascian, I’ve attempted to kill you and your comrades, and very nearly succeeded.” When she made no comment he continued, “Your Scions don’t seem to have forgotten that much; I’m asking if you have.” Hades felt cool anxiety welling up in his chest, stomach, “I could still have ulterior motives, hero.” If so, then she was treating him the same as she did all of the broken, acrid husks of this star; it was an undeserved, pitiful act, “I don’t want the empathy.” Hades stated, “Keep it for the masses, not me.” Hades’ brows shot up; so the Champion of Hydaelyn did resent him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’ve known men who have committed murder for less of a whim, hero.” Hades retorted, “And it would have been deserved if so.” As the words left her lips, Hades felt a shiver run down his spine, breaking his skin into gooseflesh and cool, icy despondence."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This chapter also felt a little odd to write, I guess because I'm working more with Emet and Emilia's conversations, but I hope you guys like it!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It took a moment for Hades to find his words, “How…” His voice was dry, “How do you know that name?” The hero watched as Emet-Selch’s face paled, a hand reaching up to his collar."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It caught Hades off-guard, like a sudden warmth in a dark room, and for a split moment he felt the need to look away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked down at the table, fighting the emotions he could feel struggling to surface beneath his calm, tired façade."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Well, hero,” Hades rubbed his eyes, massaging and wiping over his face, sighing, “It would seem you were correct."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then two fell silent, Hades lost in his own memories, the Warrior of Light giving him breath before another line of inquiry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watched as she mulled through her thoughts, then centered back on herself, gesturing lightly, “From what I’ve noticed, Hythlodaeus only appears when everything in the city is destroyed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It’s…still hard to explain.” Hades watched as her mismatched locks fell over her shoulders, falling down into her face and eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades scoffed, fighting the urge to roll his eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We are trying to work past such misgivings, Emet, though if you’ll remember, the only interaction we’ve had with your kind has been at the other end of a blade.” Hades tried rummaging through his own memories, trying to pinpoint if something of this sort had occurred to the original Persephone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades and she and been hauled up with Igeyorhm and others at the Bureau of the Conservator, or the Akademia if he remembered, trying to find a means to delay their inevitable, buy Lahabrea and Elidibus more time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If this dream was likely a remnant of memory, Hades could only assume it was of the second Doom, not the first."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades thrummed his fingers against his chin, thinking."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades scowled, “Have you told your comrades, hero?” Wrapped up in the idea of discovery, in figuring out what these dreams were, what the city was, Emet’s question was out of place and altogether brought the hero’s churning thoughts to a stumbling, tripping halt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As the silence returned, it dawned upon Hades that with his comment, he must have fractured some means of…neutrality, between he and the hero."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The bright blue of the Champion’s eyes met his with a smug, familiar mischievousness and for a split moment, Hades forgot that she and Persephone shared a soul."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He’d been embarrassed by those eyes, that look, many a time, and the years didn’t seem to make him any less flustered, “D-Don’t make me repeat it, hero.” Hades waved his hand again, turning away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Your informants have only gazed at us from the tips of blades, my dear,” Hades mumbled, though he could feel his cheeks warming, “You said so yourself.” The gesture made Hades uncomfortable, like he’d forgotten to straighten a set of buttons, or left a stain upon his shirt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Repaired what I could manage, yes.” Hades rescinded, “I’ve not the power to mend you as you are, hero, not as I am now.” Hades watched as the hero spun, swinging her cleaver across, down, then forward through the rugged mannequin’s chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked up as the Warrior of Light dropped her blade, perching the tip down into the soft earth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This had become their normal routine—Hades, reading or researching whilst in the hero’s presence, normally outside, she working through exercises or training with her comrades on the Lakeland battlegrounds."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was strange, but Hades supposed being close to the hero, her shard, filled him with nostalgia he and Persephone’s days in the Akademia—staying up into the late hours of morning studying, creating, calculation or debating over common ideas or concepts they hoped to execute in class."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emilia hummed, stepping beneath the tree Hades had perched himself under."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked up at her, brow raised, “They’ll hand over their knowledge so easily?” Besides Emet-Selch, over the passing days, had divulged that he hoped to work through and reobtain some of the control on his aether."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet explained this to her comrades, who in turn gathered to the Exarch regarding this matter, who then, in turn, deemed it a cause necessary of their time and efforts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When unoccupied, Emet was expected to aid the Exarch in the tower, though they’d only just begun this agreement a night or two ago."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, bored now with the text in his hands, took to watching as the Warrior of Light moved, intrigued by her routine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watched as she repeated these newer movements, thinking back to their battle, together in the Tempest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As he’d come to accompany the Warrior of Light in her training, Hades had also come to notice trends, or habits, she seemed to have when going through her routines."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watched as she straightened herself, looking back at the book in his lap, “Nothing there either?” As Hades began to stack his tomes, Emilia collected her things and brought them over to her cleaver, bunching them up atop the ground she’d pierced for it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Will you perhaps join us, tonight?” Hades looked over as the Warrior of Light began repacking his satchel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I said before, they do not mean to judge, Emet.” “W—” Hades nearly dropped the book he was holding, now staring back at the hero with more than a measure of shock, “What?” Hades gathered himself and shook his head, chuckling dryly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades rolled his eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades swallowed, attempting to avert his eyes from her gripping, blue gaze."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Come now, Hades,” Persephone’s hands grasped around his wrists, small in their grip but strong, calloused, holding onto him tightly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’ eyes followed her own, confused; he could breathe again, but his lungs felt full of that scent, of her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had exchanged what he could at the libraries, lightening the load he now bore back to his rooms, but he didn’t hold much hope for these tomes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades grunted as he broached the final landing, arms now weary and weak from their trek through Lakeland and the Crystarium."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As Hades began to approach his rooms, he felt a tug of aether, familiar, strong, swell from beyond the hall’s threshold and forward, lunging deep into his chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A soft laugh filled his mind, “Emet-Selch.” Hades blood ran cold, his own miniscule spirit retreating and bowing in upon itself, hiding from the power he felt now reaching and tugging around from within him, searching, learning."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It’d been long since Hades had witnessed aether from a soul Unsundered, it was an unspoken taboo from their time in the Convocation, for any without bond, or love at least."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As Hades stepped inside, he locked eyes with the Emissary now standing near his cot, one of his books in hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades cleared his throat, stepping aside to place down the tomes he’d carried from the library."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As the tension in the room began to fade, Hades flinched as his essence began to stretch, grow within himself once more, “Mortal, yes.” A quell of anger rushed into Hades’ chest, pulsing hard and hot to the accusation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus paused as he begun to turn the page, looking back to Hades slowly, carefully."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You seem wary of me,” He stated, coolly, “I assure you, your tribulation against the Warrior of Light was by design, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could feel his fists shaking, trembling with a century’s worth of rage and sorrow, “Do not play games, Emissary.” A soft chuckle resounded from the white-robed man, “You say as such to me, Emet-Selch, yet look at you—catering the Mother, coddling and conforming to her Light-bearers as a stone in water, dissolving, weakening.” He turned fully, now, facing Hades as his head tilted in thought, the front of his red-beaked mask following, “Lord Zodiark has sensed your faltering,” He stated, calm, “I did not know to what extent, until I saw the bindings upon your aether, soul, for myself.” A pause, “She has gentled you, has she not?” When Hades didn’t respond, the Emissary chuckled, placing the tome he held back with others stacked upon the ground."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades hadn’t the strength to even fight back, withdraw his soul, as Elidibus searched through his essence, it was near obvious to see the Light staked within his aether, even for one without the Sight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “A shame, truly,” Elidibus mused, stepping forward, “I suppose that explains your topic of interest, as well?” Hades watched as he gestured to the new pile of books he’d placed upon the floor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Emissary flashed a soft smile, shrugging, “I came to offer succor to one of our own; despite this…misstep, you were resurrected, most eminent, Emet-Selch.” He flinched at his title, “Death would have provided us with yet another office to replace, fill—now, well…the rejoining of your aether ‘tis but a trivial chore.” Hades took a step back, deigning to create space between he and his comrade."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades paused in turn, realizing what he’d just done."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The stark disappointment that lit his voice stilled them both, weighing down the shorter man’s shoulders in a posture familiar to the mortal Ascian, “So very unlike you, Emet-Selch…’Tis so unlike you, to ‘err, so gravely.” Hades clenched his fists, reignited in his anger, “I do not require correction, Elidibus.” In that instant, Hades’ scarred, mangled hands wrapped around the base of the Emissary’s hood, jerking him back into the wall of his chambers with a hard, hollow, thud."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus chuckled as Hades’ hands dug against his flesh, pressing upon his throat with a force the mortal didn’t even know he still had, “Do not speak of her as if you are associated,” Hades hissed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Emissary wheezed, “I…shall endeavor not to, Emet-Selch, though a-answer me…” He chuckled again, fighting for air between the force closing down on his windpipe, “Is it for their C-Champion, whom you defend so readily, or the shard t-that will consume her upon their Rejoining?” Also, if you guys are on the search for a wonderful, inclusive, and supportive Emet\/FFXIV fanfic community, I urge you to come by and join this discord!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades clenched his fists, sitting up in his cot with a growl of frustration."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I…shall endeavor not to, Emet-Selch, though a-answer me…” The Emissary chuckled again, rasping, “Is it for their C-Champion, whom you defend so readily, or the shard t-that will consume her upon their Rejoining?”  Hades pressed his fingers further into the smaller man’s throat, growling, “Not even you could know what will happen once she’s whole, Elidibus.”  The red-beaked mask turned up to Hades in mock question, “But surely you see how foolish this endeavor is?”  A sudden wave of pain struck down Hades’ arm, causing the muscles within to spasm and jerk against his will."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Grumbling, Hades snapped out of bed and began pacing about his room."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades sneered, standing back on his feet, “Regardless, I’m sure you haven’t come all this way to palaver over souls, Emissary."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Your essence, Emet-Selch,” He stated, “Surely you have seen it, attuned as you are?”  Hades clenched his fists, of course he’d know."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For a fleeting moment, the mortal cursed himself for not having worked harder to shatter the remaining chains; the hero’s essence had taken up the majority of his efforts of late, granted, but still… They needed to buy time for her to heal, to regain her shards, and Hades needed to avert his attentions to the hold Hydaelyn seemed to have over his aether."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If the only reason you’ve come is to chide me over my choices and test my patience, you’ve done what you’ve sought to do.” Hades hissed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Hades made no move to respond, the white-clad Ascian held out his hand, lighting his palm once more with aether, “With my strength, I can assist you in freeing the last of your aether from Hydaelyn’s control."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I can see it, Emet-Selch, I know what you’ve lost upon awakening once more.” An Unsundered acting to do so as well, well…it was much too dangerous for him now, mortal as he was, though it was curious the Emissary continued to regard him as his own title, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Alive once more, and aether sealed, he could be risen again to the ranks of Emet-Selch again, with the risk of being…tempered, of course."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The idea of it, becoming a thrall to the Father, Zodiark, once more, even in the slightest, Hades could no longer chance—not now, not being aware of the things he has seen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No doubt Zodiark would wipe what he could of his mind upon the second tempering, to alleviate any question or hesitation in his loyalty—even as an immortal Hades was already a questionable follower, which he was sure both the Father and Elidibus knew."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus, too, had mentioned as much, questioning which one Hades hoped to awaken upon the gathering of the Warrior of Light’s soul shards."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades wanted to know, however, who he truly hoped would survive in the end, once fully rejoined with her shards."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Prithee, may I take’st a moment of thine time, Emet-Selch?” Hades turned, surprised to find the Astrologian standing in his doorway."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades glanced over a few of the book’s spines as he took a set from the bottom of his arms, “Thank you, for these.” Hades, in turn, took the tray of food and placed it atop his bed for later."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Again, I thank you,” Hades gave a slight bow of his head, his interest peaked by the odd language which littered the parchments before him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As he exited the doors of the Tower, the bustling noise of the courtyard greeted Hades with a cacophonous wash of sound."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades scowled up at the bright sun, making his way down the stairs at a slow, grumbling pace."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades rolled his shoulders and he set forth towards the markets, in search of the café he and the hero’s comrades had attended the few days prior."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Normally, Hades didn’t think he’d mind crossing her path, but their group was blocking the western-most entrance to the markets, the route he needed to take to the café."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Good morning, Emet.” The Champion’s eyes sparkled back at him, amusement and a smug curve of curiosity curling at her mouth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a huff, the Warrior of Light placed a hand on her hip, clearing her throat to draw his attention, “Ahem, Good morning, Emet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades snapped his gaze away, realization that he’d been caught staring dawning on him as he averted his focus to the stonework on his left, rather than the gaze of the woman in front of him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “’Tis quite rude to grab onto people, child.” Hades mumbled, prying his sleeve from the little girl’s hands."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As a few of the children began to chuckle, Hades arranged himself with more than a twinge of annoyance, now towering up to his full height."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Well, I want him to come!” Sy’nath stated, grabbing back hold of Hades’ sleeve."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’ face fell into a look of near horror as the children began to cheer, chanting and arguing over who would get to pick herbs with The Warrior of Darkness’ tall friend."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Yes, well,” Hades noted her expression and felt his cheeks warm, “The apology seems less meaningful when you snicker so, hero.” Hades began to smooth his clothes, eyeing the children in favor of looking the Champion in the eye, “…I will not be carrying one of those baskets.” “And here I was led to believe you toppled nations, empires, oh great Emet-Selch, pardon, Solus.” He resisted the urge to twitch at her mockery, “It’s interesting that you act as if children may be the end of you.” As the words left his mouth, realization dawned on Hades as to just what exactly he’d said, and in what way he’d implemented."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His arms laid crossed atop his chest, tightening as his gaze met Hades’."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch will be spending the afternoon with us in Lakeland,” Emilia called, waving her hand to him dismissively, “We’ll be gathering herbs for the kitchens if you need us.” The Warrior of Light began gesturing the children down the stairwell to the forests below, “He was, but when I asked for help watching the children, Emet so graciously volunteered his time,” The hero stated, shrugging, “The kids wanted him to come as well, far be it from me to deny them.” As Hades made to descend the stairwell, the Gunbreaker eyed the little hands gripping onto his jacket, a smirk spreading on his lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He’d conveniently left out the part where her soul had been nearly rent asunder, that her life still, even in slight repair from the warden’s and Emet-Selch, aired on the edge of death’s door."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In his defense, he didn’t feel it necessary information for the others to know, at least until those comrades on the First could determine whether or not Emet-Selch was to be trusted or not."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By now he didn’t think there was much the Ascian could do, withdrawn of his aether as he was, but until the other’s trusted him as well it’d be much harder to quell their anger and suspicion towards Emet upon the Source if he returned with them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watched on as she grinned up to the hero, showing off the crops she’d harvested from just this tree alone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had lost track of just how long they had been out harvesting these various acoutrama of foods, but even he could see their daylight was beginning to set behind the trees."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watched amusedly as the children filed to her order, lining up as they had upon their journey into the forest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The hero chuckled as she set the group of kids to walk on, falling behind to wait for Hades to catch up to her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades bristled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades swallowed, taking in the grey and white that colored the ends of her hair with a sudden catch of interest, “…How old are you, hero?” One of her gloved hands picked at the fabric of her coat-sleeve as she spoke, “I-I am well past my twenties thank you,” She murmured, then again with more strength, “I-I will say, I’m not sure what customs you had in Garlemald, Emet-Selch, but where I’m from, ‘tis rude to ask a woman her age.” Hades chuckled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For a fleeting moment, Hades was reminded of the manner in which Persephone, Azem, would pout at him—none too different from the hero’s current mannerisms, minus the additional limbs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I did not mean to offend you, hero,” Before he could stop himself, Hades lowered one of the bags from his shoulder and placed it on the ground."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The ears that’d been flat against her skull now rose high on her head, twitching, acting almost like bumpers on either side of his hand as he moved his fingers back and forth vigorously, “I…W-wait,” Her face was now colored back to that same, flustered red, “E-Emet!” Hades smirked and began to walk, looking back over his shoulder, “There’s many a thing you don’t know about me, hero, and I shall ever pride myself on that.” Also, if you guys are on the search for a wonderful, inclusive, and supportive Emet\/FFXIV fanfic community, I urge you to come by and join this discord!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades raised an eyebrow as he looked down at her, golden eyes taking her in."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked down at her, eyebrow raised again with an equal, confident smirk."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades paused, allowing her to stop him mid-stride, “Didn’t we just discuss how there’s ‘many a thing we don’t know’ about each other, Ascian?” “Hmm,” Hades chuckled, “I think not.” “Hmm, my mistake then, hero.” Hades nodded his head in mock respect, though the smirk was still present."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hmm, perhaps,” Hades pushed past her and began to walk again, shifting the sacks of herbs and veg back on his shoulders more comfortably."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades rounded, “You’ll what, hero?” As the group ascended the stairs, Hades could spot some of the Scions standing atop, cloaked and wrapped in their own winter-like clothing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades scoffed, “Compared to the shiny tower you keep me locked in?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watched as she tried to hide it, fail, then begin again with tears in the corners of her eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet?” Hades swallowed as the hero’s eyes met his, staring up at him with a modicum of concern and glee, “I-I’m fine.” He stated, now aware that he had stopped walking to stare at the woman."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What exactly are we doing with all of this?” Hades grumbled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades turned his gaze from the beasts and watched as the hero stepped forward, shaking the fellow’s hand with a pleasant, friendly smile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If she wasn’t friends with everyone in the Crystarium, he’d be surprised; they all seemed to hold her in high regard, Hades didn’t really understand why that particularly surprised him, despite her short time on the star, but it did nonetheless."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watched them for a few moments, amused by their yelling and giggling after one another."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Let me help you with those,” Hades looked down to see the hero stretching up at him, gesturing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades furrowed his brow, taking a step back and shaking off his thoughts, “Walk on, hero, I can manage.” She could only be around 5 foot 5 or so, and in his human form, Hades suspected he was somewhere around 6 foot 4—the comparison between the two had to be laughable."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A little more forcibly than he intended, Hades pulled back and hefted the bag above his shoulder, yanking it from her hands, “I’ll manage hero, continue on.” Zodiark help him he could feel her muscles, the bend and weight of her hips, her chest stretching against his stomach, his thighs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “No one said you were, Emet.” She rounded."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades forced a breath, “Gather yourself and lead on, I have it.” Emet-Selch matched her look, raising a brow, “Trust is part of cooperation, lead on.” She stormed back over to the man she’d spoken with before and gestured forcibly at Hades, glaring as the elder looked from she, to him, back to she, before he quickly stumbled towards the latter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a pointed smirk Hades looked to the hero, back to the man, to she again, then back; he couldn’t resist."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had to admit, he was beginning to wonder if this was a common thing she’d do when she was angry—he couldn’t remember the hero doing it as much before."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Out of the corner of his eye, Hades could see the Warrior of Light standing with her arms crossed, ears flattened angrily against the top of her head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watched after her with a confused look, wondering just what she’d done."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A few of the others, Hades noted, were sifting through the baskets they’d delivered, sorting the food into different piles and likewise sacks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ah, I…” Hades shrugged, standing back to his full height, “I simply did as the Warrior of Darkness asked, she’s the one deserving of your praise.” “Regardless,” The man reached forward and picked up a small bag from the table, reaching out and forcing it into Hades’ hands."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades lifted a brow and rattled the bag, the jingle of coin resounding from within."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As he made to bid the man farewell, a hand reached out and firmly grasped hold of Hades’ bicep, pulling him from beneath the tent into the fading light outside."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a firm jerk, Hades yanked his arm free and rounded, finding the Gunbreaker smirking up at him with the small, red-haired Oracle at his side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades frowned, that must have been some earpiece or something she’d used before—that explains it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Is that true, Emet?” Thancred noted her then shifted his gaze back up to the Ascian, “Emilia said that she expected you, therefore we all are.” When Hades made to interject, he held out a hand, “I won’t force you to come, whether or not you eat is up to you and frankly, I could care less, but she said to remind you of it.” Hades looked down at the child and she looked back, nodding enthusiastically between he and the Gunbreaker, “It’s my fault…I’ve been asking Emilia if you could come lately, she said that you’ve been busy and…I didn’t want to bother you while you were working,” She paused, “But no one should have to eat alone, and besides, it…would be nice to ask you some questions.” Ryne gasped excitedly, “However,” Hades paused, “My attendance depends on how much work I can finish with your Astrologian; I will not leave until we’ve made progress.” Hades couldn’t blame him, the theories they’d conjured up in response to their readings had struck up serious discussion regarding the Scions return to the Source."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades sighed, leaning back in his chair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was an interesting idea, though in order to do so, locking their mortal souls within something like auracite, Hades had to admit, he had no idea how they’d manage."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As he walked, Hades’ mind wandered past the thoughts of the auracite and back to the Warrior of Light, to the pouch still weighing down his satchel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As he reached the various landings, Hades could feel his cheeks beginning to warm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gods be damned, he’d pause his reading to rub at his eyes, then his mind would wander back to her blush, how bright her cheeks had turned, how good the color looked against her skin, how... Hades paused as he reached the doorway to the tower, rubbing fiercely at his face with his now leather clad hands."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades growled as he looked into his palms, biting back the words he wanted to yell at himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was the one who set her on her path originally, he was the one who nearly shred her soul from existence in favor of a God, a race of people, he still wanted to foolishly save."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Breathing deeply, Hades dropped his hands and moved on, steeling himself to keep away those thoughts, those…ideas."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could feel a small pit of anxiety settle in his stomach, “What are you doing here?” Hades’ brow furrowed, “Needed the walk?\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That gave Hades pause; he knew she had the sight, but surely not enough to see the colors his thoughts had turned his soul… At least, no, she was mortal, surely she couldn’t see that minute change, not in a soul as dense as his own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For a brief moment, Hades recounted that he had never been to the dining hall in person, all of his meals had been brought to him in his rooms thus far."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades didn’t feel he favored most of these, but he’d not seen enough of the current tower to know really."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades paused for the second time that evening, “Well,” He looked back to the crack in the door then sighed, his stomach felt like ash, “You’ve my attention.” Hades swallowed, “I’m not sure I follow.” For a moment, Hades felt doubly guilty for his earlier thoughts, “Let me just say, she was different before this star, before these people touched her, helped her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sighing, Hades reached out to the half-opened door, resolving himself to consider her words another time, when he was alone and less…influenced."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As he began to approach, Hades noted that the elezen twins, Exarch, and Gunbreaker still sat around the table, chatting amongst themselves until they noticed him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I said I’d come after my work was finished, and so here I am.” Hades shrugged and began looking over the remaining food, trying to decipher what exactly the spread was."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’ gaze fell upon bright red eyes, for the first time noticing that he’d taken the chair opposite he, to the other side of the Warrior of Light."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades frowned, “I can just gather my plate and leave, if my presen—” The short, elezen woman huffed and excused herself from the table, storming out the way Hades had just entered with no other word than what she gave prior."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watched as the male twin left as well, then opted to being filling his plate in the silence that followed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked up to her, watching as the hero pushed the remaining food around, particularly the tomatoes and balsamic."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had felt the little fruits tasted fine, perhaps a little too firm still, for his liking, but the balsamic glaze was pleasant enough to take away from that fact."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet had alleviated some of her curiosity through questioning, albeit, but she was no further in understanding why it was still happening, nor why Hydaelyn refused to answer her calls, than she was a sennnight ago."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet had kept dreadfully quiet regarding any question about why he brought her there in the end, or offered her succor be it the Light fully took to her soul, but she refused to press it any further now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hm,” Hades inclined his head, watching as Emilia pushed at them yet again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It rolled, well past the rim of her plate and over, stopping against the edge of Hades’ own with a gentle, wet “plop.” Her eyes widened, the blush present before now deepening on her cheeks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At this point, Hades felt he had two options, the latter of said two was one which he’d recalled acting through with Azem and a set of grapes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades lifted it, holding the small, round fruit up in line with the Warrior of Light’s bright, cerulean stare."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades chuckled, making sure to look her in the eye, before taking the tomato and plopping it into his mouth, whole."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades considered her for a moment, thinking on the petite roma he’d just swallowed; juicy, perhaps a little unripe, though it wasn’t unpleasant."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Is that what this is about?” Hades held back a laugh—she was actually mad at him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Since coming to that realization, and the other, Hades had made it a point to engage in some series of questioning, or storytelling, to excuse himself with she and the Oracle instead."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When he laid in bed, finding it hard to fall asleep, Hades would find himself wondering about what Emilia’s favorite color could be, and why."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades asked her about her dislikes too, though she seemed a little more forthcoming with those as opposed to her likes, as if she felt uncomfortable sharing the things she enjoyed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades did note that they would fog up when she would exert herself, or that they would sometimes slide down her nose, but he really did seem to enjoy the way they looked on her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When he was alone in his rooms, sometimes Hades would catch himself jotting down little notes from their conversations in the corners of his scrolls, or on scraps of old papers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the distance, though, Hades felt like the cloudy sky threatened the potential of rain."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades chuckled and folded himself down into a sitting position, sprawling out alongside the Oracle on the canvas blanket with a grunt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As she began to wipe at her face, Hades noted the hero had worn another full set of battle attire today."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As Emilia drank down her flask of water, Hades also noticed she wasn’t wearing anything particularly dark today as well; her top was off-white, billowy and far, far too big for her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Do you only work with swords, hero?” Hades gazed back at her blade with curiosity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watched as the Warrior of Light’s eyes dropped, roaming back to her cleaver with a look mixed somewhere between disgust and annoyance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She didn’t like the way he stressed the word, but then again, Emet had also been one from what she’d gathered of his abilities as an Ascian."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She and the girl were silent for a time, and yet again, Hades could see her glaring out at her blade in annoyance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watched as the hero placed an affectionate hand on the girl’s red hair, fluffing it slightly, before walking back out into the middle of the training field."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As the weapon, he could only assume that was what it was, began to fully materialize, Hades could make out its composition in more detail; oak staff, embellished and carved with silver brocades and, from what he could see, small, crystalline flowers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In that moment, Hades could see Azem rather than the hero standing before him, tall, beautiful and powerful."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was not much of a weapon per se, but in her hands, in her hands it very much could be, and here, Hades could see much of the same."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Stewardess to the Stars, Azem, whose purpose it was to release the weak, the broken, the near dying from the world of the living, their world, and usher them on into the Lifestream, thus…to him, to Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emilia straightened, putting the cane up beside her in much the same fashion, Hades noted, that Azem would."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could feel his breath returning to him, grounding him back to reality."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades yawned loudly, sprawling out on the cloth blanket with purpose."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watched the hero smile fondly at the girl before continuing, “I guess it would be best to compare it to something,” She paused, “You’ve seen Y’shtola’s magic, yes?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Now that he thought on it, Hades did recognize some of the elemental colors in her aetheric imbuement."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “This is why you can’t use it, then?” Hades interjected, more serious, “At least here?” “Emet is right,” Emilia’s face grew somewhat grim, but she nodded again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades nodded, “So how does other magic work, like Y’shtola’s, or Alisaie’s?” Ryne inquired, “Doesn’t their magic also do the same?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had just reached forward to partake in one of the basket’s sandwiches when he noticed the hero’s sentence suddenly fall off."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades and the Oracle now stood, understanding now apparent, “Should I go get Thancred?” The red-haired girl called, hands clasped anxiously at her chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades sprinted to the Warrior, hands reaching out and shaking at her shoulders."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Through the warbling and ringing in her ear, she could hear Emet’s voice yelling at her, trying to get a response, but her mouth wouldn’t move."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We're learning a little more in this chapter, more about Mr. Emet and a little more about Emilia's past...I hope you guys enjoy these things, I'm trying my best to flesh out the details as we go."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Vaguely she was aware of Emet’s hands clasping hold of her shoulders, shaking her slightly, saying her title."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a hard jolt, Emilia snapped from the ground, shoving the kind hands from her shoulders with a force Hades felt could nearly break his wrists."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could see that something had snapped in their hero, something that’d been holding their Champion together, soul and mind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As his breathing began to stabilize, Hades could see the silhouettes of the Scions approaching him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Vaguely he was aware that his mouth was moving, attempting to form words, “Emet-Selch, Emet are you alright?” Hades groaned as the pair on either side of him marched on, his chest aflame with white, hot agony."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “H…How do you know…” Hades grunted, trying his best to keep pace with the two carrying him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Con…venient g-gift.” Hades scoffed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades cried as she stepped into the glowing portal, a reverberation of glass ringing in both his ears and chest as she disappeared within its radiance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Urianger hooked his hand beneath Hades’ shoulder blade, pulling him back with the seer at his side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The cool, jagged crystal of the Ocular’s walls now pressed against his back, holding the brunt of Hades’ weight rather than Astrologian and miqo’te’s shoulders."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hath we not seen this before,” The elezen stated, bending down in front of Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades clenched at his chest, leaning his head back to breathe, “It’s…It’s her soul.” Hades’ heart grew cold, stomach turning acidic and vile—he was on the verge of blacking out, but consciousness or no, he could see no aether moving in the form she held."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades shuddered under that gaze though, unwilling to look at it after her initial meeting of his eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could only see the tether when it was about to break, because he needed to keep it from fully doing so."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades flinched, an immense well of agony and grief filling him where the connected pain could not, “Damn this war, the Source."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Child or no, even her best intentions wouldn’t reach the hero in her grief, even Hades could see that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I know that you’ve twisted my memories of the First, of him,” She jerked her head forcibly at Emet-Selch, “Of all of them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, still clutching at his chest, straightened under her gaze."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, for the first time, realized that he did not speak as if he was protecting his dearly departed beloved."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I left thee with the sight for a purpose…” The Oracle’s eyes fell on Hades’ sadly, pityingly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He… Hades felt tears welling in his eyes; surely Zodiark had not thralled him to do this, surely this was of his own consciousness, decision."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watched as the Oracle took hold of the hero’s hands, holding them in much the same fashion that he had sennight’s before."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As the light began to glow between them, Hades could feel a similar warmth settling in his own chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked down as well, noting that his own violet essence was shimmering, pulsing; deep within, he could see the stakes that chained together his aether diminishing, fading."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As the light in the room began to diminish, Hades could feel the last of the shackles round his soul fade in their entirety."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades flexed his arms, breathing deeply, he felt powerful and new, alive."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Reflecting upon his face, Hades realized for the first time that his glyph, his true, ancient glyph, had returned, glowing bright and crimson upon his face like a siren."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Despite this, Hades could feel his chest tighten happily—he could sense it, the strength that’d returned to her in turn, brightening her soul."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She would be okay, “I hath freed the bindings I’d placed upon this one,” Hades watched as the Oracle stopped before him, gesturing down for the others in the room."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades swallowed, a hard lump forming in the back of his throat, “And what did you show her?” Hades’ head jerked back up, brow furrowed in confusion."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades scowled, “Why is she returning to Amaurot then?” Emet-Selch stood on the other end of the long platform, laughing at the prospect of her failure—she could hear him ebbing her on, urging her to accept the light, to give up, give in."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Emet she had been spending time with, helping, or whom she felt she had been helping, did not seem the same as the one she’d journeyed with during her time on the First, at least prior."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Vauthry or no it didn’t change the fact that Emet did save Y’shtola, no matter their distaste, he did try to help them understand their fight, understand them, the Ascians."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He didn’t have anyone else besides Elidibus, perhaps, but even then Emet had been adamant since his rebirth to help in the Scions fight against him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet had made well to answer any inquiry she presented him with, honestly, she’d felt, and she’d tried to do the same with him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet was funny sometimes, either in his reaction to she and Ryne or just in his stories—she really had enjoyed those, perhaps the most."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She would not consider these things now, she still needed time to sort out these memories, especially if she meant to talk to Emet about them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What was Emet doing here, visiting with D’ve?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet looked back to her but didn’t hold her gaze for very long, looking instead to her shoulder, the door behind it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked down at the miqo’te woman, taking in the state of her hair, and face, with interest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades straightened, brushing the collar of his coat flat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He sighed, “Even if I wanted to, hero,” Hades looked back to the door, gesturing with his head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades turned back to the table, removing his coat frustratedly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Last Hades had heard she’d been called off to some squabble in Eulmore, acting on behalf of the Exarch to try to settle a matter regarding livestock prices, or something of that caliber."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades nodded, laying his coat and gloves atop the table in a folded bundle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades sauntered around the table, trying to gaze over her shoulder at what she was doing, “What drink?” Hades watched as she poured the steaming water into the cylinder, stirring it just as she’d explained before with a large, metal spoon."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades accepted the mug, nestling in his hands, smelling it; cream and no sugar, “Thank you.” Hades followed her gaze, looking back to the miqo’te that lay motionless on the bed—he looked just as he did before, peaceful, aside from the hair that lay rumpled around him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades started, then took it upon himself to step towards her, quietly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades walked on mutely and sat much the same, looking out as she did at the rainy, overcast view of the Crystarium that spread below them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades nodded, taking a sip from his own cup gingerly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades kept finding himself looking down at her despite the view, questioning what she was thinking, what she had been feeling, dreaming."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She scowled as Hades looked down at her, “Can I show you something?” Hades nodded—it was a commonly avoided inquiry, “I…this is so stupid…I, you know I don’t like to talk about it, I guess?” “If it makes you uncomfortable, hero, you need not worry,” Hades replied, quickly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As she turned over her arms, Hades could see that the worst of the burns laid on the back of her forearms, extending towards her bicep beneath the sleeves of her sweaters."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades felt himself extend his hand out towards her, reaching for the smaller hand that now sat limp closest to him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gingerly, delicately, Hades brushed the tips of his fingers atop her smaller hand and then round, taking her wrist between his long fingers like a man holding a rod of fragile, broken glass."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With his thumb, Hades began to slowly trace the outlines of the scars from her inner wrist, pausing to feel the way the skin felt against his own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades hesitated but nodded again—he had yet to see her fight hand-to-hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hmmm.” Hades didn’t find it as amusing as she."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades traced his hand over some of these scars, brushing against the edges with his fingertips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades nodded, watching her intently."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I…am sorry, hero,” Hades whispered, looking for her eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A sad smile pulled at the corners of her lips, “It’s fine, Emet, you don’t need to sympathize.” She cleared her throat, pushing her glasses back up on the bridge of her nose."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades felt his hand, the one that’d been laying limp at his side, reach forward before he could stop himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I saw your face, Emet, I know how they look.” The annoyed chill that he’d been trying to keep from his voice now edged through coldly, “They make me angry that your Mother allowed these to happen, despite your supposed blessing.” She made to open her mouth, to interrupt him, but he kept on, “They make me angry that you’ve seen, and been through, that much pain—that you feel that way about them.” Hades glared, “I can see it, you wouldn’t hide these scars if they meant nothing to you, hero, don’t lie.” Emilia chuckled again, shaking her head, “It’s fine, Emet.” She was deflecting him, “Had I thought they’d upset you this much I wouldn’t have shared them, really, it’s fine.” “Emet,” The hero’s hand had come up to grasp at the wrist near her neck, “It’s fine, really.” “You are far more than a series of scars, mistakes, if that is what you choose to deem them as.” Hades could feel himself fighting to pull her in, to take her against his chest and hold her, comfort her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades didn’t register what’d happened until her mouth was pressed against his own, softly, tentatively."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As her mouth opened, Hades dragged his tongue along her lips, a light coffee flavor, he realized, still lingering on them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If he moved away, if he breathed, Hades feared the moment would end, fragile and sweet though it was."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As she began to finally pull away, Hades could feel her breath hot on his face, his mixing in with her own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades reached out, trying to grasp back hold of her wrist, catch her gaze, but the hero pulled away, shaking her head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She’d been avoiding quite a lot lately, it seemed—Hydaelyn, D’ve, Emet, Scions…Not all entirely of her doing, Emilia had felt, but some, one, was."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Scions, Crystarium and Exarch, they would live, Emilia was here to make sure of that, and so…would Emet, now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades took in a breath, sighing as he looked down at the book in his hands."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades rolled his shoulders, stretching his limbs methodically, lazily."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a sigh, Hades settled his gaze sadly on the cup near his armrest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades glanced over the exposed spines near his armchair, searching within the pile he’d yet touched."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All this to say, Hades felt angry…and more than a touch annoyed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked back to his cup with a sneer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He never asked, but Hades suspected they were all still brought on demand of the Warrior of Light—as apathetic as she seemed towards him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Whom, by the way, Hades noticed seemed altogether too pleased that the vaunted Warrior of Light had been speaking to him less, and less…and less."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades took in a deep breath, remembering how soft, fragrant, her hair had felt wrapped in his hands."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades slammed the new book shut and hurled it across the room, its spine thudding limply into the dining table seated opposite he."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a raised eyebrow Hades looked over to the miqo’te Summoner, wondering if the noise had managed to stir him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades turned and walked on, grumbling as he made for the kitchenette."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He should wake soon, Hades considered, given the improvements he’d noticed in his aether and self."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Viera sisters, Runar, Ryne, Thancred, Urianger, and…Emet-Selch—they all sat looking at her, a question on their faces."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As the small Oracle stepped away from her, relieved, the hero caught sight of Emet-Selch’s golden eyes watching her, intent."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Uimet scoffed, “We found him asleep in the shade of a tree near the ruins.”Emet’s expression soured, “And I was comfortable, mind you.” The Viera gestured to the group, admonishing him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch gave the miqo’te a measured look at that, but she brushed it off—they were not, not…right now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After a time, Emet’s eyebrows lifted, “I’m an acquaintance now, I take it?”  “Oh, we wouldn’t want to make the Warrior of Darkness wait now, would we?” Emet jeered, then sighed once he saw the miqo’te’s stoic reaction."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This Emet…he felt different, felt…wrong, too."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s expression dulled, “Straight to business I see, very well, hero.” He gazed around, clicking his tongue thoughtfully."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Perhaps the newer Emet she’d grown to know was actually more akin to this one than she gave him credit for, he was just as annoying, sometimes—the memory made her cheeks feel warm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet grinned and snapped his fingers—an orb of light appeared, dancing about his palm gently."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet leaned closer, looming above her with a predatory smirk."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This place was demolished, wasn’t it, after her fight with Emet?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet said he didn’t have access to his powers anymore, deprived of Zodiark and resurrected by Hydaelyn—how was it still standing, then?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “NO!” The Warrior of Light shrieked as she fell to her knees, the ghost of her long, dark cleaver visible through the hole in Emet-Selch’s chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As she sat, trembling and breaking, Emet-Selch appeared before her, lowering his hood."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet’s smile widened despite the wound."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As Emet’s corporeal form began to fade, the backdrop of chimes suddenly broke through, wailing like sirens in her head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet hadn’t put on that show for her originally, nor did he try to get that close to her—embarrassment washed over the warrior."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And then there was Amaurot…” Emilia could hear Emet-Selch’s voice reverberating in her head, melancholy yet proud, “Never was a city more magnificent."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If she couldn’t remember Amaurot like this, before Emet and their battle, let alone in name, why in the hell did it hurt so much to see it now?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades dodged as another series of blankets was tossed from the bedside of the Summoner, pillows and sheets shortly following suit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The sound had nearly knocked the rest of the water from the vase on the table, given how hard Hades had jumped into it, but it’d also, thankfully, sent the guard and medics in after."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even Hades had been doubtful the Summoner would regain consciousness this quickly, if ever—he supposed Hydaelyn still had a little left in her after all, given the rate of recovery."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades pondered this—he was nearly certain he remembered Summoner with a white iris neath his scared lid, much like the Scion seer woman."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a grimace, Hades backed away from the platform and crossed his arms, sauntering to the kitchenette."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Also, if you guys are on the hunt for a wonderful, inclusive, and supportive Emet\/FFXIV fanfic community, I urge you to come by and join this discord!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch.” Hades knows not why he has been summoned, but here he stands in the anterior chamber of Zodiark’s makeshift palace."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Emissary smiles, but Hades knows that it doesn’t reach the eyes behind the mask."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Light glints off the hard metal at Hades’ fingertips as he waves his hands in his frustration."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Worry not, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" the shorter man asks, and Hades grimaces at the sudden bitterness in his mouth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades tightens his hands into fists but continues to walk."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He stops and turns to face Hades directly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades doesn't want to have this conversation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There's no way to tell, but all the same it's not the man that Hades had grown to trust."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Very well, Emet-Selch.\r\n\tYou, as head of the Convocation, well know that it is,\" Hades assents, crossing his arms in irritation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It turns Hades's blood to ice water."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That gives Hades pause, but his grip remains."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades feels his chest constrict."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lord Zodiark has a personal missive for you, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Emissary looks so smug and Hades wants to punch the expression off of his face, but the next words spoken fix him in place."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Zodiark  commands  me to…  Hades can't quite find the words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yes, Emet-Selch.\r\n\tIt's as if someone has stuffed cotton into Hades's ears given the way that all sound has gone muffled as he rushes for the Capitol's exit.\r\n\tHades gives chase.\r\n\tHades intentions may be seen as dubcon\/noncon depending on your viewpoint.\r\n\tBut even if she can hide from the Convocation, she knows that Hades will never stop looking.\r\n\tHades could find her anywhere she went, and without certain precautions he would have easily tracked her down by now.\r\n\tThere is another element that endangers Persephone -- her soulbond with Hades.\r\n\tWhen he broke the news that he had volunteered for the first sacrifice neither she nor Hades could be placated.\r\n\tBut while Hades finally hid himself behind the mask of Emet-Selch, to serve the people and do what was in their best interests, Persephone had walked away.\r\n\tShe can still hear Hades's desperate pleading as she turned her back on him.\r\n\tTears blur her vision before she's sheltered in place, but it's  Hades  .\r\n\tWith Hades it had been easy.\r\n\tIt's  Hades .\r\n\tHades has come for her at last, sending an excited shiver down her spine while her stomach seizes in terror.\r\n\tIf Hades gets too close she's going to lose, and it has nothing to do with him being one of the most powerful sorcerers that the Star has ever known.\r\n\tHades's voice is light on the wind, and it's hard to tell exactly where it's coming from.\r\n\tNot like any she's seen before, but that  scent  --it's undeniably  Hades  .\r\n\tHades stands before her, tall and slender and beautiful.\r\n\tThe white button down is surprisingly unstained by the greenery, prim and pressed as if it were a day in the office, but  unlike  at work the fabric hangs open to offer a mouth watering view of Hades's leanly muscled chest.\r\n\tHa--Hades…\" she croaks, finding her voice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yes, just like that, Hades coaxes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The low timbre of Hades's voice sends shivers along Persephone's spine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Let me take care of  all  of your needs,\" Hades speaks, his fingertips brushing over the light material of her sleeves."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Persephone snaps out of her daze and steps quickly backwards as vines crack at Hades's feet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Don't be upset, Hades's voice rings through the trees."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, I've missed you too… she admits, wavering."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ah ah, Hades corrects her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades can practically feel the heat radiating off of her skin as she wanders nearer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her fingertips brush against his, their fingers intertwining as Hades lures her closer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" H--Hades, we can't-- Hades's voice remains soft and reassuring, but the look in his eyes couldn't be more serious."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh Hades, she whimpers, clutching at her stomach."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It's just enough to bring back her clarity, but Hades… wherever he is, he's surely realized his mistake."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades will cut through it, but it  will  slow him down."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades cries."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If Hades has resorted to using his magic -- and she  knows  that he has -- then she has lost."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades is gifted with an uncanny sight for souls."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There's no doubt that the Hades she sees stumble into the clearing is the real one."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades runs his hands across his chest and up into his silvery hair, grabbing at fistfuls in his frustration as he falls to his knees."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This is for Hades too  , she tells herself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The thought does nothing to comfort her as she hears Hades's cries."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Persephone opens her eyes she finds that Hades is gone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If Hades should still be near-- With Persephone basically in heat and Tempered!Hades pursuing her I see how this moves into dubious consent or maybe non-con territory."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gentle wind stirs the trees above and unseen birds yet sing, but time itself has come to a standstill as Persephone is snared in Hades's embrace."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It has long since worn away after fleeing from Amaurot, but now that Hades is here Persephone means to douse herself in it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He would speak but Persephone is on him again, thrusting her tongue into Hades's mouth to silence him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You're more feral than usual this year, Hades hisses when he breaks for air."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You're not some  apex predator  , Hades.\r\n\tButtons scatter to places unknown as Persephone rips Hades's shirt open, giving her free access to the expanse of his chest.\r\n\tHades would have come for her straight away unless something had prevented him from doing so.\r\n\tYou were mine  first  , Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades pulls them over her head and tosses the garment aside, grabbing for the flimsy sheath dress underneath."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades is thankful that she's sparing him the humiliation of struggling out of the confining leather."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You want to breed me with this, Hades?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh,  Hades  .\r\n\tHades starts, but curses as his damned  pants  restrict him from getting too far.\r\n\tWith a snap Hades's lower garments fade to aether and he's immediately on her, but even in his hazy frame of mind he can't bring himself to throw her on the ground.\r\n\tSpring is for  mating  , Hades.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Persephone is already so  wet  with desire and it leaves Hades groaning in frustration, and she has the nerve to  giggle  about it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a snarl Hades crosses his long arms over her back and pulls her down against him, reveling in the press of her breasts against his chest as he captures her mouth to cease her wicked taunting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Come on, Hades, she murmurs against him, \"don't you want to be a daddy?\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades can do little but rumble his displeasure in a long, aggravated groan."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Why do I want…  Persephone changes her focus to his neck, sucking with intent to mark as Hades appears to struggle with something."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Zodiark may have endorsed his leave, but  damn it all  , Hades has wanted this for so long."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her muted whines as she adjusts to being filled after this absence cause Hades to involuntarily arch his back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Persephone moves above him, slowly at first, but then as a woman desperate to scratch a deep-seated itch, a need which Hades is all too glad to oblige.  \""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ahhn  …\" comes her breathy cries, her breasts swaying temptingly in Hades's face as she bounces on his hips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I want… Hades,  I want  -- Persephone's babbling is silenced as Hades snares her into a bruising kiss.  \""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Please  …\" she whimpers against him, \"need you to… Hades  please  …!\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The feeling of Hades coming beneath her and the flood of his warmth within are enough to bring Persephone to her own climax."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Eventually she collapses to rest against Hades's chest, the exhaustion of the chase and their reunion catching up to her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades wraps his arms around Persephone and holds her close, content to let her rest while remaining deep inside of her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She seems to have dozed off, so Hades whiles away the minutes by picking stray leaves from her hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades's eyes burn and grow wet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Pulling her dusty robes up around herself, Persephone fixes Hades with a sobering look as she asks, \"what happens now?\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If only things were different; if only the angel on Hades’ shoulder were still alive, he might have had the courage to make the right choice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch, Hades, knows all too well about such suffering."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Persephone is apprehensive as she studies Hades's face, unaware of how deep the wounds run behind those tired eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, however, is not ‘some other man’."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But his Lord is merciful; He has promised Hades this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Persephone’s transgressions are great, and Hades has prayed with his heart and soul that she might be spared."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades takes advantage of her distraction, and presses his lips to her forehead with so much tenderness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I'm fine, Hades.\r\n\t“You’re not well,” Hades worries.\r\n\tHades is here.\r\n\tShe tilts her head and finds Hades curled up beside her.\r\n\tHades, on the other hand, looks terribly exhausted.\r\n\tHades has prepared a nest for her.\r\n\tShe’s unaware that Hades has long been awake, nor that she’s playing right into his hands.\r\n\tAnd Hades plays along, merely pretends at waking with a soft sigh, a subtle fluttering of his lashes.\r\n\t“I love you, Hades.” It doesn’t belong and she wants to speak up, she wants to tell Hades but he’s moving above her, she still moves with him and it’s wonderful, he feels wonderful.\r\n\tHer Hades, her husband.\r\n\tHades-- She’ll be with Hades, and together they’ll-- And Hades… they’ll be a family.\r\n\t“Hades…” she cries weakly.\r\n\t“Emet-Selch,” she calls through a smile.\r\n\t“I suppose,” Hades agrees.\r\n\tHades retreats to his private office as quickly as he can.\r\n\tEmet-Selch had promised to do everything in his power to save the Star.\r\n\tConsider joining a friendly and enabling group at the Emet-Selch discord!\r\n\tOf course, this was her excuse as she amassed interest in Professor Emet Selch as time went on, and things like his tie became secondary thoughts to other things.\r\n\tShe was not quite sure of the enigma that was Professor Emet Selch.\r\n\t“  Emet,”  he pleaded, his tongue appearing briefly to lick his lower lip, “please.” What with Emet far in his late thirties and his student barely of age, she could’ve been his daughter for Hydaelyn’s sake.\r\n\tHis smirk widened and Emet stopped thumbing the textbook on the table.\r\n\tEmet had planted the ideas of indelicacy without even breathing a word of it.\r\n\t“Perhaps,” Emet started, watching her like a predator as she stuffed her book into her bag and closing it with an audible snap, “you’ll ask me to indulge you in my knowledge as I did yours.\r\n\tEmet smiled broadly at her, clearly glad that she asked the question in favor of taking up his offer.\r\n\tThe next time they had their encounter, Emet smirked and pressed his hand back against the spine of a book so that it slotted back into its place on the shelf.\r\n\tEmet watched her body sway slightly as she turned to the section of the shelf next to his, eyeing the titles until it neared the one still touching his fingers.\r\n\tEmet thought of her like a mouse - she certainly had the features of one.\r\n\tShe watched Emet’s lips turn upwards and widen into a grin, and Aletheia wondered if she should’ve resorted to her initial plan instead.\r\n\tHer red eyes glistened when she rattled off more names, watching Emet nod at each one.\r\n\tEmet smiled at her ruefully, conjuring up memories of his own lengthy history.\r\n\tEmet could’ve had her, surely, but he’d play this dangerous game of cat and mouse with his student a little longer.\r\n\tThe lighting was ethereal for one thing, but towering over it was Professor Emet-Selch.\r\n\tEmet wondered if she realized her arrival and acceptance of his invitation meant they were past the point of no return.\r\n\tShe blushed when she watched Emet pull the bench towards him, muscles rippling along his arm for a moment before leaving it.\r\n\tFor the briefest of moments, she forgot that he was Professor Emet-Selch, and she was his student.\r\n\tRegardless, nothing was too hyperbolized for Emet to draw conclusions of his own.\r\n\tEmet pulled his hand away after listening to the echo of the note, and sat right beside her.\r\n\tThere was a moment of quiet where Emet shuffled through all the music since the beginning of time to find the perfect solitary piece to play for her.\r\n\tEmet’s intentions clearly included bedding her.\r\n\tEmet did not leave his piece hanging off like hers, instead, he ended it with obvious improvisation.\r\n\tBut he had done it too many times before, and when he had finally found her, Emet swore to follow through with making her his again.\r\n\tIt was a parting gift from Emet after he had thoroughly claimed her lips in the concert hall.\r\n\tEmet’s gaze was dark and troubled, brows knitted as if deep in thought.\r\n\tEmet arrived two minutes late to class, and Aletheia hadn’t been skipping class  that  often enough to know that was unusual for him.\r\n\tEmet smirked to himself when he noticed she had been tapping her pen to some sort of unknown rhythm.\r\n\tThere was something so poetic about  Un Sospiro  , but Emet had played it for her that day in the concert hall and she couldn’t get the piece out of her head.\r\n\tShe pulled down her sweater over the length of her torso, nearly freezing and tripping over her feet when Professor Emet turned from the corner of the hallway.\r\n\tJust as Emet-Selch promised, he made his appearance to her the last day of classes for the week.\r\n\tShe took her time walking back to her dorm, agreeing to meet Emet an hour since he had posed his question.\r\n\tSomething told her that Emet would paint that all over her lips before the night was over.\r\n\tEmet showed up promptly outside of her dorm, parked discreetly between two students’ cars.\r\n\tShe covered her nervousness the entire drive by asking Emet questions that were mostly meaningless.\r\n\tHe bowed briefly to Emet as he graciously accepted the envelope.\r\n\tWaiters and waitresses that addressed Emet by name, and attended to his glass of wine to ensure that it was never empty.\r\n\tAs brazen as Emet was, he hadn’t pushed her to drink at the very least.\r\n\tEmet finally turned to ask her a question.\r\n\tShe saw Emet’s smile soften at her quiet laughter.\r\n\tThe check never came, and Emet quickly moved to her side of the table and offered her his hand.\r\n\tSave for the kisses in the concert hall and in the car, Emet had been thoroughly conservative with his affections.\r\n\tEmet indulged himself in one kiss when they entered the car.\r\n\tThe doors pressed closed with a thud and no squeaks, and Aletheia turned to look at Emet.\r\n\tWithin moments, Emet had made his way to the piano, sliding the bench out and sat right in the middle of it.\r\n\tShe quickly wiped away the rest that followed, though the streaks were obvious given Emet’s expression when he turned to look at her.\r\n\tEmet seemed pleased by this, mirroring her moan lowly while he sucked her skin.\r\n\tEmet reached for the collar of his shirt, revealing the reminder of the almost-faded love bite on his neck.\r\n\tIn his mind, Emet rolled the idea of teaching her how to please him as an example for herself, and then to the possibility of grooming her to his own liking.\r\n\tEmet tilted his head, brow raised in expectancy.\r\n\tHer body had betrayed her, rupturing in a series of small quakes while Emet relished in her afterglow.\r\n\tWhere Emet was once wordy and full of prose, he now neglected in his answers.\r\n\tAs she slept, Emet-Selch sighed.\r\n\tEmet sent her dreams of Amaurot - his soul weighing heavier the longer he waited to reveal who he was.\r\n\tEmet pulled her to him now, nowhere to escape.\r\n\tIn the swirls of his mind, Emet knew it was true.\r\n\tEmet behaved during the week.\r\n\tEmet Selch disappeared into the darkness until then.\r\n\tEmet hadn’t quite decided.\r\n\tEmet closed his eyes, wondering how long he could afford to sleep for.\r\n\tHades.\r\n\tHades.\r\n\tHades.\r\n\tHades had to be delicate.\r\n\tHe had to admit that with his beloved so close to waking from her slumber, Hades was growing eager and impatient.\r\n\tHades did not have the luxury to think about that.\r\n\tHades sighed.\r\n\tNo, the worst part was that Emet was missing from the lecture hall.\r\n\t“You certainly took your time,” Emet mused with a half-grin when she arrived, “I was half-obliged to come find you myself.” Emet leaned forward across the length of the table and took a bite out of the macaron in her hand, eyes never leaving hers.\r\n\tEmet changed the topic with ease.\r\n\tEmet leaned back in relief.\r\n\tAletheia wasn’t surprised that somehow, someway, Emet had plans to lead her through his itinerary.\r\n\tShe had plopped herself on one of the luxe lounges in the middle of the room while Emet greeted his frowning friend.\r\n\tIt was clear Emet was the one staging all of this, and he would be the last to help her.\r\n\tA very strange name, properly stranger than Emet Selch for sure.\r\n\tEmet seemingly agreed with the ensemble.\r\n\tThat much was obvious with the way Emet would ruefully reach for her in the back of the car and be met with fabric rather than skin.\r\n\tEmet proves his last words as much when he leads her inside their next stop.\r\n\tEmet was right, as he always seemed to be.\r\n\tLahabrea, a man with blonde tousled waves stared eagerly at the door until his eyes glanced in Emet’s direction.\r\n\tHe was quiet the entire time that he was styling her hair, grumbling something to Emet whenever he’d come closer.\r\n\tEven so, Aletheia found the exchange riveting and only when Lahabrea scoffed out of nowhere did she look away once more, earning a quiet laugh from Emet behind her.\r\n\t“Emet Selch,” Lahabrea grumbles, “She’s finished, but not before I have a word with you.” Emet seemed to open his mouth to say something, but whatever jumbled words came out were of some ancient tongue Aletheia couldn’t recognize.\r\n\tIt would have been an easy feat for Emet to sense her, and so she didn’t know why she tried to hide her presence.\r\n\tOne would  never forget,” Emet growls, “But prove to me that there is another with thirteen times rejoined that we might usher to our side.” Emet shrugs half-heartedly.\r\n\tEmet’s brief with his goodbyes to Lahabrea, the man grumbling even more so as they went to leave finally.\r\n\tWhen they reach the car again, Emet reaches for her.\r\n\tHis aura had changed, and Emet made it obvious that he had no intentions to smother her with the uncontrollable desires from before.\r\n\tLahabrea had styled her hair so carefully, waves tumbling down her back, and now she twisted all of it to the side of her neck to hide Emet’s mark.\r\n\tIt wasn’t that she didn’t  trust  Emet, but there was something utterly so suffocating about his presence that she couldn’t trust  herself  to be alone with him.\r\n\tIn the end, she relents, hoping time with Emet would make those thoughts come further into fruition or abate the doubts away.\r\n\tShe finds Emet with two flutes of champagne in between one hand, and he smirks widely when he realizes why she had been absent from his side.\r\n\t“That’s enough,” Emet says gruffly, “I don’t want you underestimating your capacity.” She’s obedient at first, but a couple strolls past the both of them, throwing glances to Emet in greetings, and she chances a few more gulps.\r\n\tEmet’s changed the topic, his hand brushing through the white in his hair briefly before pressing it along her back, and then up, tugging on the velvet for comfort it seemed.\r\n\tEmet was anxious, both in the way he seemed to grasp at her any chance he got, and with the way that he no longer paid any mind to familiar faces that walked by them.\r\n\tNot many seemed to notice that she was there, even with her arm tucked between Emet’s.\r\n\tEven as she traversed the empty halls with Emet, she felt as though a part of her didn’t belong at all.\r\n\tEmet eventually interrupted the silence.\r\n\t“Emet-“ Aletheia is quiet, and Emet gives her that moment of silence to breathe, ruminate, whatever she might need to make sense of it all.\r\n\tEmet appears to have little shame in the matter, as if he couldn’t care less that someone was approaching.\r\n\t“Elidibus, you’ve come to gander at the wonders of this world,” Emet greets ‘Elidibus’ with cold in his voice.\r\n\t“That I have, Emet Selch,” he rouses, “Although, I had expected you to come alone as you usually would.” He returns the greeting with a press of his lips to her knuckles, an action that garners daggers from Emet’s eyes, but Aletheia reflexively bobs her head at the gesture.\r\n\t“We will speak later, Emet Selch,” he muses softly, “I leave you and yours to enjoy the rest of Amaurot.” The man could barely resist it, and Emet knew he was to expect gratefulness for the push in the  right  direction.\r\n\t“We will, indeed,” Emet replies at the man’s back through gritted teeth.\r\n\tAletheia rolled the word around in her mind, and before she could even say it, or inquire further, Emet had himself pressed against her again.\r\n\tEmet grants Aletheia a moment before they depart.\r\n\t“Emet, I’m only using the restroom.\r\n\t“Elidibus, be a dear and  fuck  off,” Emet states, “I said it once nicely.” Emet groans, getting enough space from him to throw the empty glass at him.\r\n\t“So bold are we to do that in public?” Emet asks airily, “What of it Elidibus?\r\n\t“You say all this as if you had no intention to stop me after the first shard,” Emet shrugs, “And here we are, fourteen of them later and you aren’t poised to stop me yet.\r\n\tEmet Selch, how very unlike you.\r\n\t“Garleans,” Elidibus spits out the word, “Perhaps you’ve become more like them than you’ve let on, Emet-Selch.” Emet-Selch  grins widely with little to retort back.\r\n\t“And what?” Emet scoffs, “We’re not talking about mere centuries, fool.” Think of it, Emet-Selch.\r\n\tIn Elidibus’ mind, he knew better than to think that Emet might usher himself into a phase of acceptance and be sundered from existence, but that was before he saw Aletheia.\r\n\tIt’s obvious to him that Emet Selch had grown impatient, finding her within means when she’s the most vulnerable and impressionable.\r\n\tBut who was he to argue morals with Hades?\r\n\tHe faded into the darkness as Emet wished, hoping for the billionth time that his ultimate goal would be to rejoin everyone after proof of concept.\r\n\tIn the car, she decides to turn away from Emet, body outward towards the window as she watched the teal lights disappear from view.\r\n\tElidibus might have been on the mark about his impatience, but one would think Emet-Selch, the Architect, to be the  most  patient man around.\r\n\tEmet reached for her neck, thumb caressing the curve of her jaw for a moment before he leaned close to her ear.\r\n\tAletheia did not respond, allowing Emet to ruminate on the lasting words Elidibus left him.\r\n\tIt’s obvious now that she’s cross, and Emet leaves her be.\r\n\tHer eyes dart to watch Emet murmur a few words to the driver, and she quickly gathers herself to exit.\r\n\tEmet arrived at his answer.\r\n\tHe crashed and burned, and even if he did it alone, it made Emet crass and clearly heartbroken for centuries until the next shard revealed itself - and then the cycle continued.\r\n\tRegrettably, Emet was no longer the man he was in Amaurot.\r\n\tHe drives off without another word and Emet turns to look at her, searching for certainty.\r\n\tIt takes her a long moment to find the keyhole, a gesture that makes Emet cock a brow.\r\n\tShe doesn’t dare to turn back and look, but she can hear Emet closing and locking the door for her as if he lived here.\r\n\tAs if anticipating this, Emet had pushed her hands away and began to undo the ties for her.\r\n\tEmet lets his eyes wander over her figure, resting briefly on the unmarked skin, and then to the matching black lace around her hips.\r\n\t“You won’t?” Her voice is just as quiet, and Emet feels the ache in his core grow twofold at the mere innocence of her question.\r\n\tEmet’s gentle when he reaches for the hand clutching the towel around her body.\r\n\tEmet grasps the waves of her hair at the base of her neck and swiftly ties it with some hair tie he manifested out of nowhere.\r\n\tEmet was surely putting Solus’ body to use.\r\n\tThe Garlean emperor, first of his name, a member of the Convocation, Emet-Selch, the Architect, no less, was playing the role of the servant.\r\n\tThis went on for a moment, the water running quelled their independent thoughts and Emet felt both tranquil and at ease ruminating while moving from one limb to the next.\r\n\tIt took Emet little effort to kiss her back, his teeth biting gently into her bottom lip to open up for him.\r\n\t“Might we consider what Emet-Selch is capable of that we are not?\r\n\tBefore there was even time for Aletheia to protest, Emet had his iron grip spreading her thighs apart and his fingers prodding her clit in circles.\r\n\t“Please,” she murmurs on his lips, “Emet.” Be specific,” Emet grins, lips near her ear now, “Tell me what more do you want?\r\n\tAs if sensing this, Emet curls his fingers into her, clutching her close to his shoulder as she climaxes.\r\n\tEmet can’t help but laugh inwardly at how indignant she’s suddenly become, her cheeks flushed red and her body closed off from his neglect.\r\n\tShe throws herself upon him, pressing Emet to the edge of her bed before pressing her naked form to him.\r\n\tEmet knew better than to groan at the sensation, but he was no liar.\r\n\tShe dragged the flat of her tongue down the fabric of his pants, and Emet was ecstatic.\r\n\tEmet allowed himself to close his eyes for the briefest moment, lulling in the sensation of her tongue around him, albeit inexperienced as she were.\r\n\tEmet wasn’t one to stutter, but she swore there was a quiver in his throat when she descended once more.\r\n\t“Emet,” she begged softly, knowing not what to ask, only wanting to say his name for good measure, and she dropped to the base once more.\r\n\tHer lips trembled briefly while she leveled her breathing, but Emet could sense a form of galvanization in her gaze.\r\n\tJust like that, the bubble of their intimacy popped, and he was no longer Hades with his sundered shard of Persephone.\r\n\tHe was Professor Emet Selch, and she was Aletheia, one of his hundreds of students who bore a reflection of his beloved.\r\n\tWhen she came to, she realized Emet had fulfilled his promise to her and stayed the night, allowing her full reign to hold him as she so sorely craved.\r\n\tAletheia knew better than to ask, and in her limited worldliness there was solace in cutting her losses and taking what Emet doing in her bed with her would consequently mean.\r\n\tShe wanted this to go on, and she wanted Emet to admit to the same.\r\n\tEmet returned in little time, his clothing from the night before either on his body or tucked neatly under his arm.\r\n\tBefore she could shut him out one last time, Emet pulled a manuscript through the rift.\r\n\t“Emet-“  With a wave of his hand, Emet retreats outside and disappears into the dark vehicle parked along the side of her apartment.\r\n\tEmet’s hands.\r\n\tEmet glanced up from the papers briefly, gold brushing against ebony.\r\n\t“Another Ascian might join our ranks, and it stays just your business, Emet-Selch?” Even as they stared at one another, Elidibus in gripes with what Emet might have been insinuating, time would not yield.\r\n\tWhether or not Elidibus’ words conjured worry or concern, Emet was displeased by the encounter all the same.\r\n\tEven prior to this, as the emperor, as a legatus, as a sorcerer, Emet knew well enough that dispelling an ounce of the truth to anyone was a heavy price to pay in the certain future.\r\n\tEmet watched Aletheia in unabashed fashion, noting that she was struggling as she flipped between the third and fourth page.\r\n\tEmet took his time, standing up in a labored way, he sauntered over to where she had initiated a step onto the stairs out of the hall.\r\n\tAletheia nearly stumbled, knowing for certain something she could not put words to had happened in the fraction of a second she had begun to walk away from Emet Selch.\r\n\tThere was no doubt that if it had, Emet had a hand in it.\r\n\tAs if anticipating this thought, Emet had turned around the corner and made himself known.\r\n\tThe door to his office was unlocked, or so it seemed, and with a twist and shove, Emet had opened it.\r\n\tEmet took his time, circling around her once before propping himself at the edge of his desk.\r\n\tEmet Selch was bound to be the most seductive man in this plane, she cursed inwardly, it’s always only a matter of time before surrender.\r\n\t“Enough, Emet Selch,” she struggled to bolster any concept of seriousness, and the utilization of his full name only brought on more of the seductive smolder in his face.\r\n\tEmet Selch was bound to be some onze of ridiculousness mixed with… something entirely else.\r\n\tAs much as he was seductive, Emet could be persuasive when he wanted to be - or unintentionally.\r\n\tThe lights were already set, and the piano had been tuned and angled the way Emet Selch liked.\r\n\tWith so little preparation, and Emet gone to finish warming up, she had nothing better to do than prepare for the rush of the crowd.\r\n\tShouldn’t she have felt some blossoming pride at the thought that Emet had asked for  her  and no one else?\r\n\tBefore she could protest or complain, Emet kissed her.\r\n\tThe announcement came from the chancellor, bellowing his excitement for the esteemed Emet Selch that would soon grace the halls of the concert.\r\n\tSomething only Emet Selch was capable of.\r\n\tHer mind buzzed, her heart raced, and it happened twofold when Emet Selch came near her for more than a damned second.\r\n\tShe motioned at her, asking when she was planning to go on stage with Emet.\r\n\tEmet finished his rounds of bows before taking his spot on the bench.\r\n\tAs the girl had said, a spot where two heavy manuscripts sat had been placed carefully next to Emet’s left.\r\n\tIn its wake, her eyes drifted to Emet and he took the briefest moment to glance in return, assuring her that everything would be just fine.\r\n\tThe climax of the piece came and went, Emet pulling much of the weight as the main part of the duet.\r\n\tThe song Emet had pulled from nowhere, written out of nowhere, the song he wrote for her came to an end.\r\n\tEmet caught her by surprise, holding her hand up to his lips and placing a gentle kiss to it for one last bow.\r\n\tAt some point, Emet had disappeared behind the curtains, and the lights began to dim on the stage and light up the crowds.\r\n\tIt would probably do better than the usual rabble, Emet-Selch groused to himself.\r\n\tAnd while Emet-Selch certainly had his own plans, plans he was certain would succeed, watching all of the careful work put into place over centuries be overturned by a rag-tag group of Hydaelyn’s chosen was dampening his holiday spirit.\r\n\tEmet-Selch snarked to himself.\r\n\tIt was a low tone Emet-Selch hadn’t heard before, one that set him on edge.\r\n\tImpulsiveness overtook Emet-Selch in a wild rash.\r\n\tEmet-Selch unfolded his long body from his chair, moving in slow, languid movements to stand before the Warrior’s table, bowing low towards her.\r\n\tHe turned towards Emet-Selch, struggling with himself for a moment, before inclining his head with stiff politeness and turning awayy towards Captain Lyna.\r\n\tEmet-Selch lifted the vacant chair before setting it besides Kotori’s.\r\n\tNothing else to do, since you haven’t started hunting the next Warden,” Emet-Selch sulked.\r\n\t“We’re back to Ascian now, are we?” Emet-Selch purred, leaning close to her, letting his breath ghost across the flushed shell of her ear.\r\n\tFrom the corner of the eye Emet-Selch could see the Exarch warily watching them from a distance, a distinctive protective grit to the man.\r\n\t“Well,” Emet-Selch drawled, deftly picking up her abandoned drink and taking a sip of it—too sweet, the spices applied with a fumbling hand; he set it down.\r\n\tEmet-Selch’s grinned widened at her as she glared at him.\r\n\t“Perhaps that is true—but would he be as interesting of company?” Emet-Selch countered.\r\n\t“Cold still?” Emet-Selch frowned.\r\n\t“You would think human bodies would regulate temperature better,” Emet-Selch snarked.\r\n\tEmet-Selch scoffed.\r\n\tEmet-Selch gave a glance at the timepiece on the wall.\r\n\t“Shall we decide another way?” Emet-Selch presented a deck of cards with one deft movement, laying the stack in her hands.\r\n\tEmet-Selch enough.\r\n\t“Has anyone ever told you the best way to stay warm, hero?” Emet-Selch drawled as he hooked two fingers into her skin-tight leggings before pulling her smalls and all down to her knees.\r\n\tHe caressed the heavy swells of her breasts, her nipples hardening against his palm before bending down to pull one into his mouth, laving the swollen hardness, feeling her body contort and squirm beneath him, “Emet—“ she gasped.\r\n\t“Hades,” he breathed against her.\r\n\t“Hades,” she repeated, dazed.\r\n\t“Hades.” “Hades!” she begged, “I want— I want you—“ Hades moved her, admiring how she was so pliant and willing in his arms, turning her on her side, settling behind her.\r\n\t“Hades,” she whimpered, canting her head up to his.\r\n\tI'm really anxious to post this chapter because I worry that people will hate the way I present Emet-Selch's PoV but, here we are.\r\n\t“I was wondering how long you would sit there brooding, Hades.”  “I could ask you the same question, Hades.\r\n\t“After the fight with Emet-Selch,” she started, finally, leaning her head on my shoulder.\r\n\tThat definitely didn’t sound like the Emet-Selch I knew.\r\n\tEmet-Selch- no, Hades, himself- a champion of Zodiark, allowed in the Lifestream?\r\n\tEmet-Selch in the Lifestream?\r\n\t“I know you recreated Amaurot on that shard, Hades.\r\n\t“She was not whole, Hades.\r\n\tStay tuned for the next Emet-Selch chapter on Wednesday :3 It had been nearly two weeks since Ryne had told me about her dreams of Emet-Selch and the deal he made with Hydaelyn.\r\n\t“Emet-Selch.\r\n\t“Apologies for the interruption, Emet-Selch.\r\n\t“Hades, I can tell that something’s on your mind.\r\n\tHades, wake up.\r\n\t“Hades, this isn’t normal.\r\n\t“Hades…!” I could hear Hythlodaeus’ panicked tone as he called my name, but it slowly faded away, replaced with the soothing voice beckoning me to sleep, to dream of the past, to relive my memories of happier, less complicated times.\r\n\t“Hades, this isn’t normal…What...looking for?” Was he somehow with Emet-Selch?\r\n\t“Hades!” “When Hades created this ghost of a city, he made me the only one self-aware.” He looked towards a couple of shades standing in a corner, debating the end-of-times and the morality of summoning a God.\r\n\t“I dreamt that...that Emet-Selch was being judged for his deeds and that...that Hydaelyn would let him into the Lifestream under one condition- I know not what that condition was.\r\n\t“Could it possibly be the answer to why Hades is currently caught in a never-ending cycle of sleep?” Having a lot of fun with these Emet-Selch chapters in his memories of Amarout :D - Crystal During my quest to save the First, I witnessed an Ascian do it with a snap of his fingers.” I mimicked Emet-Selch and snapped.\r\n\t“Emet-Selch.” Emet-Selch sat on a bench a few yalms away, watching me intently.\r\n\tOver the coming days, Ryne joined me as I attempted to do what Emet-Selch had instructed me.\r\n\tIn my time using Creation magic in the real world, I found snapping my fingers did not work for me as it did Emet-Selch.\r\n\tEmet-Selch’s words made my stomach flip.\r\n\tFor a while now, I found their design underwhelming, preferring those I used while I was dreaming with Emet-Selch.\r\n\t“Emet-Selch was absolutely nothing short of amazing.” “Did this belong to Emet-Selch?” Ryne interjected, looking me in the eyes.\r\n\tIf this truly belonged to Emet-Selch, as thou sayest, I shall keep it in mine own possession so that I may study it more.” Emet's new snazzy outfit inspired by art by @AJenifha on Twitter!\r\n\tShe was sitting on the bed with Emet-Selch.\r\n\tI heard Ryne gasp and the wooden cup in Emet-Selch’s hand clatter to the floor.\r\n\tEmet-Selch looked over from his seat next to me.\r\n\tEmet-Selch reached his hand out after she’d put the tray down on the table.\r\n\tI was still curled up in the same position I had fallen asleep in, Emet-Selch still holding me, though it seemed, as he slumbered, his grip had loosened.\r\n\t“Have a good sleep, hero?” Emet-Selch asked, his voice hushed, as to not wake our young companion.\r\n\tSo glad some of you enjoyed Teacher!Emet as much as I did to write him.\r\n\tI turned my back on Emet-Selch as he continued to talk to Ryne about the contents of his book.\r\n\tA while later, as I was instructing Ryne on proper footing for her movements, I felt the bond between Emet-Selch and I fall silent.\r\n\tRyne had informed me, with a pout, that Emet-Selch had made her do part of her evening drills, but admitted they had not finished.\r\n\tI looked over my shoulder, Emet-Selch’s form moving towards us from the shade of the tree he’d been napping under earlier that day.\r\n\tWhen Emet-Selch walked out of the darkness, Runar’s scouts were immediately on high alert, quickly knocking arrows into their bows.\r\n\tEmet-Selch crossed his arms over his chest, waiting.\r\n\tMy eyes narrowed in on Emet-Selch first, my mind telling him to back down.\r\n\tHe tossed a glare in Emet-Selch’s direction, but started leading us back to his camp without a comment.\r\n\tWhen we sat down around the large table in her rooms, she eyed Emet-Selch for a moment before taking her own seat.\r\n\t“And you,” Y’shtola started again, looking towards Emet-Selch once more.\r\n\t“Emet-Selch?\r\n\tMy backside was still flush against Emet-Selch’s body, his arm still wound tightly around my waist, hugging me to him.\r\n\tEmet-Selch looked back down to me, taking in my barely-clad body for a moment, amusement in his eyes.\r\n\t“Emet-Selch, are you in there?” He knocked--pounded, really--on the door.\r\n\tIn a fluid motion, he had picked up one of my shurikens and thrown it at Emet-Selch, who moved quickly to avoid it, but he was not fast enough.\r\n\tWithout missing a beat, Emet-Selch dropped into a fighting stance, pulling his hands into fists.\r\n\tEmet-Selch moved to the side, playing the defensive.\r\n\tEmet-Selch’s eyes met mine for a single moment and he smirked, knowingly, before grabbing ahold of the Scion’s wrist as he charged and twisted his arm back.\r\n\tEmet-Selch released him, dropping the knife back on to the table.\r\n\tI opened my mouth to say...I didn’t know what, exactly, but Ryne rushed forward towards Emet-Selch to examine his shoulder.\r\n\t“Emet-Selch, you’re going to let me heal you!” I blinked, looking at the girl.\r\n\tEmet-Selch groaned and I sucked in a sharp breath as he fell to one knee, head in his hands.\r\n\tStep away from Emet-Selch.” I snapped my gaze to hers and raised a brow.\r\n\t“Emet-Selch, I swear if you don’t make sure she stops before she hurts herself…” she trailed off.\r\n\tAbout the only thing he hadn’t done at this point was spit in Emet-Selch’s face, and I wasn’t sure he still wouldn’t.\r\n\tRyne hesitated, looking over at Emet-Selch.\r\n\tWithout another word, Emet-Selch spun on his heels, heading for the room he’d abandoned the night before in favor of my bed.\r\n\tIn the meantime, I assume you have no need for me to tell you what must be done, Emet-Selch,” he turned to the portal that he created, walking into it and looking over his shoulder before he disappeared.\r\n\t“You wanted honesty, Emet-Selch.\r\n\tEmet-Selch lifted his head.\r\n\tEmet-Selch indulged me, but I could feel that he didn’t like it.\r\n\t“That vision that Emet-Selch and I shared…,” she started after a few long seconds of silence between us.\r\n\tEmet-Selch is there.\r\n\tAs I waited for Emet-Selch to come back from breakfast, I set myself in the bathtub in the adjoining bathing room.\r\n\tA while later, I stood across an open field from Emet-Selch and Ryne as he taught her how to channel her aether.\r\n\t“You always were the straight-forward one.” I watched Ryne make an attempt at whatever Emet-Selch was teaching her.\r\n\tLater that night, at Emet-Selch’s behest, I joined the Scions for dinner.\r\n\tI…” I looked at Emet-Selch, who nodded.\r\n\tEmet-Selch put a hand to his chin in thought.\r\n\tHow can you not see-” Emet-Selch stood quickly from his chair, his body language imposing and threatening.\r\n\t“You’re lucky this is a mutually beneficial relationship, Emet-Selch,” she quipped and I chuckled.\r\n\tWhen Emet-Selch broke the bind on my powers, it was like taking a breath of fresh air.\r\n\t“Oh come now, hero,” Emet-Selch taunted.\r\n\tEmet-Selch left me alone for the rest of the evening, more than likely knowing through our bond that I didn’t want to see him.\r\n\t“She isn’t Persephone, Emet-Selch.\r\n\t“How  long  have you known about this monster attacking the other city, Hades?” “Emet-S-” I saw Thancred bristle when he saw Emet-Selch’s hand wrapped around mine, even after we’d materialized, but he didn’t say anything.\r\n\tEmet-Selch stiffened next to me and G’raha Tia’s smile faded.\r\n\tWe thought it prudent to err on the side of caution.” Emet-Selch scoffed.\r\n\tI am Emet-Selch.” He knelt down in front of her, his words soft.\r\n\t“Well, an abundance of Light sounds absolutely dreadful to me, at the very least.” Gaia laughed softly at his remark, the sound almost melodious, and Emet-Selch smiled warmly at her.\r\n\tEmet-Selch blinked and looked back at us as if he had just remembered we were there.\r\n\tWas Hydaelyn telling me to be wary of Emet-Selch?\r\n\t“I had a feeling I would see you again soon, Emet-Selch.”  “I would recommend unbinding the guard and leaving, Emet-Selch,” she said suddenly.\r\n\tLater that day, I was sitting in my bed, trying to concentrate on a book I’d swiped from the Cabinet of Curiosity- trying to keep my mind off of Emet-Selch.\r\n\tI wanted to trust Emet-Selch.\r\n\tWhen I arrived, exhausted, depressed, and still in yesterday’s clothes, almost everyone else was there already, but Emet-Selch came in behind me.\r\n\t“Emet-Selch,” she greeted him.\r\n\t“If you think that, girl, you’re blind,” Emet-Selch shot back at her, then looked at Gaia, who had opened her mouth to respond, once again.\r\n\tZodiark is greedy and will just demand more and more and it will never be enough, Hades.” He narrowed his eyes towards me, but the moment I said his name- his true name- he dropped to a knee, groaning in pain.\r\n\tEmet-Selch stood again before I could finish admonishing my friend, the pain apparently subsided.\r\n\t“Please, Hades.\r\n\tEmet-Selch,  please  .\r\n\t“If I may interject, Emet-Selch.” The astrologian took a step forward and the hero turned to look at him with slight surprise on her expression.\r\n\tThe Warrior of Light looked back at me then, taking a deep breath before she continued, “Do you have any idea how hurt she was, realizing that you lied to her, Hades?” The past doesn’t matter anymore, Hades.\r\n\t“It doesn’t have to be a prison, Hades.\r\n\tI want to work with you, Hades.\r\n\tHades approached me, slowly, cautiously, unsure of how the Scions would react to him coming close.\r\n\tI looked back at Hades for a moment, smiling softly.\r\n\tHades shook his head.\r\n\tShe looked towards Hades.\r\n\tHades waved his hand, ordering my friends to head for the entrance.\r\n\tALSO, next week is my exam week (where I have 7 exams in a week ending with a 4-hour one on Friday), so the Emet-Selch\/Hades chapters may have a more sporadic schedule throughout the day but I will try my best to post them!\r\n\t“You really ought to learn to control your temper, Emet-Selch,” she mused, arching a brow.\r\n\tMaybe now I won’t have to suffer the company of a brooding Emet-Selch.” “So the reason you sought Emet-Selch is that he’s no longer tempered?” “Consider what Elidibus said confirmed, Emet-Selch.\r\n\t“Kiss me, Hades,” she whispered after a moment, prompting a shiver to run through my body at her use of my name.\r\n\t“Why did you start calling me Hades?” “In any case, I think I prefer to hear Hades coming out of your lips rather than Emet-Selch.\r\n\tI felt Hades start waking before I heard him move, my absence in his arms noticed.\r\n\tHades lifted and eyebrow.\r\n\tHades reached into the tub for the towel and wrung it over my head, an arrogant smirk on his face.\r\n\t“At once, Emet-Selch,” the voice on the other side replied as I released the button.\r\n\t“Your guests are outside the door, Emet-Selch,” the attendant said.\r\n\t“Is there anything else you need, Emet-Selch?\r\n\t“And if there’s anything historians make sure to hand down, it’s tales of legendary powers, and as far as mages go there are few greater than Hades and his masterful command over the power of the Underworld.\r\n\t“I know the history at the very least, to understand what having the title of Emet-Selch entails.\r\n\t“I believe we came here for a breakfast invitation from Emet-Selch and Halmarut, esteemed members of the Convocation of Fourteen,” she said, heading towards the table.\r\n\t“It’s quite good, Emet-Selch,” he said with a slight hesitation, the surprise in his tone matching his expression.\r\n\tHades locked eyes with me, and tilted his head when he saw my face.\r\n\tHades rushed towards Persephone, a wide grin on his mouth.\r\n\tPersephone and Hades were yelling at each other.\r\n\t“Hades, there must be another way.\r\n\t“Please, Hades.” Persephone was crying now, begging.\r\n\t“Emet-Selch wanted to find another way from the very beginning.” Yet another memory appeared in front of us.\r\n\tHades was watching her closely.\r\n\t“You’re the reason we’re in the mess, Emet-Selch,” he whispered, harshly.\r\n\t“Do you want to see the fall of Amaurot on your watch?” Hades clenched his jaw, hand begrudgingly rising from his lap.\r\n\t“I am sorry, friends,” she said, nodding sadly, then locked eyes with Hades.\r\n\tHades stood alone in his apartment, despair on his face and any trace of Persephone gone from what had once been their home.\r\n\t“Emet-Selch may not always make the best decisions.” The projection in front of us faded once again.\r\n\tEmet-Selch came to me, seeking another way.\r\n\tWhen our meeting had ended, most of us in a better mood, I reached out to Hades through the tether.\r\n\t“Technically, Emet-Selch would be closer to a Warrior of  Darkness  ,” she muttered and I scoffed.\r\n\t‘You don’t know how to hold your tongue, Hades.’ Back to your drills then, hero, you’ve had your fun teasing me.”  “Hades,  please,  ” she whimpered as she moved her hips roughly against my own, the force of her movement causing me to exhale sharply against her skin, the exasperation clear in her mind and voice.\r\n\tHades stopped immediately at the noise, the anticipation that had been building inside me leaving instantly, frustration taking its place.\r\n\tI locked eyes with Hades as he straightened.\r\n\tHades looked over at them for a moment, lifting an eyebrow, before sighing, irritation flitting down the bond.\r\n\tHades moved to follow me, but paused when he reached the two men.\r\n\t“Y-yes, sir.” Hades nodded and clapped him on the shoulder.\r\n\tHades was already asleep, curled up on his side.\r\n\tI opened my eyes, sleep still blurring my vision, but I could see Hades still fast asleep next to me.\r\n\tInstantly alert, I went to reach back for Hades, but the other man moved in an instant, next to me in the blink of an eye, leaning over me to gently take hold of my wrist in his clawed glove.\r\n\tI implored Hades to wait, to help me find another solution, but he refused.” He sighed, looking down at his lap, a sad smile spreading across is lips as I continued.\r\n\tI looked back at Hades again to make sure he was still asleep, not wanting to disturb his rest with this matter just yet, then slipped out of bed, heading for my small desk, the book Elidibus had brought in my arms.\r\n\tI warned Hades that this would happen and he refused to listen.\r\n\tHades shifted in the bed behind me.\r\n\t“Then perhaps you  should  read it, Emet-Selch.\r\n\t“It honestly sounds like you’re not ready to face the reality of what transpired between the two of you, Emet-Selch.\r\n\tI wonder if perhaps I should tell Hades what I know.\r\n\tCronus believes that Hades is not the man he once was.\r\n\tAfter Hades had disappeared in a cloud of purple smoke, I tried to keep myself occupied.\r\n\t“You won’t attack me unless I attack you first, so I’m going to sit here and ignore you until either Hades returns to deal with you, or you give up and leave me alone.” When I looked down, I was wearing the same robe I had the day Hades unlocked my powers.\r\n\tBut the more I thought, the more I realized  everything  he said was true, even about Hades loving me.\r\n\tI wasn’t sure how long we sat in that miserable, hateful silence before Hades finally appeared on a platform across from me.\r\n\tHades took a step forward on his platform and disappeared, then suddenly was looming over me, placing himself between me and his comrade.\r\n\t“Curious enough, isn’t it, Emet-Selch, how your Warrior now sits in Altima’s place, instead of Halmarut’s?” The crystal glowed at his command, a stream of purple light flowing towards Hades.\r\n\tHades turned towards me again, his eyes glowing with that same dark light.\r\n\tHades knelt in front of me again on one knee, a smirk on his lips.\r\n\t“Hades, please-” He scoffed.\r\n\t“I must say I’m relieved that things have turned out this way, Emet-Selch.\r\n\tPlease, Emet-Selch.\r\n\t“The issue here, Emet-Selch, is thou didst not make thy true intentions clear to her.\r\n\tI looked around the table to catch my friends’ reactions as Hades, yet again, apologized to them.\r\n\t“I took Emet-Selch some food while he was reading Persephone’s book.\r\n\tAs I talked, Hades held his ungloved hand out on the table, palm up.\r\n\t“He was using me as bait to lure Emet-Selch there, to be tempered once again.\r\n\tI felt Hades shift uncomfortably next to me.\r\n\t“Elidibus seemed to believe Emet-Selch had been tempered.\r\n\t“If I may, Emet-Selch,” Urianger said, and Hades looked across the table at him with a raised brow.\r\n\t“Yes,” Hades bit out, frowning deeply.\r\n\tFinally, Hades cleared with throat again.\r\n\tI went to stand, but Hades knelt in front of me, taking my hands in his, the claws on his remaining glove lightly scratching me.\r\n\tHe…” Hades furrowed his brow.\r\n\tBut, I want to share  everything  with you, Hades.\r\n\tI know that the word pales in comparison, Hades, but, truly, I  love  y-.” “I may not have all the explanations for Her actions, Hades, but She has been known to intervene if things aren’t going Her way.” Emet-Selch is here as well, likely for the same reason.”  “It’s time to get up, my beloved,” Hades said, softly, trying to coax me out of bed.\r\n\tHades stood at the side of the bed, his arm up.\r\n\tGaia looked up from her plate as we entered and nodded towards Hades.\r\n\tAs my conflict warred inside of me, the conversation around me continued, though Hades tried to send me assurances over the bond.\r\n\tWith his announcement made, Hades sat in the chair behind him.\r\n\t“That remains to be seen,” Hades answered, though he looked rather unhappy about it.\r\n\t“Ryne,” Hades said with a sigh.\r\n\t“Ryne,” Hades said again, louder, trying to command the room again.\r\n\t“Everything Emet-Selch has said is the truth.” “Emet-Selch, stand.\r\n\tWarrior of Light as well.” Hades scoffed, but did as she ordered.\r\n\t“Care to enlighten the rest of us?” Hades asked, crossing his arms in front of him.\r\n\tFeeling my uncertainty about everything learned and shared this morning, Hades implored me to look at him through the bond.\r\n\t“Emet-Selch has the Blessing of Light now?\r\n\t“Aside from the whispering, you seemed to function just fine while tempered before, Emet-Selch,” the male twin said with a shrug.\r\n\t“How is it that you travel from shard to shard, Emet-Selch?” the male twin asked and I glanced back over my shoulder at him.\r\n\tI watched as Hades disappeared from the room, then moved to do as he asked, leaning over my friends’ bodies and taking a piece of jewelry off each of them.\r\n\tHades smiled at me and straightened.\r\n\tHades moved to my side, wrapping one arm around my shoulders.\r\n\tI chewed the inside of my mouth and felt Hades’ eyes on me as he let me sort my thoughts for a few moments, but when he realized I had every intention of keeping it to myself, he pushed.\r\n\tHades moved away from me and turned to face them, putting his hands on his hips.\r\n\t“Yes,” Hades answered him, crossing his arms over his chest, an eyebrow raised.\r\n\t“Ah, yes,” Hades said, coming up in front of him.\r\n\tHades set the ring back down, then turned to face me.\r\n\tHades pulled back into the maze of aether and forcefully pulled an orb out of the Scion’s network.\r\n\t“Of course, if you say it’s true, it must be.” She still sounded skeptical, but I was confident she wouldn’t argue more for the time being, so I nodded and stood again, turning towards Hades.\r\n\tHades sagged against the nearby wall, weak from the power he’d exerted.\r\n\t“Tataru, may I introduce to you Emet-Selch, an Ascian who is also the founder of the Garlean Empire, Solus zos Galvus.”  “You’ll find I put a lot of thought into many things that could impact that Warrior of Light and her wellbeing, Emet-Selch,” he said with conviction and I looked at him once more with a raised brow.\r\n\tI watched as Hades left in a huff and sighed, a headache brewing behind my eyes.\r\n\tI headed out, just to see Hades and the Exarch heading towards me, both Oracles trailing behind them.\r\n\tHades lifted his hand to my cheek for a moment, but then dropped it and headed back into the Crystal Tower.\r\n\tHe inclined his head to me and started following Hades into the Ocular.\r\n\t“A prophecy,” Hades’ voice said from behind me, making me jump in surprise.\r\n\tHades reached up to tuck a lock of hair behind my ear, a coolness to his fingers that was not usually there.\r\n\tWhen I woke in the morning, Hades was already gone.\r\n\t“It should be feasible, yes.” Hades crossed his arms, still examining the portal.\r\n\tThe energy in the air…,” I said to Hades as he approached.\r\n\tI watched Hades carefully as I pretended to read a book, his exhaustion becoming much more apparent as the hours passed.\r\n\tI caught the Crystal Exarch’s eyes when evening hit, Hades’ tiredness spreading to me, and knew instantly that he understood as well.\r\n\t“I believe I can handle the rest from here.” Hades paused for a moment, silent, before finding his words again.\r\n\t“Be quiet, Hades,” she murmured.\r\n\t“Please don’t do this again, Hades.”  “I don’t care, Hades,” I said, lowering my voice, trying to contain my rapidly growing rage.\r\n\tWhen I woke again, Hades had slid out of my grasp and was sitting up in bed, pulling his hand into a fist.\r\n\tI opened my eyes and watched as Hades met her at the door.\r\n\t“As I was saying, Emet-Selch tested the portal himself several times, which I can only imagine was slightly uncomfortable for him.” Have I rubbed off on you in such a short amount of time, Exarch?” Hades asked with a scoff.\r\n\t“So using the tower instead of the Source as the main relay station between the shards worked, then,” Hades inquired and G’raha Tia nodded.\r\n\tHades nodded and brought a hand to his chin, tapping a finger against his lips.\r\n\t“You were reckless, Emet-Selch.”  The room fell silent for a few moments before Hades sighed loudly.\r\n\tHades looked down at me for a moment, but sighed.\r\n\tAfter we ate, Hades insisted that we begin to prepare to head to the shard.\r\n\tHades shrugged one shoulder.\r\n\tI shook my head at Hades, then flicked my wrist, opening the door for her.\r\n\tWhen she pulled away, Hades stepped up to us and she turned to him.\r\n\tNot long later, Hades and I stood side-by-side in front of the portal.\r\n\tHades took stock of the both of us, making sure we weren’t missing any limbs, then looked around at our surroundings.\r\n\t“What’s going on?” My eyes went to Hades.\r\n\t“He said it, didn’t he?” Hades huffed a laugh and shook his head.\r\n\t“Well, we…” I looked at Hades for a moment, who nodded.\r\n\t“How very inaccurate,” Hades spoke up.\r\n\tLater that night, I was awoken suddenly to Hades saying my name in the pitch black of our room.\r\n\tI stepped forward, meaning to go to her, but Hades moved next to me, gripping my arm and pushing me behind him as he shot a blade of arcane energy towards his floating comrade.\r\n\tI could feel Hades’ anger rolling off of him in waves as he made his way over to the lesser Ascian.\r\n\tI looked up at Hades, quickly, to find him watching me as the other Ascian disappeared on the wind in dark particles.\r\n\t“Hades…” I looked up to see Hades kneeling next to me, his expression worried and sad.\r\n\tI heard a sigh behind me as Hades walked up to me.\r\n\tI could feel that my eyes were still swollen from crying the night before, but with a snap, Hades had us dressed and he dragged me out the door.\r\n\tI knew Hades could feel my brooding, but didn’t say anything as I slid under the covers and curled up on my side, back facing him.\r\n\tHades took my hand again and led me through town, stopping in the food quarter to find us something to eat for breakfast.\r\n\tWhen the sun started to go down and I was ready to find lodging for the evening, Hades came to a stop, eyes trained towards the beach.\r\n\tPleased by my change in attitude, Hades tucked my arm through his and we walked down each aisle, pausing to watch children play games for prizes.\r\n\tHades watched me carefully as my mood shifted quickly.\r\n\tThe instruments were rough-hewn, not a drop of varnish, but Hades approached each, a hand on his chin as he examined them all.\r\n\tHades stopped his conversation when he heard my song, surprise and confusion flitting down the bond, but I ignored the questions his mind sent to me.\r\n\tA while later, Hades led me into an inn room we’d rented for the night.\r\n\t“I don’t think I did anything that amazing, Hades.\r\n\tThe one named Emet-Selch is requested upon the Source.\r\n\t“Feo Ul,” I began and reached out to her, a small smile on my face, a laugh threatening to break free as I beheld Hades’ face.\r\n\t“Your Scions did say it was urgent.” Hades put a hand to his chin.\r\n\tHades left for the Source immediately, leaving me with nothing but a tingling kiss on my lips and a promise that he’d try to wrap up quickly so he could rejoin me on my hunt.\r\n\tI was forced to wait nearly an entire day for G’raha Tia to connect the portal to the Eighth, which proved rather boring as the others had already departed for the Empty in the time that Hades and I had spent on the Fourth, no matter how short it seemed to me.\r\n\tI wasn’t sure how I would find this shard of my soul- I admittedly disliked showing up in Convocation robes and scaring the locals into telling us where the hero was, and without Hades to help me, the likelihood of my being able to sense another Ascian close by was low.\r\n\tI thought, for a moment, that perhaps Hades had been trying to contact me through the bond, but it was evident to me after a pause that this was a different kind of pull.\r\n\tI felt the pull the entire evening and decided to contact Hades to update him.\r\n\tWhen I appeared on the Ninth, though, I understood immediately why Hades had warned me about the shard.\r\n\tIt reminded me of Hades’ recreation of Amaurot and my heart squeezed.\r\n\tHades stood there, leaning against the doorframe with his arms crossed.\r\n\tThe fight  between Persephone and Hades before the vote to summon Zodiark.\r\n\tSeeing the memory is one thing, Hades, but feeling it is completely different.\r\n\tI could feel my heartbeat pickup and I was immediately prompted by Hades, despite my anger at him earlier.\r\n\tYes,  Hades said excitedly, his thoughts filled with happiness.\r\n\t“Half of them are gone, Hades,” I said, my voice unsteady but insistent that he listen to me, anyway.\r\n\tThis wasn’t Hades… How could he be saying these things to me?\r\n\t“I know you had hoped that a trace of the man you once knew still remained but...Hades is gone.\r\n\tHades had said… When I raised a brow at him, trying to imitate Hades, he hurried for his helmet and led me to the innards of the castle.\r\n\tWhen he was admitted, I caught a glimpse of Hades, seated at the head of a large table.\r\n\tHades took his leave after the other two agreed.\r\n\tBut how are you  so sure  , Hades?\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “[I love you too, Hades].”  We laid in bed for the rest of the day, Hades putting off his imperial responsibilities to spend time with me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades tilted his head at the soldier’s audacity and I could only imagine his expression."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Finally, the man looked at Hades again, though it obviously made him uncomfortable."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I quickly stepped out from the shadows, holding the sheet closed around me, and put my hand on Hades’ arm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I looked at Hades again with a raised brow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades slowed us to a stop and turned to put his hands on my shoulders, leaning down to my level."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A few nights later, I found myself sitting in a reserved box at the theatre Hades had built in Solus’ youth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I had shrunk under the stares of the other officials also attending the performance, the rumor mill spinning around the room as Hades led me to our seats, where he regaled me with the tale of how this building came to exist- an accomplishment he held close to his heart."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was disappointed I would not  be attending the celebration with him, but while I was a citizen of Eorzea and had participated in various meetings of the same nature, this wasn’t  my  responsibility nor did I feel I was needed to help keep the peace with the Scions in attendance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A few minutes after they had finished, Hades left a soft kiss on my lips and departed for the meeting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The gait of whoever was in the main room didn’t match Hades’."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades...  “One last time, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “[Hades, I’m fine],” she responded, her hand moving to my bleeding shoulder, placing some pressure on it and I winced."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My eyes flicked to the wall for a moment before back to Hades, the realization striking me that if not for the Blessing of Light, I would likely have died."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When I heard the movement of his armor, I looked to the doorway as Hades limped past to another room, leaning heavily on Gaius’ shoulder."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My heart plummeted in my chest at the thought of being away from Hades for the night, but I was in no position to refuse, so I nodded my understanding as those working on my injury washed the blood out of my hair and I closed my eyes, feeling the cool water on my scalp against the raging heat in my head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I opened my mouth to tell him what a long story that was- but Hades pushed his way into the room, his armor and shirt removed, a bandage wrapped around his shoulder."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Yes,” Hades answered when I opened my mouth to respond with an emphatic  no  ."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “How does it look?” Hades asked the other man, who dismissed his assistants and came around so I could see him as he addressed us both."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades lifted his brows, the words dying one his tongue."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If you have any more pain take another vial.” He looked back up at Hades again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades lifted me from the bed, a pained expression on his face from the exertion, and opened a portal."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I dismissed the girl attending me to get some lunch as the Elder Seedseer eyed Hades, sitting at a desk in the corner of the room, and then sat down on a cushioned chair next to me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The scratching of Hades’ pen came to a stop as he watched her out of the corner of his eye."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That remains to be seen,” Hades mumbled from the corner, causing a breath of a laugh to come from the Elder Seedseer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A while later, when Hades had finished his official paperwork, he sent for his cello."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It  is  , but it’s too much, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I am Emet-Selch, the Ascian who founded the Garlean Empire.” Emet-Selch has proven time and time again that his word is his bond.”   Hades, this is more than the dress,  she insisted, looking up at me as we stepped off the final step to the intermediate landing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I joined my friends as Hades went about making a speech to his people."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The dress she’d chosen was knee-length and pale pink with a boatneck top, black butterflies sewn into the sheer over-layer of tulle in her skirt and tied around the middle with a black ribbon, matching the one Hades had given her before we left initially, which she still wore braided into her hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Oracle of Darkness inclined her head te me, then looked up towards the pedestal Hades was standing on and nodded her head towards him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Behind us, a couple of older court ladies spoke of Hades in hushed tones, though loud enough for me to catch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She pushed against my side and I humored her, walking around the room as we waited for Hades to finish his obligatory rounds."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “This is your first time on the Source, is it not?” Hades inquired."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I cannot allow you to do that, my beloved,” Hades said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I looked up at Hades, who nodded."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I looked to Hades and I knew he saw the worry in my eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My piece- Hades had called it a sonata- started slow and sad."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The room erupted in deafening applause and I felt a tug on the tether, Hades urging me to stand with him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When confusion crossed her features, Hades released my arm and bent down to her, holding his hand out towards her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You don’t just refuse an emperor, Ryne.” I watched, a soft smile of my face, as they went spinning towards the dance floor, Hades patiently showing her the steps, just as he had done for me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I felt an arm wrap around my waist and looked up to find Hades standing beside me, done with the waltz he’d shared with Ryne."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She looked up at Hades, her face suddenly stern, as she pointed a finger in his direction."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I could sense Hades’ discomfort and annoyance at the girl and he clenched his jaw."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The longer I stared, the more turmoil it wrought inside me and I frowned deeply, thinking about what Hades had  just  told me about using my abilities."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I furrowed my brow as I felt Hades step up behind me and the realization laid over me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I don’t want this to happen again, Hades” After an amused stroke down the tether between us, I shot Hades a look, unable to keep the sly smile from my lips, but when I noticed Gaia watching us with a raised brow, I cleared my throat and looked away from her, focusing back on my food."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades noticed it as well, and tilted his head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even Hades seemed slightly taken aback at her vague admission."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Y-your Radiance!” Hades lifted a brow and motioned for him to continue."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Get out,” Hades said to the soldier, his rage starting to boil over."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Instantly, Hades was up, staring the twin down."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thancred looked as though he was about to argue, but Hades forcefully pulled him through, his panic pulsing down our tether."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades came up behind me and she smiled when she saw him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They rushed in and stopped next to Hades, who whirled on the doctor, his relief replaced with rage."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I want the soldier responsible for this mess brought to me, immediately,” I heard Hades order from the doorway."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I looked to Hades again, who looked incredibly put-out by the doctor’s words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “This is hardly a disappointment, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I would...  love  to have children with you one day, Hades.” He looked back up to me, eyes wide, as if I’d caught him off-guard."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’m… so sorry, Hades,” she said softly and I looked up at her, forcing a smile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After a while, though, I furrowed my brow as, in the corner of Hades’ vision, I saw an extremely bright light."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Much brighter now against the night than when I had peered at Hades’ golden- Aside from Hades, there was only one other unsundered soul left in this universe."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked around again, trying to focus in on the surrounding around the other Ascian."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My eyes widened and I gripped Hades’ arm tightly, a cry escaping me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades moved to place himself between me and Elidibus and crossed his arms."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Have you stooped so low now that you’ll attack when someone’s back is turned?” Hades asked with a shake of his head, ignoring the previous comment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked over his shoulder at me, shaking his head nearly imperceptibly, then summoned his crystalline staff to his hand and turned back to the other Ascian."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Why did you stop me?” I asked Hades, trying to keep my voice quiet and steady."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You don’t have to,” Hades assured me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Once I absorbed it, Hades came up behind me, leaning down to grip my arm and pull me to my feet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades asked me to join souls in an Eternal Bond!” I exclaimed, my excitement bubbling over so far that I almost yelled the words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I dropped to the ground again, Hades’ arm coming with me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “He wasn’t always like this, was he?” Hades shook his head and reached for my hand, running his thumb over the knuckles."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Are we doing the right thing?” Hades’ voice asked, muffled, as he sat forward in a chair, face in his palm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" From the looks of it, they were in Hades’ apartment, devoid of all of his soulmate’s things."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Honestly?” the other man asked, to which Hades nodded."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This is our best bet.” Hades sighed, defeated, and nodded his head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It is unfortunate that you have come to bear the blame but, Hades, know that I will always be on your side.” Hades leaned forward to wipe them away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watched me for a few moments, sending waves of comfort to me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When I had calmed down, I stood up from Hades’ lap and reached down to help him up as well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I paused when I saw the red soul I’d seen earlier, pacing back and forth… Hades knocked on the door with his foot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We tried but...we were too late.” I averted my eyes when I saw the man’s chin tremble, but he nodded knowingly and Hades moved to pass the girl over to him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Thank you for bringing her back to me.” Hades dipped his head to the hero’s father and turned to me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When we arrived back to the First, it was quite late, so Hades quickly explained what happened to G’raha Tia, then walked back with me to our room."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I felt a tug on the bond and looked up to find Hades sitting on the bench under my open window."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Heat spread through the entirety of my body as he released his burning desire for me into the bond and Hades gripped my hips, guiding me up and back down again so that he entered me slowly, savoring every second of the sensation as my soul, so close to completion, mingled with his."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When I woke the next morning, I opened my eyes to Hades walking out from the bathing room, his hair wet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Sorry?” Hades asked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Well, just after our final battle,” I began again, earning a frown from Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I made my way to her, Hades on my heels."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I quickly looked up at Hades, who tilted his head to the side, hand going to his mouth in thought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Alright, I have to go before Emet-Selch gets more impatient,” she said and I rolled my eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Your words, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That  is  Emet-Selch, you idiot.” There’s no way those aren’t Emet-Selch’s cheekbones,” she remarked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It will be fine, Hades,” she interjected with a small smile and a reassuring nod."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades, my love, not so tightly,” an achingly familiar voice said softly, with the slightest hint of a laugh, the pitch and lilt of it one that I had not heard in eons."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Have you moved on so decidedly that you're more worried about her than happy to see me, Hades?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “She loves you so much, Hades, that she has allowed me the opportunity to speak with you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You have to concede that you were wrong to her, Hades, she whispered, happiness laced with sadness dancing in her mind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “[I will always love you, Hades],” she said with a warm smile when I nodded."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And you...have given Hades more than I ever could.” I shook my head, and looked down, a sad smile spreading across my face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I closed my eyes for a moment, remembering the last conversation I tried having with Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Knowing full well that the Eternal Bond had gone dormant in the wake of Zodiark’s summoning, I still silently begged Hades to stay safe."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You knew and you said nothing, letting this burden pass to Hades while you sat in comfortable retirement.” “He always was able to see right through me in a way Hades never understood."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I suppose it was a good thing I let him die to that beast after Hades departed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Really, Hades never did compare to him.”  “Hades,” I breathed, the intense feeling of relief not only mine, but his has well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades eyed me for a moment, confusion in his thoughts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stood, gripping my hand, tightly, and pulled me up with him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And to make sure I knew the truth.” I tightened my hand around Hades’ and looked to the ground."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I smiled, heading to follow her on to the ship, but Hades pulled me back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You could just takes us back with you.” Hades scoffed at her forwardness and raised an eyebrow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, we definitely met at the spring celebration,” she said quietly and I breathed a laugh, shaking my head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “  You  have to stop blaming yourself, Hades,” she insisted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Do I have your permission to call you Hades, then?” Very well, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had been right, afterall."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I felt fingers wrap around my wrist and Hades spun me around to face him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’m-” When Hades paused, I followed his gaze to the Mother."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I looked up at Hades with wide eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I am well aware that your allegiance lies with my champion and not with me.” Hades scoffed and crossed his arms over his chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her loyalties are to Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades put a hand on my shoulder, knowing the thoughts that were spinning through my mind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades wrapped his arm around my shoulders, pride finding its way down the tether to me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades rushed forward to catch her before she hit the ground."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I exchanged a glance with Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades came up on the girl’s other side as we started heading back to Ishgard and to the Lord Commander’s office."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was surprised to see part of the area restored, and I’d forgotten I hadn’t...actually explained how we’d met Gaia in the first place."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I quickened my pace to follow them, Hades right on my heels, taking in the giant being we were approaching."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “But you weren’t able to,” Hades deduced."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch, you will likely need to go back and help the Exarch with the portal."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We don’t know yet how we will make the trip to the shard and we should be prepared for anything.” Hades nodded his agreement as well and we went to board Eden."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With Hades there to help, defeating them was much easier than it had been before, but I knew that he would be heading back to the Crystarium before we finished to get a head start."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades parted the flap and joined me, wrapping one arm around my waist."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watched me carefully, curious, as I refused to betray my thoughts to him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When I looked back at Hades with wide eyes, he was smirking at me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades pulled away from my lips to look at me as his movements started picking up speed and I was unable to stop the cry that escaped me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “This is Emet-Selch, he is untempered, free of the binding to Zodiark and able to think for himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch, Warrior of Light,” Gaia said with intensity and abundant confidence, without looking at us."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When the Oracles finally emerged, they came to stand between me and Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I looked back at Hades for a moment, eyes wide, before I wound my arms around the Oracle, one hand threading in her long hair, palm flat against the back of her head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When I had gone to sit next to him, Hades had grabbed me by the wrist and pulled me down into his lap, then wrapped his arms loosely around me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I know only what Eden told me.” Hades’ arms tightened around me and I leaned my head to the side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ascian intervention, more than likely,” Hades interjected."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades nodded."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When you woke, you realized Emet-Selch was still here  and  that he was untempered.”  Hades nodded, understanding entirely her situation as, not so long ago, he was feeling the same."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades ran his hands up and down my arms as he felt my mind spinning with this new information."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Find friendship.” She looked pointedly to Hades and I, then, a sly smile forming on her face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I felt Hades’ chest vibrate as he cleared his throat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Finally, Hades prompted me to stand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades leaned against the frame of the portal as Ryne talked animatedly, watching her closely."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Her gaze landed on Hades, he clenched his jaw and crossed his arms over his chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If I were not the benevolent God I am, I would have just taken you and been done with it.” Beside me, Hades scoffed and rolled his eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch,” Alisaie admonished."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So afraid was He that I would use the inhabitants of your star against Him, that He created a soul and imbued it with His power- His  blessing  - turning whoever was born with it into a champion of Darkness.” Her gaze slid to Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Neither of us thought it a possibility, but it happened nonetheless.” Next to me, Hades’ annoyance intensified."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This was one of the few things I did not expect.” Hades was nearly seething now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It is true that I did not offer up the whole truth, but I did not lie.” Hades scoffed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Dormant because of a lock  you  put on her,” Hades said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We understand,” Hades muttered, his patience all but hanging by a thread."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades continued to sit with his arms crossed, but he tensed again, eyes narrowing at Her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Do they  really  never read between the lines?” Hades mumbled under his breath, just barely loud enough for me to catch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I wasn’t sure if it was my own instincts, that of my soulmate, or both, but Hades refused to look at me as he sat, simmering, the chatter around us only making it worse."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Aren’t you forgetting something?” Hades piped up, finally, locking eyes with Hydaelyn, trying to keep his voice steady through his rage."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch,” the astrologian admonished at my blatant disrespect, but I ignored him, intently focused on Hydaelyn."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “At the very least, we can see if they have any information we do not currently have from the wealth of knowledge Emet-Selch, the Warrior of Light and Ryne currently hold.” We all want to fight, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades, beloved by the Underworld, gifted with the Sight, one of the most powerful archmages to ever exist."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A laugh escaped me as I watched Hades’ brow nearly rise entirely off his face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’ hand slid into mine as I stood upright again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I tried to keep it from the bond to the best of my ability, but I was sure Hades had noticed, though he didn’t say anything."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When the power had died down, Hades examined her, closely."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades came to stand in front of me as I hoisted my bag onto my back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Can we be on our way?” I glanced back at Hades for a moment, who chuckled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “The Scions and Emet-Selch are spread across the star to see if we could recruit our many friends and acquaintances for the sake of the world.” I sighed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades prompted me again, asking if I needed him to come."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A void portal opened next to me and Hades stepped through."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I nodded my head in their direction and Hades turned to face them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades laughed at his reaction, then looked to Cid for a moment and leaned down to Nero with a grin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Cid, recovered from his surprise, placed himself next to me as he chuckled, watching the interaction continue, Hades making the poor man incredibly uncomfortable."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then, I have something extremely important to discuss with you.” When he nodded his understanding, I grabbed ahold of Hades and Gaia so we could be on our way, Nero still gaping at us as we left the building."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I took a quick look around, then looked to Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stepped up next to me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I was...drawn to it.” Hades and I exchanged a glance, then looked towards Gaia."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I opened my mouth to argue, but Hades grabbed my wrist to stop me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When I outed him as an Ascian, Hades changed his physique back to the original and reached for my hand as I explained, demonstrated even, what I  really  was to them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I felt irritation flit down the bond and took a moment to give Hades an encouraging smile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I breathed a laugh, then followed Hades into the other."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I hardly think you can consider me your hero, Hades,” she said softly, her eyes downcast."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch, on the other hand, is Dark-aspected.\r\n\t“On that note,” Alisaie started, “Why is it that Emet-Selch doesn’t have an affinity?\r\n\t“If it isn’t the most eminent Emet-Selch,” he said simply with a respectful bow of his head.\r\n\t“But I really thought you and I were closer than this, Emet-Selch.\r\n\t“I wonder how Emet-Selch messed it up so badly.” “Perhaps he’s just upset that, of the two of us, I maintained my youthful good looks and charm, whereas time has done Emet-Selch no favors.”  “Oh come now, Hades.\r\n\tIt was foretold that Emet-Selch and Halmarut would bond,” she said with a knowing nod.\r\n\tTell me, my friend, do you have them call you Emet-Selch?” he asked as he eyed the Scions warily, their expressions matching his as they regarded him with suspicion.\r\n\t“He has a point, Hades.” What say you, Emet-Selch?”  When I woke in the morning, before the sun, my backside was still flush against Hades’ body, his arms holding me tightly to him.\r\n\t“Hades, please,” I said, my impatience making itself known.\r\n\t[I love you, Hades],  my mind said to his as I closed my eyes and pressed my forehead to his.\r\n\tWith a sigh, Hades dropped his face in his palm.\r\n\tA few days later, I was sitting on a bench, taking a break and getting a drink of water after an intense round of magical drills with Hades.\r\n\tWhen my knees buckled, I grabbed ahold of Hades’ arm to keep from falling.\r\n\tI huffed a laugh and wiped the water from my face, then turned back to Hades my mouth tugging upward.\r\n\tHades reached out to him, clapping him on the shoulder.\r\n\t“Over dinner, perhaps,” Hades said, looking around at the rest of the group.\r\n\tWith a snap of his fingers, Hades started the flame, but let it grow on its own as he sat down.\r\n\t“I believe the reason She was not able to restore more of your Convocation was because fragments of their souls...have already been risen up and claimed.” Lahabrea sat up straight and exchanged a look with Hades.\r\n\t“That reminds me,” Hades began again.\r\n\tI huffed as they reprised our other friend of the situation, crossing my arms over my chest as Hades ran his hands up and down my arms, trying to comfort me.\r\n\tI looked up at Hades and he nodded, knowingly, as he continued his conversation.\r\n\t“Mm,” I hummed, looking back up to where Hades, Lahabrea, and Hythlodaeus were gathered, smiles on their faces as they joked around about the old days in Amaurot.\r\n\tWith a smile, I gripped his hand and led him over to where Hades sat by the fire.\r\n\t“To defeat your enemies, you need the element of surprise on your side,” Hades explained as he, Thancred, and I stood on opposites sides of the arena.\r\n\tThis time, however, Hades sensed me behind him and side-stepped my bolt of lightning, then shot a burst of arcane energy at both of us simultaneously.\r\n\tHades took off into the air, putting distance between him and us before casting an onslaught of spells in quick succession, forcing us to dodge.\r\n\tThe Scion went flying across the arena, and Hades was immediately on me.\r\n\tMy brow furrowed and with a shake of my head, he slowly melted back into Hades.\r\n\t“Emet-Selch!” Y’shtola admonished, now standing on top of the wall she had been sitting on.\r\n\tHades held his free hand out, warning him not to come closer, his eyes never leaving mine.\r\n\tHades cleared his throat and squatted down in front of me.\r\n\t“I wonder if we should show them what they should expect,” he said, coming to a stop next to Hades.\r\n\tIt will not help them against Zodiark, of course, but I doubt anything will.” Hades considered the proposal and nodded.\r\n\t“You do look… peculiar, Emet-Selch.\r\n\t“Let’s begin with an obvious observation: Emet-Selch is a mage,” he began, all traces of the wittiness he tended towards gone now that he was teaching.\r\n\t“Do not fall for His manipulation, Emet-Selch.\r\n\t“Do not listen to Him, Hades,” his lips shaped but I could not hear the words.\r\n\t“Zodiark never intended to spare her, Hades.\r\n\tWhen the three had finished their conversation, the privacy bubble Hythlodaeus had Created popped and he stepped away to join us as Hades and Lahabrea got into position.\r\n\tI tried to focus as Hades transformed and repeated a few of his abilities I recalled seeing when I fought him those months ago, but suddenly, I felt my heart skip a beat.\r\n\tShe lifted a hand to her chin, eyes narrowing towards Hades.\r\n\tHades released the aether he’d been holding onto, and with a gust of wind around us, he started shrinking back into his normal body.\r\n\tWhen he thought I was steady enough, Hythlodaeus released my arm and rushed forwards with Lahabrea, but when they got close, a barrier sprang up around Hades, the Father forcing him to keep his friends at a distance.\r\n\tI cringed as Hades locked eyes with me- and even without the bond, I could tell he  finally  recognized me again.\r\n\tI felt the bond open a miniscule amount, and I knew as Hades  tried  to come to my side the he had felt my agony as his own.\r\n\t“No, she hasn’t,” Hades insisted, purple eyes locking with mine again.\r\n\tI felt Hades’ mind shift at His offer to spare me, and I shook my head violently, trying to force myself forward, trying to tell him  no  , but I only ended up leaning on my hands and knees, gasping for breath as my head pulsed, my vision beginning to fade around the edges, the pain in my chest returning as my soulmate, desperate to keep me from this battle, let himself be manipulated.\r\n\tShe rushed forward as the barrier around Hades finally disintegrated.\r\n\tLahabrea seemed to notice it too, tearing it from Hades’ hand, but nearly immediately dropped it to the ground, moving to grab ahold of his friend’s face, forcing him to focus.\r\n\t“You are  stronger  than His hold on your soul, my friend,” Lahabrea insisted and I watched Hades blink, his eyes filling with panic as they exchanged more words, quiet enough that I could not hear.\r\n\tMy brow furrowed as my head pulsed with pain, but I leaned forward and pressed my forehead against Hades’, sending my Light to him in a steady stream, praying that this would work.\r\n\tAs Lahabrea started speaking behind us, I tuned him out, continuing to whisper reassuring words into Hades’ ear.\r\n\t“What is it?” Hades averted his eyes from mine, looking down at my chest.\r\n\tWhen Hades had fallen asleep, I loosened my arms from around him, watching the skin on his face soften the deeper into sleep he went.\r\n\tIn the early morning, unable to sleep any longer, I quietly slipped out of Hades’ arms before the sun came up and found myself staring down a wooden practice dummy, my mind heavy with the previous day’s events.\r\n\tI closed my eyes and sighed, placing one hand over my chest, a memory of the ache I’d felt while Zodiark was speaking to Hades making my heart clench.\r\n\tLater that night, when the sun had slipped below the horizon and we called it a night, instead of spending time with the others by the firepit, I went back to my room to check on Hades.\r\n\t“No-!” I squealed, but Hades was standing over me in an instant, hands going to my waist.\r\n\tWhen we had calmed down and finished, I cleared the table as Hades pushed the coffee table out of the way and sat on the floor in front of the fireplace, leaning his back against the couch cushions.\r\n\tHades chuckled and I deflated a little at his reaction.\r\n\tI felt pride trickle into me from Hades as he continued to watch me in awe of my newfound passion, my eagerness to make myself, and by extension, everyone, better.\r\n\t“Be that as it may,  Hades  , I figured I could save you the effort,” he retorted as he cut me off in return, holding a dish out for me.\r\n\t“Just as He did to Hades.\r\n\tI wonder… had the connection not been interrupted, would He have re-tempered Hades as well?”  “No, Hades, you were anything but weak,” the Speaker said, a fervent conviction in his voice that pulled my gaze up to meet his.\r\n\tHades, please,” she laughed.\r\n\tWith a content sigh, I leaned my back against Hades’ chest as I lazily ran the tips of my fingers through the water, creating small ripples around us.\r\n\tWhen Hades had finished washing my hair, I sat up again and slicked it back, out of my face.\r\n\tWith a chuckle, Hades nudged me so that I stood.\r\n\t“Oh, never you mind, my young pupil,” Hades said, laying an arm across my shoulders, his tone light and jovial.\r\n\tI tilted my head towards Hades once again, crossing my arms over my chest, one brow raising as I recalled a certain bet we had made in the fields of Lakeland, a promise to play a prank on my friends he had yet to carry out.\r\n\t“Did Hades put you up to this?”  One day, though, Alisaie had suggested, to nearly everyone’s chagrin, that we  actually  use the masks Hades and Hythlodaeus had given them during the battle.\r\n\tI felt a hand on my leg and tilted my head towards Hades, who gave me a reassuring squeeze in response to my thoughts.\r\n\t“Let them believe their gods had saved them,” Hades mused with a raised brow.\r\n\t“What a life that would be,” Hades said, voice barely above a whisper.\r\n\tOne side of my mouth tugged upward as I shook my head, then turned back to Hades, looking into the amber hue of his eyes.\r\n\tWhen we were very nearly at our time limit, Hades, Hythlodaeus, and I travelled back to the First to catch up with the Crystal Exarch, who had been hard at work with the returned Amaurotines.\r\n\tHades and I watched them for a long while, testing the barrier.\r\n\tBut when the sun started to dip below the horizon, Hades took hold of my hand and opened a portal.\r\n\tI pursed my lips but let Hades pull me through to the other side, wherever it was.\r\n\tHades squeezed my hand and spun me back to face him.\r\n\t“It’s called a funnel cake,” Hades informed me as he broke off a piece and popped it into his mouth.\r\n\tHades chuckled as I slid out of his arm to avoid the cold, following me as I made for dry sand.\r\n\t“It wasn’t just  a little  crispy, Hades.\r\n\tI absently lifted my hand to my lips to rid myself of the sticky residue, but Hades caught my wrist.\r\n\tHades’ arms loosened around me, hands moving to prompt me to look up, but I refused to lift my head.\r\n\t“Hades, please,” she panted, bucking her hips roughly upwards.\r\n\t“Hades,  please.\r\n\t“Isn’t there something missing, Emet-Selch?” Elidibus taunted.\r\n\t“Have you figured it out, Emet-Selch?\r\n\tI left Hades on the cliff as Elidibus approached, only looking back at him once before throwing myself into the beginnings of the fighting.\r\n\tThe beast withered to the ground and I nodded to Hades over my shoulder before heading for another part of the Flats.\r\n\tThe bond between Hades and I strained as his heartbeat picked up at the sight of the god in front of us, a myriad of feelings pouring in from him, so strong that I almost stumbled as I made my way to him.\r\n\tOn his other side, Lahabrea barely breathed as he watched, then exchanged a glance with Hades.\r\n\t“I can’t help but notice, Emet-Selch, that you almost sound remorseful.” Hades breathed a laugh and looked down to the ground, the hand at his chest pulling into a fist.\r\n\tHades was at my side in a moment as the brightness faded, revealing mechanical dreadnoughts, spiders, drones, and spherical nodes of all sizes, most notably the Automated Defense Systems I remembered fighting in the Coils of Bahamut.\r\n\tHades scoffed next to me and crossed his arms over his chest.\r\n\tI took Hades’ hand for a moment and squeezed it before jumping back into the air.\r\n\tSuddenly, I felt a tug on my mind, Hades asking if I was okay.\r\n\tHades caught me quickly, huffing a laugh in my ear at the choice words running through my fading mind, slight amusement floating over the bond to me.\r\n\tI forced the flap of the tent open to find Hades and Hythlodaeus standing at the edge of the cliff we were camped on.\r\n\t“  Hades  ,” I said, my voice unsteady, my feet sliding on some loose rubble as I made my way to them.\r\n\tHades held his hand to me and I gripped it tightly as he pulled me into him, tucking me into his side.\r\n\tHades’ arm reached further behind me, bunching his hand in the back of our friend’s robe to keep him close.\r\n\t“We need to retreat,” Hades said with finality, a sense of dread filling the bond between us.\r\n\tI narrowed my eyes at him,  everything  in me wanting to fight him, but Hades’ command to pull back the only thing staying my hand.\r\n\t“How would your  beloved  Emet-Selch feel if you let yourself die now?” No wonder Hades likes you so much.” Hades came out of a tent, concern in his eyes.\r\n\tI ground my teeth together and stomped away, intentionally shoving Hades with my shoulder as I passed.\r\n\t“We can’t just kill them.” He looked over Hades’ shoulder when he saw me, eyes widening for a moment.\r\n\tMy being tempered did not stop you from killing me and  now  you choose to abstain from violence?” Hades shot back at me, my own fury seeping into him as well, affecting his own mood.\r\n\tI spied Elidibus and Hades fighting.\r\n\tMy eyes darted back to Hades, his back to the Father as he stared at Elidibus with a furrowed brow.\r\n\t“Emet-Selch, finish your food.\r\n\t“She needs space, for now, Hades.\r\n\t“Emet-Selch and I had a discussion,” he started once more as the Warrior of Light entered the tent.\r\n\t“Of those among us comfortable with our magic to use teleportation, Emet-Selch and Lahabrea are the ones with the most experience against these beasts.\r\n\tHe was very adamant that his failure was a result of Emet-Selch’s meddling, with another white-robed Emissary at his side.\r\n\t“Now why would Emet-Selch ask for information on the Warrior of Light of that shard, I wondered?\r\n\t“Our daughter, Hades,” she breathed, a bright smile spreading across her face.\r\n\t“Her soul is fading, Hades,” he said softly, a tremble in his voice as his eyes remained locked on her.\r\n\t[I love you, Hades,]  she said to my mind as her hand began to slip from my cheek.\r\n\tIt's alright, Hades.” A whisper from nearby as a hand rubbed up and down my back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Before she hit the ground, however, I saw Emet-Selch shoot across the sky from wherever he’d been to catch her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I looked back to the Emet-Selch desperately trying to infuse his own aether into the Warrior of Light, and as hopeful as I was, I knew, in the back of my mind, that it wouldn’t work."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A few moments later, Emet-Selch passed her to Elidibus and started standing, promising to find a healer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I turned back, and after a few more whispered words, I saw her relax in Emet-Selch’s arms with a faint smile on her lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ” Elidibus reached out to put his hand on Emet-Selch’s shoulder, but he shrugged it off, nearly shoving the Emissary back to the ground with the force, and summoned his staff as he floated into the air."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I turned away as Hythlodaeus wrapped his arms around Emet-Selch, clenching my jaw as I struggled to keep from breaking down with him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch sagged, then, and everyone focused on him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “There was no other way to calm the torrential grief that filled him, young child of Hydaelyn,” He answered, though His words did nothing to calm me, even admitting that He would release Emet-Selch once He was finished."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My heart broke all over again as we listened in stunned silence at Emet-Selch’s desperate plea."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My eyes widened as I looked up, Zodiark placing His hand once more on Emet-Selch’s head, ready to do as he had requested."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Eventually, Emet-Selch sagged again, the hope he had felt wearing thin once more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She stood upright, her back to Emet-Selch, still facing Zodiark, as we stared at her with wide eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “He said Emet-Selch would be freed after He spoke to us,” Alisaie remarked bitterly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” I heard her voice say softly and I tensed slightly at how  real  it sounded."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It would be amusing if it wasn’t Emet-Selch.” “Grief can manifest in a great many ways, Emet-Selch, but I assure you, you are quite sane.”  “Hades,” Hythlodaeus remarked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is no fool."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “All the same, Emet-Selch had no way of knowing the Warrior of Light could or  would  be resurrected, so I cannot fault him for protecting his mind in such a way,” Alphinaud said quietly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I know what it’s like, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “She speaks the truth, Emet-Selch,” Y'shtola commented quietly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades, please,” she whispered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh, Hades,” she whispered sadly, reaching for my hands once more, imbuing the healing Light into them again, her hands squeezing mine tightly so I could not pull them away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch, on the other hand,” Igeyorhm said with a shuddering breath as she pulled back, wiping her face with the sleeve of her robe."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “No, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch played favorites,” Loghrif chimed in with a sigh, though a smile was present on his face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That does not change the fact that Emet-Selch felt the need to induct someone into the Convocation without our approval,” Fandaniel chimed in cheerfully."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I am Emet-Selch no more if it pleases the esteemed Convocation.” I glanced at Hythlodaeus with a sharp intake of breath, both of us understanding, and we all followed quickly, turning the corner just in time to see Hades pin Cronus against the brick wall of a tall building, his sudden change of mood causing his aether to kick up, a sudden wind blowing as the Darkness swirled around him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’re causing quite a scene, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I felt Hades’ anger spark inside of me and I balled my hands into fists as his arm started shaking."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You lost that privilege with all of the things you’ve done,” Hades growled, his voice barely above a whisper as he tried to contain his rage, the low reverberation vibrating through my own chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus put a hand on Hades’ shoulder and leaned in close."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch,” Hermes began, a warning in his voice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I squeezed Alphinaud’s shoulder before sliding my fingers into Hades’."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’ve become so strong, Hades, and all because of  me  ."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My hand clamped around Hades’ as I whipped around, unable to stop myself, free hand punching Cronus square in the nose, knocking his mask askew."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You will address him as Emet-Selch,” I said, poison dripping from my words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I think I much preferred how you looked before.” I clenched my jaw as Hades scoffed and shook his head in disbelief."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Perfect.” Hades snapped and immediately, Cronus’ hands were bound behind his back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Very much so, yes.” Hades leaned down to me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Maybe if you and Lahabrea weren’t so  exhausting  to babysit-” Hades breathed a laugh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You have done us a favor by tracking him down.” She looked at Hades, a small smile on her lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “But he also seems...confident that he is not at fault.” Hades squeezed my hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “The Oracles are on our side,” Hades continued."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We won’t force you.” Hades reached behind me, wrapping his arm around my shoulders and I settled into him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The day of the trial, I gripped Hades’s hand tightly as he entered the temple, my stomach twisting in nervous knots as I mentally prepared myself to show the contents of my memories in front of the populace of Amaurot- my friends, my neighbors, my colleagues."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, as well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As it did, I could feel Hades’ barely concealed anger surfacing and I looked up to him, sending waves of assurances and comfort to him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The both of you have been brought before us accused of murder.” Hades’ hand slid over my leg, giving it a comforting squeeze as I bit my lip."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What would Hades think if we left her here to die?” My hand moved to grip Hades’, still resting on my thigh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Who’s to say that Emet-Selch didn’t plant those memories in their minds himself?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" On Hades’ other side, Hythlodaeus tensed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades turned, too, and went to place a hand on our friend’s shoulder, but he shot out of his seat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades nodded and Hythlodaeus averted his eyes for a moment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Shouting for Hades to come back to me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus landed on the ground next to Hades, shooting the smiling beast with many mouths with several bolts of lighting, his other hand raising in the air to shoot warning signals."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked over his shoulder when he heard it, his attention split between the monster and his duty to protect his people."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades clenched his jaw."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Go, Hades,” Cronus insisted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Architect paused for a moment and exchanged a glance with his friend, With a sigh, Hythlodaeus nodded and Hades took off towards the other citizens."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I jumped in my seat with a gasp at the suddenness of the action and Hades’ hand clamped around my own as he watched."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When a break was announced so they could prepare to interview the Convocation and prove their temperings were broken, Gaia approached Hades and I."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “For your old mentor, Hades, listen to me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Think of how much I did for you.” Hades scoffed, then, releasing my hand to cross his hands over his chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “So you were, what?” Hades asked, huffing a humorless laugh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades clicked his tongue and shook his head once more, then turned on his heels and walked out of the room without another word."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch, a moment before we continue?” “If it was not approved through the Bureau of the Architect, if no such blueprint exists based on Emet-Selch’s recollection and that of his apprentice, this warrants further Convocation involvement."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch will come,” he said finally, interrupting the conversation with his loud tone as the whispering waned for a moment, seemingly appeased."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch was not fighting alongside those loyal to Zodiark at that time and thus would not have had a hand in their creation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “But Emet-Selch should  not  have been tempered while training on the Fourth shard."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Why not elaborate, Emet-Selch?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It does not look good for you to hide things, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “This was your doing, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her soulmate, her equal, is the man who currently holds the seat of Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Then logic dictates that Hades is the soul who will build the city to greatness,” Hythlodaeus continued with a smile in his voice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Regarding the matter of Emet-Selch's state of mind, we Oracles have determined that he is free of Zodiark's tempering,” Ryne stated loudly as she turned back to address the crowd, regaining command of the room."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If you wish to rest, I’m sure something can be arranged, but the position of Emet-Selch is yours."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades and I will see you around soon, though!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Of course you can, baby,” I said, a smile spreading across my mouth and I leaned down to lift her into our bed as Hades pushed the quilt back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The door stood slightly ajar and I pushed it further open, finding Hades sitting on the bed, a purple ribbon dangling from one hand, our daughter standing between his legs as he attempted to tame her wild hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’ll have you know,” Hades began again, unable to keep the laugh from his voice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I set her on my hip as Hades approached."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Urianger, Moenbryda, and Hermes have already gone ahead.” He clapped Hades on the back in greeting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Multiple laughs filled the air and I reached for Hades’ hand, looking back to find the previous Speaker of the Convocation playfully leaning on Igeyorhm, their eyes locked on each other with smirks on their lips, exchanging silent words between their minds, the bond between them still new."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I don’t think-” Hades started."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a content sigh, I leaned against Hades side again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I scoffed and Hades raised a brow before looking at me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades gave me a quizzical look and I pointed to the older children gathered around his legs, marvelling as he tossed small darts to the back, accurately striking enchanted balloons with each throw."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a hum, Hades leaned down, pressing his lips to my cheek."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I elbowed Hades in the side, interrupting his conversation as she flicked her wrist, a clean, dry towel appearing in her free hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades pushed past me to grab her outstretched wrist, forcefully pulling her to the side, away from any prying eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Tell me why, Meli,” Hades said with a sigh, fingers going under her chin and lifting her head up so she could see the seriousness in his eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Given my rank in the Convocation, it’s very important that we lead by example,” Hades said, finishing for me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stood then, holding his hand out to her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “After dinner.” Hades’ gaze slid to me for a moment, sending his intentions to me over our bond."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades rushed to the front then, trying to stifle his laugh as he patted Urianger on the shoulder and turned to face the children and their parents."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ryne,” Hades called over him, looking back towards where we were standing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “He promised.” I breathed a laugh and looked towards Hades, still leaning against the stage next to Ryne as the young crowd bombarded her with questions about the battle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Meli had chosen her crepe stand and Hades accepted her rolanberry-and-chocolate treat, we sat at a small, nearby table for customers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades quirked a brow at me as he felt my mind churning."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked past me, then, as the sun began to set over my shoulder."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The people in attendance ceased speaking and waited with bated breath as Hades appeared, now clad in his travel robes and mask, his dark aether swirling around him, hovering a few fulms in the air, above the crowd."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades nodded nearly imperceptibly to us and raised his hands, palms up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The brutish Hyur is crude, as always, but Emet-Selch will not be goaded into an argument."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thinking of the words Elidibus would have for him were he here, Emet-Selch remains among the trees long after she departs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" While Lahabrea loved playing the mortal man and Elidibus detests it, Emet-Selch finds himself drawn into the spectacle of mortals’ lives."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I have played these games before, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If you should wish for me to stop -” he croons, pressing nearer to her, “- you need only say ‘Hades’.”  “Hades!” Laughter, shock, and a touch of admonishment colour her voice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “In a classroom, Hades - of all places!”  “You’re beginning to care about me, Hades,” she says, a mischievous glint in her eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is not drawn to her because he wants to corrupt that spirit - he happens to find it just as inspiring as the mortals on the field."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His longtime friend bends down and lifts Hades’s feet off the couch cushion, nimbly sliding into the vacant spot before letting Hades’s heels rest on his thighs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades does not reply - which is answer enough."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “As the new Emet-Selch, I must dedicate myself wholly to the people."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It takes Hades a moment to determine whether he is still breathing; another long, empty silence passes before he finds his voice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “The rope tied round your bedposts is fairly obvious, Hades.”  “Sometimes, Hades, you are a fool."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades glares across the table at his friend."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades makes a face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She knows you, Hades, in ways I am thankful I do not, and that invariably means she knows what you enjoy and what you dislike."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It is a brave question to ask, one not voiced lightly, and Hades hesitates before answering."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What Emet-Selch does is entirely his own business."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades makes a face behind his mask."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades remains a moment longer, Elidibus and the Convocation momentarily forgotten as he watches the woman he loves."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch knows what he is."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Why does Emet-Selch do the same?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch -” The hour is late when Emet-Selch makes his way to the Pendants, his heart heavy and his eyes downcast."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And how did he take Allagan knowledge and twist it to a purpose even Emet-Selch knows not?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though it is a relief to see the man walk away, his words still leave a bitter taste in Emet-Selch’s mouth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You are running, Emet-Selch.” “Emet -“ “Emet-Selch.” In this place he is not Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But he cannot be Hades here, either."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch, you ass!”  “Hades, I presume?”  “Hades.”  “Hades!” Hades is not proud when he presents his idea."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He sits upright on Hades’s couch, staring forward as though made of stone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As much as Hades wants to provide reassurance, he knows there is nothing he can say to render this truth any easier to swallow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looks away, turning his masked face to the opposite wall, but his friend catches his grimace and interprets it correctly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’s mask clatters to the floor as he covers his face with his hands, as sobs tear through his chest, as he finds himself pulled against his friend’s shoulder."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch feels the weight of his guilt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You ask the impossible, Hades.” Misery colours her voice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Farewell, Hades.” Emet-Selch vanishes in a cloud of dark aether, her piercing, desperate eyes the last glimpse of her he sees."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lahabrea’s vitriol splinters Hades’s fog of depression."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch?” Emet-Selch recognizes this, but that is not a path he will allow any of them to walk."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The plan is coming together and he knows Elidibus would be so, so pleased - but Emet-Selch’s world is crumbling around him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Miqo’te has curled into a ball; it would be a pathetic sight if only Emet-Selch’s heart could feel anything ata ll."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You know why, Emet-Selch.” “H - Hades!”  “Hades!”  “I was never alone, Hades.” “This was never about you, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As she tilts her head back and closes her eyes, the inner voice telling Hades to   run, run, run   becomes so much louder."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You do not need to be alone, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch speaks the truth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It is only concern for our brother that motivates us, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch doesn’t give him a chance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He dies before he hits the floor, a hole torn through his entire torso, and if his body hadn’t evaporated into dark aether Emet-Selch would have hit him again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He is equally as likely to waste his time searching for her shattered soul as he is to aid our cause!” Lahabrea spits over Elidibus, the glob of fluid landing just short of Emet-Selch’s boots."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’re a fool, Emet-Selch!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades leaves the trappings of lesser beings behind and claims his true form, slipping into the familiar body as easily he slips on his gloves."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Emet-Selch returns to the Source he finds the star recovering from what the people have taken to calling “Calamities”; they have just endured their third Rejoining and the land is slow to recover."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch shrugs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Emissary has asked for the creation of an empire, a massive request to create technology they will utilize in further calamities, and Emet-Selch knows he is best-suited to this task."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Call me Emet-Selch or call me nothing at all.” He turns away, to the blasted hills beyond - to the land that he must somehow turn from rubble into an empire."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch returns to the First under the guise of helping Mitron, but he takes himself far, far from the lands of people."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the darkest depths of the sea, wrapped in solitude and silence, Emet-Selch sleeps among shades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades.” Entire worlds, Hades - I can’t even comprehend - !” “And us, Hades?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “All or nothing, Hades.” “Hades -” She cuts herself off, purses her lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, on the other hand, knows better."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She appears faded at the edges, somehow, as if her flesh is caught in-between states, but what Emet-Selch can see clearly now is her eyes: snow-white, tainted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch chuckles darkly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Why did you come, if not for knowing this was the end?” Emet-Selch asks her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch softens the grip on her wrists when her head droops again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Silence and stillness gather, and Emet-Selch wonders if the Warrior is asleep."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch says nothing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” she says, and he stops breathing, for he had never told her his name--“Do you love  me?” Emet-Selch is not a man without mercy, nor is he one to forsake his cause."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is alone in his city once more, a wandering shadow in the held breath of its final days."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though why did it feel and sound like Emet-Selch was just communing with an old friend?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch crinkles his brow, and then crosses his arms."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And to the untrained eye, one would likely not notice the subtle shift in Emet-Selch’s countenance nor comportment, as he gazes back at you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Quite suddenly, something firmly grasps onto your hand at your side and it is embarrassing to note how long it takes for you to determine that it is Emet-Selch’s hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch heaves out an exasperated sigh, though promptly stopping to turn and face you in earnest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Okay, Emet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Do not fight Vauthry,” comes the whispered and muffled prayer teetering on command, Emet-Selch’s face virtually buried into your hair and shoulder."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You are brusque and cruel with the movement, though Emet-Selch allows himself to be pushed back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What is this, Emet?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch stands quietly as if in reflection."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The balmy breeze whispers cool along the wet trails on your skin and suddenly Emet-Selch reaches to grasp your hand, cupping it with both of his much larger ones."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch sighs, bringing the silk of his fingers to again graze at your jawline, weaving ever so into the dampened hair at your temple."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" An afterthought buzzes at the back of your mind as you pull away from Emet-Selch; his lips had been so close, and you are sure he was not the only one breaching the breadth of space."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’ll come find you later,” Emet-Selch assures as you turn your gaze back to him, a small smile of ease to his lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch discovers you like this, sprawled out in solitude as you attempt to bite back the racing advent of tears."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch balks at your invitation to sit on the bare ground, a look of horror upon his countenance that could be  nicely  described as overtly melodramatic."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Tell me, Emet.” Stamping down the humility, you turn your head to face the man squarely."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There is a slight tremor in your movements as you turn to fully face Emet-Selch, a notion churning in the pit of your stomach that you are perhaps making a mistake."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch moves a hand to grasp at your wrist, your fingers instantly relaxing from tension under the delicate silk."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A hand pulls from his hair and your fingers begin to fumble at the closure to your tunic, to free your burning skin to Emet-Selch’s attentions."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch cradles your limp form bridal-style, or at least that is what it feels like."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This chapter is dark and is primarily written from Emet-Selch's perspective, while still sticking mostly with 2nd person."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch carries you here, hides and steals your blighted soul away with its shattered stasis."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As a member of the Convocation, the circle of great luminaries who had assented for the grisly offering, Hades found himself dead inside from the undertaking."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus had remained sedate, whereas Lahabrea had remained tenacious—all while Emet-Selch was naught more than a ticking time bomb."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades sat slumped and crumpled at his desk, reclined back with eyes drawn half-closed in fatigue."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The loss had settled deep within Hades’s soul and the contrition for his sins had devoured him into silence."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" More often than not, you both would spend hours like this until you fell asleep under the stars, draped over Hades’s body as a toasty blanket."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades keenly remembered one of the last spats that the two of you had shared."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades, it is a mistake and you know it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades instinctively moves to your side, fingers softly gripping at the back of your hood as the doors to the elevator hum to close."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You must know that...\" Hades whispers, the warmth of his fingers gently cradling along your jaw."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You breathe out heavily, shaking your chin as you feel a damnable tear flow hot down your skin until Hades’s thumb swipes it away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All you can see is him, your lover… your Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades steals the words from your mouth before you can protest, lips capturing yours into a heady, desperate kiss."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A low groan rumbles from your lungs when Hades hoists you aloft with such ease and carries you to the door of your flat, lips never breaking for air for all the fervency."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It slams shut from behind as Hades finds his way to a plush lounge in the parlor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your flesh is on fire, Hades slipping his fingers under the seam of the now sweltering robes to palm at your heaving breasts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But just ere you allow yourself to sober with such thoughts, Hades laves his tongue over a pebbled nipple whilst pinching at the other."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades kneels on the floor before your panting form resting wanton upon the lounge."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watches you so swiftly tumble down all around him, a trembling mess under his mouth as his hands grasp and massage along your thighs, now straddled over his shoulders."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The tiniest notion of hesitation blooms at the pit of your stomach as Hades scoops you into his arms, though that melts to adrenaline under his lips as he begins kissing you softly, then more deeply, carrying you to the bedroom to lay you down on the large bed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades cannot stifle the hitch in his throat as you work your hips into him, then moving a hand to stroke over his shaft."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A growl resonates from Hades’s breath as you rut against him particularly slow and teasing, his fingers moving to splay at your back to push you down firm against him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades breaks away after a long moment to bend your legs back and stroke his length into you thorough, merciless and painstakingly slow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the aftermath, you lie along the mussed sheets, curled in Hades’s arms and you wish it to never end."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That was the last time Hades would see you before the Summoning."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades pressed his thumb and forefinger to the bridge of his nose, a terrible migraine bleeding at the brain."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Just before the day of the Summoning, Hades had become utterly unhinged by the idea of any harm coming to you, hysterically begging Hythlodaeus to tell him where his former lover was."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For whatever reason, the thought of it stirred extreme disquiet with Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Now Hades sat alone and smothered with endless questions."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades slowly rose from the chair, muscles and bones creaking as an old man’s."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I have always loved you, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades… “Hades…” As your pupils focus under the faint glow of the space you find yourself in, you pull away and—without much thought but with much vigour—rise to straddle Emet-Selch at the waist."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And there is this matter of unspoken deliverance, that he—the Ascian and Paragon Emet-Selch—is now your savior."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades.” Emet-Selch licks his lips slow, then presses them to yours in a kiss more soft than the others."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades…” The hands at your waist draw tight, Emet-Selch pulling over your body and pressing his forehead to yours."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A wisp of shadowed aether twirls at the periphery and Emet-Selch chases away, no goodbyes offered other than a lone kiss pressed to your knuckle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ...Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" did Hades...?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Some added flesh to the story, written from Emet-Selch's perspective."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A long life that should have not felt so for Emet-Selch, for he had lived a thousand thousand lifetimes and this one should have felt like all the rest—a small fleck of paint to the sweeping canvas."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch had been intricately involved in the schema and workings of the Rejoinings—from helping the civilization of Allag to prosper only to tear it down with the Fourth Ardor, to building the Garlean Empire as a world power and thus fermenting the groundwork that had already been laid for the Seventh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though this was a trait that had carried on with Emet-Selch for as long as Elidibus and Lahabrea could remember, to the days of Amaurot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This is the stance that Elidibus had adopted by the time the Allagan Empire had been prospering, when Emet-Selch was funneling his energies into Emperor Xande."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Many years later and with great foresight, Emet-Selch had been able to set the wheels in motion for not one but two calamities."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was during this time of the umbral era when their work had brought the star five times rejoined, that Emet-Selch had receded ever so much within himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" LIttle did either know, this was when Emet-Selch first caught a glimpse of you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades.” Emet-Selch was reeling on the inside, just as he heard a man’s voice bellow out in the distance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For an unknowable stretch of time, Emet-Selch had gone astray after this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s absence thus stirred the attention and concern of the Emissary, for the petty arguments could have been avoided altogether had he not vanished as was his wont."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Quickly, Emet-Selch shrugged and deflected."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If I receive no word, then I shall return when I deem it worthy of my time.” Emet-Selch said this with dryness lacing through his tone, a fist slowly clenching at his side before tucking it beneath crossed arms."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" While he was no stranger to loss—no, they all had to carve out things which were dear to them—the strain of it had always dragged Hades at the heel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Whether to solidly prove a point or because he had grown weary from not getting his hands dirty enough during the Third Astral Era, Emet-Selch thrust himself wholly into the forefront of the effort for the Sixth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As Solus, Emet-Selch never once left his vessel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch, full at his prime as Solus, treaded deeper with heavy footfall into the space where you were fettered to a steel stake, wrists gathered behind at the hip."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That day, Emet-Selch was reminded of how truly ephemeral a sundered life could be."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Over the span of his life as Solus, Emet-Selch would know more pain than happiness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But of course Emet-Selch knew that his rest would not be  eternal, though he’d had the mind it would in the least have endured longer than a paltry handful of years."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So Emet-Selch followed the hero to the First, without a word to Elidibus of his whereabouts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All that he—all that Hades wanted in that moment was to save you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I was very nearly tempted to play around with the theory that Emet-Selch was Xande, or at least his clone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch—nay,  Hades  meets your wary gaze as he lies beside you, the same plain black robes from before pooled upon the bedding in oddly refined fashion."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I had the mind to lock you in your room and throw away the key at your act of foolishness, Hades purrs while still attempting to dry the tears."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Help me to remember, Hades.” Hades pulls from your lips, hot breath falling down the slope of your neck as he still clutches you to him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades…\" Dark aether ghosts over your body, running cool along its heat as Hades runs open mouthed kisses to the low valley of your sternum, his hand releasing from your hair to grasp at your backside."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If only you knew how long I’ve waited to put my mouth on you, my dearest,” Hades croons quietly into your pebbled flesh, alternating between laving his tongue mellow and scraping his teeth wicked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Large hands grasp into your waist, your body slipping down steady against Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The more you closely you peer into Hades, the more you realise that the vibrant hue is not simply suffused with his aether... that it is  not  his aether you are seeing at all as it bleeds forth like blood from somewhere endless within."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’s voice is more of a plea than aught else, and you have those godsdamned tears pricking behind your lids again to the look he is giving you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I have dreamt of you, Hades.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades says something after breaking away, when—like a fool—your mouth drifts to follow, to taste him once more for you could never get enough."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then Hades takes a steady stride towards a dark corner of the room, into the shadows and you cannot see but only trust your gut that he is chasing you off into a portal."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Something brushes down the side of your hand and you turn your head to see Hades standing beside you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then you are the one to breach the distance, looping your arms around Hades’s neck to kiss him like something snagged out of a romance novella from Tataru’s private stash."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For one long moment, when you first hold Hades’s hand and begin to take your first steps beside him in the dreary allure of the city, the thought slowly sinks in that there had never really been a difference between your dreams or memories at all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You know that as your hand clings more tightly to Hades, tensed and small fingers bending through his much longer ones, that you could not hope to stand on your own two feet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With skin scalding and ankles trembling from above tipped toes, you part your lips from Hades and try to recall how to breathe."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You can practically feel the crooked smirk spreading over Hades’s mouth from just over your nose."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your mind scrambles in the gutter to decide exactly what “sort of favour” Hades could offer, when a token of caprice strikes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watches on with intrigue as you raise your eyes to meet his from over your shoulder, lips curling into a simper."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your gait is purposeful and your grip around his hand is firm, dragging Hades along just as sure as you drag the deep laughter from his lungs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Come on, Hades!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades explains that the stature of the ancients had been on a different scale before the sundering, towering to your perspective."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades seems to regress ever so beside you, motionless with shoulders slumped and voice threadbare as he speaks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It is a question that slips absentmindedly from your lips as Hades walks you beside a building that he has explained as a school of sorts, the Akadaemia Anyder."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades lifts the hand he is holding, thumb brushing across your knuckles in a gesture that makes your eyes burn."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades begins tracing his forefinger along the many ugly marks on the back of your hand, and it grounds you solid as he continues."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades meets your careful regard with intent."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your voice echoes barely amid the vast stretch of space, chin turning over your shoulder to behold Hades standing still at the threshold and a good distance afar."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What else have you done, Hades?” you whisper, hands reaching upward to pass over and rest along his smooth ashen skin, over the curve of his jaw."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At that moment, as your brain processes what he has said, your hands fall away from Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades appears too calm as he continues, which makes him appear all the more far gone and disjointed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Seven hells, Hades…” There is no thought of stopping Hades as he unhurriedly unties and works the garment off of your body."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Tell me, Hades.” It hushes from your breath as you feel his lips press against the bare skin along the curve of your shoulder."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stills the hands that have been searching over your stomach and hips, covered by little more than a strip of thin cloth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So something inside both breaks and clicks into place when Hades opens his mouth, quiet and crippling to your limbs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You lurch forward and can hear Hades’s muted voice from behind, though it is impossible to decipher what is said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades grasps you powerfully around the waist and the distress feeding off from him is made plain by how tense he feels against you, in both flesh and something else you only now have the presence of mind to wrestle—something about his aether."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With the greatest of efforts do you try to ignore the stark heat you feel under your skin, fingernails cutting fiercely into Hades’s arms as your mind is hunting—scouring to spark the synapses and seize those memories back, flashed radiant like jewels."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Still, Hades answers with your name, lips shaping the sound into the nape of your neck, and it feels right, so very ordinary to hear him speak it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I need you, Seph...” Hades tells you, quiet and shed of all pretense."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Please, Hades...” Hades studies your lips as the words rush out unbidden."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades urges you to relax, bids you to breathe and take your time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As you look back up at Hades, you may as well be a virgin under his crushing scrutiny."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A chill drifts in between, just as fingers coil around the back of your calve and Hades pulls you close, easing into you with unhurried motion."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “My, my... You are shaking like a leaf.” Hades states this with a hint of a predatory smirk, made crooked as he leans his head down to your navel to lazily run his wet tongue over a stray mole that resides just north."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And with how thin your resolve has become, you meet Hades halfway—teeth snagging at his pout before gathering him into a heated kiss."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To your considerable surprise, Hades allows you as much."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So you roll your hips into Hades as you roll your tongue over his, and drag your dampened apex over stiffened flesh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The smile Hades returns is staggering, something beyond compare and corrupt all the same."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades does just that, and with such reverence to make your heart rise to your throat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not seen but felt so visceral as it pushes you back and threads into the webbing like hands pinning you back, all while Hades works his hot mouth down your heaving sternum."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Casting your heavy eyes downward, they are swift to lock onto the scene below—the subtle, depraved grin Hades offers while his large hands drift up to cup and grasp over your breasts in full, watching with fixation as you throw your neck back when his thumbs  push and flick hard over pert peaks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ah, so  very  ready for me and I’ve barely touched...” Hades purrs while ghosting his mouth over your flushed skin, dipping his tongue to swirl around a pebbled nipple before wrapping lush lips to suck very slow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades spends long moments pressing honeyed whispers of praise and worship into your flesh, how perfect you are—your soul so exquisite and heaven incarnate—in his hands  at last."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your breathing grows shallow and uneven while Hades leans his face close, so very close to your sex, bound by sodden and sheer material."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades pulls his tongue flat over the fabric, dragging it from the drenched area at your center and spanning upward to the budding of nerves swollen from neglect."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Gods, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your knees inadvertently attempt to shut tight as your back bows to the sensation, choking on air and jerking your shoulders at the bindings when Hades circles his lips along that bud and suckles slowly, with such leisure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If his mouth on you is not enough, Hades sends his aether to run over your sweating skin—stroking and brushing along your breasts, stomach, and backside."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades must agree with you, as something churns in the space between just before he snaps a finger, leaving your bare skin chilled for a split second before wet heat swells at your sex in full and its intensity shreds a loud cry from you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades lets one hand fall down your inner thigh, the smooth bed of his dull nails sweeping down supple skin to carefully knead along the muscle at the juncture of your sex."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Damn it,  please  Hades!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades parts his mouth open with heated interest and, for how willing you are, it is naught for him to add two more to join the other—watching you cry and break under the feel of him, the sweet stretch he spreads."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It is impossible for your hips not to meet Hades in the middle with every bend and pump of his hand, throwing your head back and rutting against him unrestrained."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It is passing strange how your fingers ended up sifting into his silky tresses, body curled close from underneath and cooing plush words of admiration to Hades whilst hitting your first of many highs under his skilled care."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your soul is the most enchanting thing I have ever laid eyes on,” Hades rasps onto burning skin, grasping your waist and roughly dragging you against the smooth, dampened silk to pin you beneath him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your legs spread more wide from under him and, with little preamble and as if your bodies had twined like such for so many times before, Hades drives his cock slow and with ease inside of you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You’d already forgotten what had been said just the moment before when Hades pulls from your lips as he pulls from your sex, leaving you nigh empty until steadily pressing back into you as he regales you with pretty words etched in longing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades leans in to kiss you softly for a long moment, driving himself deep inside of you to where your nails draw blood from his back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades links a hold at your wrist and moves to pull you back into his arms, but your other hand stays him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Tell me, Hades.” Your fingers tangle with his as you rock your weight into him, pivoting your pelvis just so and leaning back to where he hits the mark."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I wish you could see it...” Hades breathes, his voice then swaying into a sweet song of yore."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your nails cut and claw into Hades as he wraps his arms around, pressing you into his skin and whispering into your lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet as if to fool himself and make you forget, Hades takes your mouth to his with a crippling impatience—sharing in your unsteady breath before his tongue bends to steal it back again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades never replies to your long forgotten question, seemingly adrift in the moment as everything about his demeanor becomes more unhinged—a deep yearning to the way that he brings you into a kiss that flirts with fierce desperation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’s breath is just as shaken, if not moreso as he haltingly dips his mouth from yours and, for the longest time, he simply rests his damp forehead against your brow with hands nestled into your hair, now in repose but unwilling to let go."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades first grasps your hips with little effort to lift you aloft and then seats you down deliciously swift onto his cock, thick and impossibly hard with your loud shriek."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades, I’m going to… I can’t—” Before you can gather your wits, you are pressing Hades down below you with a forceful purpose."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There is a change in you, uncut and brought to life as it crawls under your skin, swims through your veins and you think that Hades must feel this too."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades lies reverent and rapt underneath you, and the wish seethes itself through your heart that you had not played pretend for so long."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And as your Ascian, Emet-Selch—Hades clutches fast onto the pliant flesh of your throat, clamps forefinger and thumb like steel to the crux of jawbone, dragging your face down to meet his in the faintest slip of a kiss—you fear you do not care as you should, about whatever lies outside of these walls, the bloodied fray on the other side of the dream, those protean variables you could never quite grasp to begin with."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades!” So you do not listen, ever so determined to meet Hades somewhere in the middle, even as his gnarled soul pours into you and splits you from the inside out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades shoves away violently, knocking you back as a parallel between both soul and flesh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It is unknown as to when you were driven upward, braced on bent knees before Hades along the mussed maze of sheets."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We are going to have to do something about all of this weeping, my love,” Hades says with a tender brush of heat over your skin, whilst lying you carefully down into the misshapen sheets below."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your unfinished question hangs in the honeyed air while Hades runs his tongue down your chest, pausing his descent to suckle and tease at the stiffening tips of your breasts, worrying at far too sensitive flesh between perfect teeth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The room has all but fallen into an asylum of opulent bloom and greenery by the time that Hades has crawled up your body, lain across an altar of lilac and creamy jasmine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There is no doubt in your voice, and Hades pulls from you, canting his disconcerted gaze up to meet yours just when next you say, “You   are mine.” Otherwise, I do not feel that Hades could have reached out like he did in-game without repercussions."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, Emet-Selch, Architect, Ascian, Paragon of the Source, Bringer of Chaos and Summoner of Zodiark, groaned in pain."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades approached the vanity, and looked himself over more closely."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had expected to be ended - but he yet lived, and he was not being tortured, or humiliated, or any other gruesome options that sprang to his mind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Aah, You’re awake,” A masculine voice said, and Hades turned to see a tall Elezen man standing in the doorway."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Who is the Mistress?” Hades asked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She is currently ensconced with some of her compatriots, most notably Lady Krile Mayer Baldesion, in Mor Dhona, discussing the issue.” Hades decided this servant was unusually forthcoming, and he wasn’t sure if he liked that or not."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Olivier’s reply was not immediate, Hades set his jaw."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Music soothes me,” Hades said, and attempted to smile innocently."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “As you like,” He closed the door, and Hades heard a definitive click as it locked behind him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch was served two meals - a moderate breakfast and a light lunch - before he was informed that the “Mistress” had returned, just as the light from his impenetrable windows was shifting towards orange."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades gave Olivier a sly grin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As the servant shut the door, Hades, Emet-Selch, Architect, Ascian, Paragon of the Source, Bringer of Chaos and Summoner of Zodiark, shivered in delight at the idea of the (R\/N) selecting what he would wear in his subjugation, and he wasn’t sure why."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" (Y\/N) joins Emet-Selch for dinner."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The click in the lock was the only warning Hades received before (Y\/N) swept into the room, her face unreadable, the household servants trailing in her wake."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After five full minutes had passed without a flicker of movement, Emet-Selch sighed in irritation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As Hades settled into his own seat, the servants placed covered dishes before them, and poured a touch of wine into (Y\/N)’s glass."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When she said, “It’s excellent, thank you,” to the servant, Hades realized he’d been holding his breath."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He only wished he were surprised to see the delicate hors d’oeuvres, but at this point, Hades knew she was going to make him suffer the entire seventeen courses."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades didn’t permit himself to speak, not until both gloves were resting in her lap, under her napkin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Is he your lover?” Emet-Selch asked, then cursed inwardly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was no fool - that had been indecent, inflaming, and absolutely intentional."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” he said, taking up his own glass of wine, draining it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Very well, Hades,” (Y\/N) replied, taking another sip of her wine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She gave the man an appreciative nod, and Hades let his eyes sweep over the curve of her jaw before she turned back to him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Several,” Hades replied, and took up his wine glass again, taking a more measured sip."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “No,” Hades said, running a hand through his hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “So, do you have other questions?” she continued, “Or are you going to sit through this whole meal and just give me brooding, hungry looks?” The (R\/N) woman lifted a spoonful of the consommé that Hades had completely forgotten to her mouth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I have a use for you,” (Y\/N) answered enigmatically, and though it did not give him the direction Hades was hoping for, it at least spared him the end of that disastrous train of thought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades leaned back in his chair and huffed, the breath of it stirring the hair that hung over his face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades said nothing, staring at the dish as if it had offended him and recalculating his position."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “No one here will hurt you, Hades,” she said, softly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades wanted to scream, to terrify her, to beat her to death with one of these hand-carved chairs, or tear the dress from her and have her right there on the floor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Will they?” Hades queried, looking up into her eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades laughed, near hysterical."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Would you like to dance, Lady (L\/N)?” Hades asked abruptly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ergo, if Hades was going to return to his ascendance, return to being Emet-Selch, he needed her cooperation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For now, Hades continued to dance, letting the Orchestrion play without interruption - twirling her about the small room while his mind catalogued her every reaction."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Like any other Empire - drunk on dreams of glory and conquest and military honor,” Hades said, off-handedly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though he could not see her face, he could see her shoulders and a wide expanse of her back, and Hades bit his lip at the sight of gooseflesh spreading along her skin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades yearned to tell (Y\/N) exactly what she could do, on her knees or on her back, but he wasn’t ready to end the game so quickly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades laughed and placed both hands on her waist, lifting her up and turning before setting her down again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Anyway…” Hades demurred, continuing the dance as if she hadn’t almost frozen in his arms, “I was hoping I might prevail upon you to allow me access to your library as well?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Thank you,” Hades let his lips brush the shell of her ear as he spoke, and she froze again, and wrenched herself from his grasp."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades paid him no mind, just meandered over to the table and took up her glass of wine, taking a moment to enjoy it, along with the flavor of her lips on the rim."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades sensed something, and turned to find Elidibus leaning against the Orchestrion."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What’s wrong?” Emet-Selch asked, giving Elidibus a playful pout."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh thank Zodiark,” Hades replied, reaching for it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Mixing business and pleasure,” Hades laughed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Spoilsport,” Hades grumbled, then stretched out on the bed, letting himself drift to sleep with thoughts of the Warrior of Light and all the ways to find himself between her thighs - as well as all the advantage he could find there - dancing through his head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades heads to the Library, then joins (Y\/N) for dinner."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Hades awoke again, the table and chairs were gone, but a few new things had arrived."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She wants me, Hades mused, but she doesn’t want anyone to know."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ”Please me,” Hades remembered (Y\/N) saying."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The entire walk to the library, Hades was observing and cataloguing everything."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The first thing Hades noticed was that there were too many books for such a small space."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her personal collection had to go somewhere.” He looked about the room, then let his gaze settle on Hades in disapproval."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As Olivier shut the door behind him, Hades had to admit a level of surprise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades pushed the rest of the books to the floor, and lifted his prize to the light."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades wondered idly which camp (Y\/N) fell into as he opened the book to the marked page."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Chewing his lip, Hades leaned against the desk and looked into the fireplace, letting the dancing flames distract his vision while he considered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By the time evening came around, Hades was irritable, hungry, and eager to talk."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades would have to first convince her that he had no intentions of using her that way, then ask for her help with something small in what appeared to be a moment of vulnerability."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The books tucked under his arm, Hades gave an affable wave."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Mistress is doing so herself at the moment.” Without further explanation, he turned, leading Hades out of the library and back to his rooms."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You mentioned I have limited run of the manor this morning,” Hades said cheerfully, “How would I go about that?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades smirked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Of course,” Hades said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And Zodiark… Hades thought, as (Y\/N) swept into the room in another evening gown, this one of burgundy velvet, do I want to touch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades chuckled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You should eat, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades, if all it takes is a locked door to stop you from getting what you want, you’re not the man I thought you were.” Hades gripped her upper arm, and levered himself out of his chair, catching the droplet on his tongue then slipping it into her open mouth, crushing her lips with his own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades and (Y\/N) have a long talk, and she asks for a favor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades felt Olivier’s hands grip him - Zodiark, he is unusually strong, - and tear him away from (Y\/N), who raised a hand to her mouth in shock as he was pulled across the room, and set on his feet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Shame, not disgust, Hades reminded himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was surprised at the honesty."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Still,” he said, straightening, “I have not treated you in the manner etiquette demands, and for that you have my humblest apologies.” Hades let his eyes return to her, finally, and their gazes met, then he looked down again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I suggest you leave before I become cross.” Her tone was commanding, and Hades relished every moment of it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Olivier moved away, and Hades finally let himself look at (Y\/N) when the door closed behind the Elezen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Are you a coward, Hades?” (Y\/N) asked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades laughed quietly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “The other Ascians,” Hades said, taking a step toward her, letting his fingers meet hers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’d really rather not,” Hades countered as they began to dance, all thoughts of food forgotten."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They danced in silence, enjoying each other and the music for a time, before Hades spoke again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Considering where it was in the book it was in,” Hades replied, pushing her back from him a step, before pulling her close with a spin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’ brow furrowed and he frowned."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" (Y\/N) nodded, but said nothing, so Hades continued."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I just - I finally understand the situation,” Hades said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades followed (Y\/N) through the halls, his hand clutched in hers, past his bedroom door, and up to the top of the staircase, which ended in a door."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’re too precious for him,” Hades said, without hesitation or guile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades took the letters and leaned against the desk beside her, looking them over."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Whistling appreciatively, Hades looked through the letters again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades makes his moves while (Y\/N) sleeps."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades took the first one that had been written in Zenos’ personal hand, not that of a secretary, and read it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades laughed at himself, feeling so possessive over something as innocuous as her name, but it did not change his desire - he wanted the right to call her by her name, to call her (Y\/N), stripped of all formality, to be his and his alone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades grinned, and began to laugh maniacally, the unexpected answer falling into place around him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As Emet-Selch, Hades, The Architect, Paragon of the Source, he had no power."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “While I’m aware, and thank you for the assistance, there’s a task that only you can see done at the moment.” Hades offered up the letter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ”Lady (L\/N),” Hades snapped the correction before he could stop himself, then coughed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You’re still just as fiercely possessive of her.” Hades said nothing, so Elidibus continued, “I will take your letter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Good luck on your courtship, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades scowled and turned, kicking the leg of the desk, then shook away his anger."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades found pen and ink and paper in her desk, but was forced to carry a chair and small table to her bedside."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The night air felt lovely on his skin, and Hades closed his eyes, inhaling the desert breeze."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When it landed harmlessly amongst the bushes, Hades laughed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A few hours later, as dawn approached, Hades put the finishing touches on his handiwork."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a last wistful sigh, Hades stepped back into the room, only to freeze."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades only made one stop on his way out of the room, and that was to press his lips to (Y\/N)’s temple before returning to his bedchamber."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was immensely skilled at art, and she felt something… strange, at the thought that he had chosen to draw her, of anything."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades and Sadayo deal with Zenos's response."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I don’t care!” Olivier’s sharp yell woke Hades with a start."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades listened to what he could as he pulled a fresh change of clothes from the armoire."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There was no other Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades pondered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “(Y\/N)!” At the Elezen’s echoing cry, Hades slammed the Armoire shut and buckled his belt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades found the door was locked, but jerked it open anyway, tiny steel screws and the lock plate skittering across the floor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’re not worth the theater of it,” Hades snarled, and abruptly turned to (Y\/N)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I told you to keep it down.” When her eyes returned to Hades, he bit the inside of his cheek to keep from commenting on the red-rims around her eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Without looking up, Hades backhanded Olivier across the cheek, savoring the sweet release the strike brought him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For now ensure that the staff are prepared for the extra burden, and put plans in train for a formal welcoming luncheon.” (Y\/N) looked up at Hades, and something flickered in the back of her eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I can be,” Hades interrupted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I have a chaise lounge you can sleep on, if you really wish to be in my rooms, but you have not earned a place in my bed, yet.” Still, she laughed, and Hades considered that a victory."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Olivier rolled his eyes and stormed out of the room, leaving them alone, and Hades took her hand, pulling (Y\/N) to her feet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The space between them, bridged only by their hands, felt awkward and unwelcome, but Hades did not want to push too much too quickly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Why did you pick the Goblet, of all places, my dear?” Hades asked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Eorzea has its charms,” Hades said, and he grinned inwardly as she realized what charm he was talking about, “but I fear you were made for greater things than squabbling city-states.” “As you wish, my lady.” Hades let his hand fall between them, covering hers, and told her all about his empire."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades froze and began calculating."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades paused, giving thought to the question, and realized she was right."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He went on about how he was finally feeling something…” She swallowed, “And then he lifted his sword to his throat, said goodbye to me, and committed suicide.” Though she was not looking at him, Hades could see the haunted echoes in her eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades clenched his jaw, but the memory came upon him unbidden."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hydaelyn’s strike sent a hail of pale blue bolts down upon the population, shattering them, in a great wave of unmaking that seemed to rush towards Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I should not have…” Hades trailed off when he realized she hadn’t pulled away, so he returned his hands to her back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I am here to serve you, in whatever capacity is necessary.” His eyes slipped to Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I want to spend an evening with you the way you like - the way you spent your evenings before I was here.” Hades gave into the urge to brush her hair out of her face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A clock in the hall chimed seven times as Hades found himself climbing the stairs to (Y\/N)’s bedchamber."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You don’t want him.” Hades ran his gloved fingers down her spine where it was revealed by her gown."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I know,” Hades chuckled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I don’t recall submitting to you, at all, Hades.” She was trying to sound hard, but her voice shook, and he chuckled darkly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Hades finally let go, he was pleased to see her skin darkening quickly, a sign of an oncoming bruise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I will not allow any other outcome, whatever charade you insist on.” Hades lifted one hand, turning her head to face him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I will take what is mine, (Y\/N).” Hades stepped back and straightened himself, then offered his arm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You asked me, earlier, if I had ever seen someone take their own life in front of me.” Hades said, softly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades tightened his grip on (Y\/N)’s hand, and she tightened hers in response."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They sat in silence for a long time, neither of them saying anything, but Hades could feel her eyes on him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades and (Y\/N) spend the night together."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" (Y\/N) stared at Hades, and her mouth opened as if she was going to say something, but then she pulled her hand from his, and stood."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The sight made Hades draw in a sharp breath."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades kissed her, holding her by her head, and her fists twisting against his shoulders."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I can stay the night without riding you, if you wish.” Hades laughed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Would you prefer I left while you changed into your nightclothes, and returned in mine, or shall I sleep in my underthings?” Hades leaned toward her ear, and murmured, “Or I can sleep nude, to help you get used to what things will be like in our marriage bed.” Seeing them, Hades chuckled, and tugged the bottom of her chemise up so that he could run a finger along the lace and ribbons at the top of her thighs, so near the heaven he yearned for."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gripping the chemise in his hand, Hades pulled it off over her head in a single quick jerk."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades, I-” She began, but he placed a finger on her lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “H-Hades…” her voice was trembling as much as she was."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You may have bested me on the First, but that was when I thought I could not have you.” Hades dipped his head, catching her earlobe in his teeth and giving it a gentle tug."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You are still a mortal woman, and for all that you and Hydaelyn conspired to sunder me, I am still Emet-Selch of the Convocation of Fourteen.” His mouth moved to her sternum, kissing between her breasts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You have staved off a Calamity and caught an Ascian - not just any Ascian, but Emet-Selch, the Architect - in your snare."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I told you, (Y\/N), I take very good care of my things.” Hades slid a finger inside her, and she cried out - louder when he added a second finger."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” her voice was barely a whisper, a plea, raw and desperate for release."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I cannot wait to fuck you.” Hades left little kisses along her hairline, then brought his fingers to his lips, reveling in the taste of her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades found he enjoyed this dichotomy as much as the others."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades released her and climbed out of bed, heading for her vanity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could only imagine the pleasure he would find there, and he did so, greedily, clutching her in his arms and thrusting into her tight grip."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “(Y\/N)...” Hades gasped, as all his petty insecurities began to melt away beneath her fingers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, called Emet-Selch, The Architect, Ascian, Paragon of the Source, Solus zos Galvus, Emperor of Garlemald fell asleep like that, clutching the Warrior of Light to his chest in the quiet stillness of a desert night, far from all the problems of the day."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades woke to the sound of movement, and opened one eye."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Tea sounds lovely,” Hades said firmly from the bed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Why?” Hades stroked her arm gently with his fingers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To his surprise, Hades felt anger."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I’m more likely to wake you and tell you where I’m going than leave without a word.” Hades laughed at himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Truth be told, I am just as much yours as you are mine, much as it shames me.” (Y\/N) nodded, softly, and Hades cradled her close until the maids returned, and said that her bath was ready."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was leaning back in a bath in his room, staring up at the ceiling, when Elidibus appeared."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Finally,” the Emissary huffed, and tossed a drowsing infant towards Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Three left.” Hades raised an eyebrow at Elidibus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Good,” Hades grit his teeth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “How are you crossing the rift with mortals?” Hades asked, focusing on the other Ascian, who merely grinned."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades leaned his head against his hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As he vanished in a swirl of void aether, Hades thought, Too late for that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Together, (Y\/N) and Hades spent the day helping to prepare for Zenos’s arrival."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her staff adored her, and she pitched in just as much with the chores - despite Hades’s many attempted interruptions."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Get some sleep, (Y\/N),” Hades whispered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades woke to find a sheet pulled over him, and (Y\/N) seated on the side of the bed, wrapped in a robe of silk and lace, her shoulders shaking."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades felt his mood darken considerably."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Nor will I,” Hades growled out, slinking from the shadows to pull (Y\/N) back into the bed with him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The moment the door clicked shut, Hades was tugging the robe open."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I didn’t want to wake you, and Olivier came in to ask which armor I wanted prepared…” She reached for Hades, tentatively, and he caught her hand and pulled her close."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I don’t want other men touching you in our bedchamber.” Hades’s voice was hard."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That’s my name, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Eventually you will select your Ascian titles, like I use Emet-Selch and the Architect, while my real name is -” Zodiark, I had not planned to have this out this soon, Hades thought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You are entitled to your own identity amongst them.” Hades offered her a small smile, but the emotion had bled out of her face, returning to the impassive mask she had used at the beginning."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I will not be an Ascian.” Her voice was measured and calm, and Hades found he hated not being able to read her emotions."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Let me go, Hades.” Hades’s set his jaw."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was surprised to feel a strange tension leave him as well, at her acceptance of the unknown."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades lurked in the stairwell of the manor, straightening his fur-lined coat in front of a large, gilt-edge mirror."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I know,” Hades said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades found (Y\/N) a few minutes later, a linkpearl pressed into her ear in the library."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades said nothing, just crossed to her, sliding one arm about her waist, the other gripping the mantle of the fireplace while he pressed his lips to hers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “(Y\/N), he’s been here an hour and already he tries my patience.” Hades slid his now bare hand to her neck, unbuttoning the high collar that hid the way he’d marked her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Changed back?” Hades pondered over the words, then laughed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stood, tucking the key into the inner pocket of his vest, then snatched his glove off the floor, pulling it back on as he leaned against a bookcase."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For a moment, Solus could almost hear her say, “Hades’s bed,” and he nearly snorted the wine, but thankfully, when she actually spoke, she demurred."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How far will you go, Hades?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades awoke to Elidibus sitting beside his bed, eating the rest of his dinner."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What?” Hades asked, rubbing his head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Shouldn’t you be killing me?” Hades said, pulling himself up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Who hasn’t?” He pulled out another infant, and dumped it on Hades’s lap."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Why?” Hades asked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a pained sigh, Hades absorbed the child."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’ll see you tomorrow, then?” Hades teased."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Take your time.” Hades knew the truth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the hall, Hades passed Olivier."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “For now,” Hades admitted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" (Y\/N) woke as Hades was unlacing her bodice, trying to undress her gently."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades, are you all right?” she asked, her voice thick with sleep."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” she said, her voice a delicate purr, and he spread apart his fingers and opened one eye to see her push the lace tops down slowly, watching him for his reaction."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’re not even trying to be subtle,” Hades accused."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You are mine, (Y\/N).” Hades pulled her close for a kiss, then wriggled out of his own clothes, leaving them in a pile beside the bed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades makes his confession."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The sound of summer cicadas woke Hades, and he opened his eyes to see broad shafts of sunlight coming in through the balcony doors, catching the delicate fibers of (Y\/N)’s sheer bed curtains."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I wish it could stay like this,” Hades whispered to his sleeping (Y\/N)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He let himself doze a while longer, content to be beside her, and soon enough she began to stir, her pulse and breath quickening just slightly, and Hades opened his eyes just in time to watch hers flutter open and glance about, before settling on him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’m all right,” Hades chuckled, and stroked her wrist with his thumb."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’ll do as I like,” Hades said playfully, and wrapped his free arm around her, placing his hand between her shoulder blades and pulling her close for a kiss."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” she whispered, and something in her voice caught on his heart, and he turned all his attention to her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades pulled her closer, bringing his arm out from beneath the pillow to hug her to his chest, and buried his face in the curve of her neck."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’re wrong,” Hades growled against her skin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I was considering finding a way to leave Zodiark’s service, for you.” Hades hissed as sharp pain split his skull."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” she whispered, “It’s all right."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “One day at a time, then.” She shifted her hips, slightly, and Hades groaned when he felt how wet she was with the tip of his cock."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I…” Hades leaned closer, brushing the tip of his nose along her cheekbone in intimacy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” Zodiark, he thought, I will never get tired of hearing my name from her lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades held out as long as he could, but his body was screaming for (Y\/N), yearning to tear her apart, to consume her body and soul, so she could never be free of him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades moved back over her and pushed his way back inside, delighted to find her deliciously wet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades and (Y\/N) spend time together, and receive an unexpected visit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades woke again as maids were moving quietly through the room, setting out a small luncheon for two on the balcony."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Shaking his head, Hades said, “No, thank you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades thought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Once the maids had departed, Hades slid out of the bed and wandered over to the chessboard, reviewing the moves both he and (Y\/N) had made over the last few days - her pawn, from f2 to f3, his from b7 to b5; her knight from g1 to e2, his from b8 to d7."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades begrudgingly moved a pawn from e7 to e5."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades castled his own king and rook."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’ll do that anyway, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Marry me,” Hades said, snatching up (Y\/N)’s hand and pulling it to his lips as they sat together on her balcony, eating their lunch much later than originally planned."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades followed her, watching silently as she removed her light silk robe and began digging through her armoire."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Can you call one of my maids, Hades?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Zodiark, Hades laughed internally."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “How, specifically, do you want me to help?” Hades asked, leaning against one of her bedposts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Zodiark, Hades thought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Lady (Y\/N) (L\/N), ward of House Fortemps,” he announced smoothly, then bowed, and (Y\/N) entered the room, leaving Hades to follow in her wake."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" (Y\/N) smiled widely, truly, genuinely, and Hades huffed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You don’t have to talk about me like I’m not here,” Hades complained, sulkily, from the doorway, before moving further into the room and taking a seat at the low piano bench."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That skeleton crew in Mor Dhona hardly constitutes the Scions, and further, I have made myself quite clear - Not only is the Ascian, Emet-Selch, to remain unharmed, but I have extended my protection to him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades and (Y\/N) talk Hades exhaled, and turned to face the piano."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Raising an eyebrow, Hades shook it, two fingers in her tiny palm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Are you going to play, Emet-Selch?” she asked, looking hopefully at the piano."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Olivier contacted (Y\/N), and I remember, she stood up in the middle of the meeting, and said, ‘If any one of you harms the Ascian, then I will bring about the Calamity myself.’ Then her nose started bleeding and she ran from the room.” Tataru giggled, but Hades’s eyes had snapped to (Y\/N), to her straight back, the way her feet had slid into a duelist’s stance, even though she bore no weapon - and the way she had interposed herself between him and her opponent."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “W-what?” Hades’s attention was torn from her again, and returned to Tataru."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades smiled at the Lalafell, genuinely."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I’m afraid (Y\/N) likes me, and she might have a problem if you didn’t.” She sighed and shook her head, and Hades paused."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades continued to play, focusing on the keys, the touch of his gloved hands as soft as the song itself, and he did not look at her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades licked his lips a moment, and inhaled slowly, to steady himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades remembered the first time, long ago, he had kissed her - soft and unexpected and instinctual, two drops of water slipping together on that sunlit morning, outside the Hall of Rhetoric."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Zenos,” Hades offered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had always envisioned those ancient primals as enemies, sworn to destroy each other, but in that moment, he saw a deeper truth writ large: They were lovers, caught in the same all-consuming destructive dance that he and (Y\/N) were."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades made love to her gently, too."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As the idyll of their moment in the salon passed, Hades felt the violence rising in him again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades left the cherry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" On the advice of Olivier and Tataru, Hades takes (Y\/N) on a date to the Gold Saucer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades paced the floor in his room, irritated already."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though Hades knew the little game they were playing meant she had to go with him, had to let him think he still had a chance at her heart, he still couldn’t stop the possessive anger from overwhelming him, and he’d stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And now, Hades paced."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Relief flooded Hades instantaneously, and he put a hand to his head, only to feel the anger again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Aren’t you?” Hades asked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades caught the boy before he could, and a moment later he felt the power returning to his fingers, so close, so very close."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “How long?” Hades asked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades took the infant, too absorbed in his thoughts to see the way Elidibus watched him as he turned to the vanity, and visibly relaxed, his Ascian’s mark appearing, at long last, before his face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Remember, Emet-Selch - don’t go on some rampage now that you are restored to your power."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If you run off, she’ll be looking for any sign of Ascian activity, which will lead her straight to me.” Hades was always easy to manipulate where (Y\/N) was concerned."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades shook his head, and turned back to his old friend, an eyebrow raised, only to transmute to marble at the sight of the small earring, a gold, diamond-shaped stud, with a single teardrop pearl dangling from it, the companion to his own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hello, Emet-Selch!” She gave him a wave, tilting to the side and standing on one leg."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades glanced between Tataru and Olivier."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I would never -” Hades began, but Olivier held up a hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I look ridiculous,” Hades said, glancing down at himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades flipped it open to see a not insubstantial amount of gil."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades flipped through the wallet again for a few moments, familiarizing himself with the directions provided."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades would have a fit!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You know how possessive he -” The door opened, and Hades turned to see Tataru dragging his intended into the room."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh, Hades thought, looking at the scandalously tiny bits of fabric the Lalafell had stuffed her into."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Miniskirts, Hades decided, are the greatest invention of this era."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades barely noticed the Valet taking the keys from him, and he pulled her close."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You could have done that in my bedroom,” she said, and headed inside - but her hand didn’t leave his, and for the first time, Hades realized he was excited about more than just her bedroom."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watched in delight as she slowly unwound before him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades slowed to a stop and laughed, causing (Y\/N) to turn and come to his side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had never run so fast in his life, rushing out of her field of view so that he could use his Ascian teleportation without her seeing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “They’re only open a few more minutes, Hades.”  Emet-Selch  Solus zos Galvus  Hades The paperwork, making it all very official, sat in an envelope on the dresser, while Hades and his bride leaned against the railing of the balcony, watching the evening’s fireworks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It’s nothing difficult, just…” Hades held up the earring, and felt himself blush."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could see (Y\/N) knew what the question really meant: Do you still want me?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades and (Y\/N) enjoy their wedding night."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades swallowed anxiously, and approached her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades caught her words with his lips, shoving them back down her throat with his own tongue as he explored every inch of her mouth as voraciously as he could."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Keeping his lips on hers, and his finger through the makeshift lead, Hades pulled her back into the room with him, then turned, hooking one foot behind hers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades shrugged out of the shirt, and grinned when she made a tiny gasp, making a mental note to hire Tataru the minute they returned."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" (Y\/N) let herself fall back onto the satin coverlet, her hair pooling beneath her head and laughed, her whole torso shaking with the action, and it made Hades chuckle as well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" (Y\/N) belongs to Hades, and Hades to (Y\/N)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" (Y\/N) laughed again, delight evident on her face, and Hades pulled her into his arms, peppering her neck with kisses."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I could have had you a dozen times.” Hades sank his teeth into her shoulder."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Say it again, Hades.” Hades grinned and reached for her, sliding his hand around her neck and letting his thumb brush against her earring, the twin of his own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It’s not, my dear - my darling,” Hades gasped, giving in to the tension coiling inside him, letting one hand slip from her neck to her breast, rolling it in his hand and tweaking her nipple gently."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Don’t you dare cum until I have, Hades.” Hades laughed victoriously, and wrapped his arms around her, pulling her down to his chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “H-Hades,” she moaned, and he felt her legs slide up, letting him plunge in deeper."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades, please.” Her brow wrinkled with strain as she came up to the edge, and he did as any good husband should, pushing her off the precipice into an orgasm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Why does that sound like a dangerous proposition?” Hades asked, raising one eyebrow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After their marriage, the days began to slip through Hades’s fingers like seed pearls - tiny, precious things they were, each as idyllic as the last - or as much as they could be with their adversaries breathing down their necks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was in those stolen moments that Hades could see eternity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades almost wished to tell her of it, but (Y\/N) had insisted she not know."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades sighed, wearily."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades did not hesitate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Anger, hot and heavy and red, welled up within Hades, and he rushed the boy, claws of his Ascian form extended toward him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For a few moments, Hades knew nothing else."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He had not come into this room as Solus zos Galvus, Garlean Emperor, but as Emet-Selch, the Ascian."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “The morning before we married.” Hades replied."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “... to kill himself.” Hades finished."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades smiled, warmed through."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Is that what you’ve been waiting for?” Hades asked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Zodiark, tell them I did it, if you must.” Hades rained kisses on her lips, her face, her hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades kissed her one last time, fighting back against the tears he could feel pricking at his own eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I have stolen the powers of darkness, and taken on a new name - Emet-Selch!” She had brought her chaos and rebellion into Doma and Ala Mhigo, and right into Hades’s own withered heart."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As Solus\/Hades is our viewpoint character, he does not get to see the inner workings of the Main Character's mind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So, as he walked, Emperor Solus zos Galvus of the Eternal Empire of Garlemald, Emet-Selch, the Architect, cast an appraising eye over the potential Legati."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I thought you could be of use to me.” Hades grumbled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could not let it touch the ground."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She sat and wept and twisted the ring on her finger and wrote that for you.” Every word was an arrow to Hades’s heart."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Lady (Y\/N),” Hades corrected reflexively."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades laughed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “My literally eternal gratitude?” Hades replied, playfully."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That, I can relate to.” Hades realized he was becoming a romantic and hated it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, Hades stared at the map in front of him for a long time, wheels turning in his head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades did not even care for the expense, or the lost lives as she decimated his fleet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades rushed into the water, swimming past floating wreckage and bodies as quickly as he could, heading for her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As Hades brought the last men of the unit he’d left in Castrum Centri home, he stumbled upon Seneca van Sergius."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He took a moment, and let himself stop being Hades, slipping back into the armor of Solus zos Galvus, then spoke."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As he stared up, Hades was homesick, too."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Are you ready, my love?” Hades whispered to the empty air."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades heard the quiet groan as a thousand bows were pulled taut."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh, my darling, Hades thought, staring at her with open longing, I will make you a legend, tonight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades thought smugly, while his men stared in mute horror that someone could get through their Emperor’s proven shield."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was almost time to put Hades’s plan into action."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It shrieked and groaned as Hades opened it from the inside."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Leaving Fordola outside the medical tent, Hades dragged (Y\/N) into the command tent, barely waiting for the flap to close before he caught her lips with his, hungry again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “(Y\/N),” Hades whispered, “Give yourself to me.” His voice was half whine and half command, but all desperation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades went a bit slower, then, watching her face and caressing her skin, and she started to relax."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I will do this, if you want me to, but…” Hades glanced askance for a moment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Besides, I am the wife of Hades, the Amaurotine, the Ascian, the Architect."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades would reach for her, imagining her tear stained face, her blood, and it would excite him, only for his own body to disobey him just before he touched her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades?” she whispered, and he felt her hand on his cheek, her thumb stroking his skin, smearing tears he had not known were there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I want you,” Hades replied, pressing his ancient, yearning lips to her neck."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She responded eagerly, her hand brushing his shaft while she murmured, “Hades it has been too long."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades braced himself, one hand on the table, and lifted the other, curling his fingers so that he could rub her clitoris with his knuckles to avoid scratching her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You know the Empire will not accept Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “True enough,” Hades said, and he kissed her one last time as his true self."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She hissed, an hour later, as she was thrown to the ground in the Menageries, at the feet of Emperor Solus zos Galvus, the Ascian known as Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus had said he wanted her distracted, that he considered Emet-Selch a fair price to remove the Warrior of Light from this game of Rejoinings."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was only too happy to oblige him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “To be honest, I was more worried about Emet-Selch realizing than (Y\/N)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She knew what Hades would demand once he knew, and she knew that the Elder Seedseer would not take long to realize who the child’s true father was."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades returned to the war table, and let his fingers linger a moment over the map of Eorzea, thinking of his wife."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades woke in stillness, floating in the ruins of Amaurot, frozen in time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades walked closer, and glanced up at his own face, the horror in his eyes, the understanding, the moment of his own personal Calamity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So desperately in love, and too powerful for ones so lacking in wisdom.” Hades closed his eyes for a moment, then turned to look at her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You never did anything by half-measures, my love,” Hades whispered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Persephone was always quite beautiful.” Elidibus said, and Hades bore his teeth at his use of her most secret name, her true name in ancient Amaurot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I know, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Who?” Hades stared up into his beloved’s eyes again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hello, Emet-Selch.” Hades looked at the board as well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “The Architect, and not the Emissary?” Hades raised an eyebrow towards his old friend."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch took a few moments to reconsider his situation, and looked down at the mask still sitting in his lap - the thorns that twisted across its surface a mirror of those wrapped about his heart."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades took his pawn from c5, and moved it to d4, taking the rook."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades released a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “(Y\/N) will not suffer Kan-E-Senna to live if she makes the attempt.” Hades replied, and moved his king from a5 to a4."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades scoffed, and moved his queen from d6 to d5, taking a pawn."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’s chest tightened, and his mouth went dry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades carefully moved his queen from d5 to c4."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Too much is at stake for you to do aught but speak plainly.” Hades grumbled, while Ryne moved another pawn forward, from c2 to c3, to which she quietly whispered “Check,” but he captured it immediately with his king from b4."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “So long as there is equilibrium between Zodiark and Hydaelyn, between Eorzea and Garlemald, between Emet-Selch and (Y\/N), I will be content."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades moved his king out of the white queen’s path, from c3 to d2."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades sighed in exasperation and moved his king from d2 to d1."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You can keep her.” Hades opened his mouth to retort, but the girl continued."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “She’ll still be dead.” Hades tried not to think about the bitterness and pain in his voice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You were always tied to the Underworld, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’s hands shook as he took the rook at d7 with his own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I love the Hades\/WOL ship."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ryne smiled and moved her bishop form f1 to c4, capturing Hades’s queen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Just because I have never been interested in marriage, romance, or sex does not mean I don’t see the way they rule those around me,” Elidibus nodded in approval as Ryne moved the white queen from b2 to h8, capturing one of Hades’s rooks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades said nothing, and moved his rook from d7 to d3."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ryne moved her pawn from f3 to f4, and Hades could feel the child’s eyes on him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades moved his rook to d2."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “For millennia, I struggled to rejoin Zodiark - to bring Him back to His full power so that He might stand against Hydaelyn as equals.” He looked up, behind Hades, to Hydaelyn, where Her image floated amidst the destruction."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades raised an eyebrow, but the Emissary continued."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Deep within that woman, your Persephone -” Hades made a weak noise of protest, but he was waved back to silence."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But she will break the rest of us just the same if you will not forsake your pride, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You must choose, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stared down at the chessboard before him, and picked up the black king."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had spent a long time considering what he would say when he saw her next, and every day that passed had made it harder."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This reunion was for no one but (Y\/N) and Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I… All right,” Hades pushed the door closed, and let the darkness envelop them both, save the small sliver of light from parted curtains at the far end of the room."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades, I…” When Asina pronounced both child and mother ready to receive visitors, Hades was the first in the room, banishing the rest of them with a wave of his hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades snorted derisively."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades finally allowed himself to look, once his back was to (Y\/N), once he was sure she would not see the tears if he had been betrayed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All the rest of him was as (R\/N) as his mother, and for some reason that pleased Hades more than anything else."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But, as your father, it is also my duty to give you your first mask.” Hades touched the boys hair, and the color changed, rippling to his own dark auburn."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades ran a hand irritably through his hair, and examined himself in the mirror again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As Hades stepped out of the palace, a cheer went up, and the speakers surrounding the wide boulevard that led to the palace began to play the Colonial Anthem of the Garlean Empire."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This is definitely NOT the only Emet-Selch fic I have, as Christmas Wish is still being updated (A reverse-isekai fic where he comes to the real world to spend time with the main character)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What I don’t understand is why one would infuse part of their soul into a familiar.” Emet-Selch rebutted in disbelief, finally straightening up and turning his eyes away from me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch turned to look at Hythlodaeus, already on the defensive as the other man smiled at him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch grimaced, apparently realizing that speaking to his friend was a losing battle, and turned back to face me, practically shooing me away with just his expression."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Somehow, Emet-Selch’s eyebrows managed to furrow even deeper."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch merely crossed his arms and shook his head, squeezing his eyes shut as if he could shut out the entire situation if he only kept them closed long enough."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Despite his initial grumbling, both Hythlodaeus and the events of the day seemed sufficient to wear down the ever-weary Emet-Selch even further, and soon we were all sitting peacefully on a train back to Amaurot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch and Hythlodaeus each took a window seat, while I sat next to Hythlodaeus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Unsurprisingly, Emet-Selch took no time in crossing his arms and closing his eyes, opting to nap to pass the time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Where this snap previously had always been accompanied by impressive magicks and conjuration, now it was simply to jolt me out of my slumber, and I started, opening my eyes in time to see Emet-Selch pulling his hand back to place it on his hip instead."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was night and day—literally and figuratively—comparing it to the replica Emet-Selch had made in the Tempest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This is what Emet-Selch had been seeing in his mind as he created his lonely bastardization, what he had been longing for as he walked those empty streets."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Well, run along to your master now,” Emet-Selch told me once I looked at him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch side eyed his friend in annoyance before flicking his eyes back to me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I turned to look at it briefly before returning my gaze back to him, watching in confusion as he winked to me, and turned to resume his departure with Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I found I was already familiar with the layout, despite it technically being my first time here, thanks to Emet-Selch’s recreation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She squinted her eyes, clearly having more trouble in seeing whatever it was she was looking for than either Hythlodaeus or Emet-Selch had."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “From what I know, very few…Emet-Selch being one of them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My eyes widened at that, and suddenly my final battle with Emet-Selch flashed through my mind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though the fact that the shade had noticed it and not Emet-Selch himself was perplexing…perhaps it was due to Hythlodaeus’ keen sight that he was able to see it, and that talent had carried on, even in a recreation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch, he…I think he did."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A fire burned within me, a determination to change what had transpired between me and Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I wasn’t going to return to the time I came from—a time where Emet-Selch was already dead and the Final Days hot on our heels."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not too far before, of course, as the thought of reliving the same months or even years mortified me, but I would still rather put myself through that than accidentally return to the time where Emet-Selch was already dead."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My determination to make absolutely sure Emet-Selch was well surprised me, though I chalked it up to Azem merely motivating me, and not wanting to let her down."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not to mention her and Emet-Selch had been friends, the same way Emet-Selch had been friends with Hythlodaeus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The shard Ryne’s voice echoed from was from the confrontation with Emet-Selch, right before I had begun my fight with him in earnest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch was meant to die and I couldn’t change that outcome."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I couldn’t help but break out into a smile—relief that I had made it in time to save Emet-Selch, for one, and that I was also able to see Ardbert again, even if it was fleeting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You wondered how Emet-Selch must feel, being as alone as he is…And I wonder the same thing, too."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I was back to where the final confrontation with Emet-Selch happened, on my hands and knees as I grasped at my chest and continued to gulp in the air around me, overwhelmed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Before, I had used my fight with Hades to release the Light inside of me, but now that I had Azem’s supplementary pieces of soul, it seemed I was truly able to contain it, though not without effort."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Through the ringing, though, I did manage to hear Emet-Selch call out my title—no, Azem’s title, and as I stumbled forward in my delirium, I was caught by a pair of arms."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I did it, Hades…I’m…containing the Light.” “Hades, help me out here,” Hythlodaeus implored of the third in their trio now, realizing he wouldn’t be able to best Azem alone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “As the honorable Emet-Selch of the Convocation, surely you can make up some sort of reason for her to have to stay in Amaurot…or some such.” Hythlodaeus stared down at Emet-Selch, who had also been sleeping on the grass much like Azem, and hung his head when he received no reply."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Azem peeked at Emet-Selch herself now, wondering if he was truly fast asleep, before being struck by an idea."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We can simply sleep together, right, Hades?” Not realizing her phrasing was already peculiar to begin with, the fact that Azem had deemed to use Hades’ name instead of his title for that sentence only furthered to misconstrue the intimate meaning."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What on Etheirys are you going on about now?” Emet-Selch asked, and if he had been sleeping, he was now very much awake."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ah, that is what you meant,” he laughed to Azem, before leaning down to Emet-Selch and whispering."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch deigned to open his eyes once more as he glared at his annoying friend, simply so that he could close them again as he let his head fall heavy onto the grass once more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch immediately scoffed at her words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Well I, for one, wouldn’t mind booking some days off to go with you.” Hythlodaeus told her, before turning to Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Whether I desire it or not, I will inevitably join her on her adventures regardless—the only difference being whether I leave with her at the start, or I am unceremoniously summoned into some ridiculous situation that she has deemed fit to involve me in.” Emet-Selch retorted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He made sure to lean in to whisper at a volume that Emet-Selch would no doubt still hear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The only thing that remained the same—that remained familiar, was that I could hear his voice, could hear Emet-Selch speaking to somebody…Two people?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades…?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Azem,” Emet-Selch called to me, sitting on my bedside and looking at me with guarded hope, and it broke my heart."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And yet attempting to view him in that light—the light of an Ascian, of the evil and plotting Emet-Selch, suddenly felt so wrong."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades, what is it?” I all but pleaded, desperate for him to talk to me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He inhaled sharply as I implored, and I pursed my lips, wondering why I didn’t use Emet-Selch, the name I knew him by and had exclusively been using until now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I closed my mouth in realization—realization that, in this timeline, we had never had our final all-out battle, and so he had never revealed his name to me, and I shouldn’t know that his true name is Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And in it, I had called him Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It had felt like a millennia since I’d experienced this, and yet I knew in my mind I had only known Emet-Selch for all but a few weeks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All too soon, those arms around me vanished, and I looked up with my tear-streaked face to see Emet-Selch looking quite as annoyed as I’d ever seen him, a grimace on his face as he stared incredulously and unimpressed at Thancred, who pointed his gunblade at him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch rolled his eyes dramatically, slouching even further in disbelief."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I care not what your read on me is, for any you come up with based on my actions alone are doomed to be woefully wrong regardless,” Emet-Selch shrugged."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Indeed, what about later?” Emet-Selch waved his hand as if he could just shoo her away from annoying him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch rubbed his eyes, looking very much like he wanted nothing more than to sleep."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch took a moment longer than he probably needed, before nodding."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Is of no importance to you.” Emet-Selch turned to him, evidently weary of their interrogations, but putting up with it all the same."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ordinarily, yes,” Emet-Selch agreed easily, “Though, due to the second reason that I will not disclose, even if she were to suddenly lose control of the Light, you would still be able to count me as an ally.” “Oh, I will most assuredly be doing both.” Emet-Selch informed her, and Thancred narrowed his eyes again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Don’t antagonize them,” I hissed at Emet-Selch, and he only shrugged at me, his face a woeful grimace as if his mother had just scolded him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch looked at Y’shtola sharply then, narrowing his eyes as he pointed at her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch!” I called for him, though immediately dialed it back due to the two onlookers who seemed very surprised by my cry, and I attempted to sound less frantic."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At my groans of pain, Emet-Selch froze at the portal, turning to watch me with that same wary hope in his eyes, but when I regained my composure, merely panting heavily, he only spared me a quick glance before turning back around."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To be honest, Emet-Selch wasn’t sure himself why he still bothered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even when Lahabrea had still been alive, the fool had been too consumed by his desire for chaos to do much anything else of note—no, he had not managed to accomplish even a modicum of what Emet-Selch himself had been able to in all the time given to them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Truly, Emet-Selch did not understand why he still suffered himself with the formalities of these meetings."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And so, Emet-Selch had simply stopped trying."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “So, their hero has contained the Light…” Elidibus murmured to himself in thought, not surprising Emet-Selch in the least that he had immediately latched onto the more technical part of the plan, rather than the fact that their dear friend may yet not be lost to them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch shrugged, shaking his head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch nodded."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He still wasn’t seeing her as Azem, as one of their colleagues potentially returned to them, and Emet-Selch himself was not sure why he was still giving him so many chances to do so."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And yet you don’t seem convinced that she will join us, despite you saying she is regaining her old self.” Elidibus pointed out, earning a shrug from Emet-Selch in response."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch first noticed the silence, and then only a moment later realized the cause of it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s words didn’t seem to have much effect on the other man, as his knuckles continued to steadily rap on his chin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch could instinctively feel the corners of his mouth turn down."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus pondered for a moment longer, finally bringing his knuckles down from his face as he turned to look at Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch scrunched up his nose in distate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch merely crossed his arms and frowned, waiting for further elaboration."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If she only remembers her fondness for you and the times of the past, of her longing for the unsundered world, she will view us in a positive light,” Elidibus explained to Emet-Selch, who’s eyes were narrowing further and further by the second."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch continued to stare through his narrowed eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s frown only deepened somehow, if that were possible."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All the better if you deem it to be official Ascian business and leave it to me.” Emet-Selch turned to walk out of the portal, giving Elidibus a lazy wave as he did so."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A few weeks had already passed since Emet-Selch had left."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Luckily, however, being apart from Emet-Selch also allowed my feelings to cool."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did Emet-Selch feel this same longing that I did?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Echo I’d seen before—of Emet-Selch, Hythloadeus and I—I’d managed to remember parts of what had led up to all three of us napping there on that grass."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not only was my motivation simply remembering my life as Azem, but also so that I would properly be able to share in Emet-Selch’s deep sadness, to carry some of his burdens, and to reassure him he’s no longer alone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Now that Emet-Selch remained alive, Elidibus, in turn, would most likely have no reason to fight us."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Like so many times before, Emet-Selch stood off to the side, unperturbed as always despite all eyes being cautiously on him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch shrugged his arms out and looked at us, as if that were all the proof we needed to see that they had clearly become the best of friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch slouched further, clearly annoyed they were rushing his theatrics."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch looked between everyone in the room, all staring at him, before giving a slight shrug."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A chorus of exasperated groans echoed throughout the Ocular as Emet-Selch continued to look innocently on, and G’raha tapped his staff on the floor twice, attempting to regain civility."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After a murmur of begrudging agreements, Emet-Selch smiled and, with all eyes on him, could not help his theatrical manner as he spread his arms out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The timeline I had been from, we had only learned of Fandaniel once the towers had already been constructed, but now, with Emet-Selch alive, we were learning of him much sooner."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the depths of the Tempest, there yet lies an unmolested Ascian ruin, ripe to be sullied by your various filthy hands!” Emet-Selch finished, his arms wide by his side, followed by them quickly dropping as he resumed his hunched posture."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" However…” Her milky eyes flicked up to Emet-Selch then, and it made me wonder what she saw when she looked at him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch raised his eyebrows, as if he hadn’t actually been expecting it to be so easy, but at least he managed to refrain from saying so out loud."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Going to a shady location guided by Emet-Selch is one thing, but to willingly step into one of those dark, Ascian portals?” Thancred balked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Why Emet-Selch came along with us was a mystery to us all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You are going to be riding a whale.” Emet-Selch said in a defeated tone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Majestically filthy, perhaps.” Emet-selch scrunched his nose, and, as someone who had only very recently cleaned barnacles off of it, I unfortunately could not argue that fact."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ah yes, which reminds me,” Emet-Selch turned to me, ignoring the fuming Alisaie, who’s face only began to match her outfit more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I heard voices of protest call out for me as Emet-Selch led me away, but they were soon muffled by the wispy darkness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Before I even had time to register going into the portal, I was already stepping out of it, and Emet-Selch was already stepping away from me, gathering his hand from my back all too soon."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By the time I had finished I was panting, tears pricking in my eyes from both the realization that my relationships would never feel the same, and because, despite all I’d said, Emet-Selch’s expression still hadn’t changed in the slightest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But, just as Emet-Selch’s real name was Hades, I suppose I would soon find out what Azem’s…or, my true name was."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Having at least a clear goal in mind gave me renewed vigor, and I looked out at the replicated Amaurot before turning back to Emet-Selch with a forced smile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At my request, Emet-Selch snapped, bringing us in front of a familiar building."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Before Emet-Selch could explain why he’d deigned to bring me to this specific building, I had already pushed open the doors and was making my way in."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh, I do love the theatre,” Emet-Selch remarked as he watched me, arms crossed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch opted to lean against the door in his blasé manner, looking relaxed as ever."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch raised his eyebrows slightly as he stared at my display through half lidded eyes, unamused, before giving me a slow clap."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch leaned forward from his resting pose against the wall, tilting his head at me as he smiled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Well, this is subtle.” Azem remarked with a dry smile, looking at the mask in her hands and waving it to Emet-Selch, who was leaning against the office door."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Azem looked up to Emet-Selch at his words, wondering what he meant, and how he could be so sure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh, of that I have no doubt…” Emet-Selch sighed, already drained at the prospect and rubbing the bridge of his nose."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Says you.” Emet-Selch shrugged."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Exactly!” Azem laughed, earning a small smirk from Emet-Selch as well, which, to her, always felt like an accomplishment no matter how many times she’d achieved it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch had stayed in his position near the wall during my time enraptured by the Echo, but he no longer had his nonchalant demeanor, and was watching me with great interest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Memories of being scolded by Hades—Emet-Selch—urging me to summon him more, and to make my trips back to Amaurot more of a regular occurrence, as my string of long and sudden absences caused all of the members to worry, and yet the only one I’d ever remembered seeing with a crease of worry between their brows had been him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s hand was holding my hair out of my face as he crouched next to me, observing me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As if reading my mind, Emet-Selch handed me a cup of water after a quick snap, and I took it greedily, chugging it in only a few gulps."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch pressed me no further after that, his shadowed eyes still looking past me as he thought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My slower pace matched Emet-Selch’s, and now that we walked side by side, I noticed the way his gaze seemed to linger on me before turning elsewhere."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Well, what’s the next stop on memory lane?” I asked Emet-Selch, flicking my eyes over to him before realizing I was only met with the black of my hood, and so I turned my head fully, looking up at him as I directed both my gaze and my question at him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Apparently there was humour in what I’d said, because even in the sour mood he was in, Emet-Selch couldn’t help but crack a smile as he snapped his fingers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “So, Emet-Selch was a worry-wart when it came to his friends,” I mused."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I didn’t draw attention to any of that, however, and simply began to inch closer to the bed as Emet-Selch did the exact opposite, once again finding a wall to stand by and create distance between us."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I sat upright in it, smoothing my hands over the sheets and twiddling my thumbs as I waited awkwardly, Emet-Selch observing from the wall across from the bed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Through it all, until I stabilized, the blurry visage of Emet-Selch was a constant at my side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After all, I couldn’t exactly see Emet-Selch befriending and smiling his way through life like Hythlodaeus and I preferred."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If not one side, then the other would be taken, and as if on cue, that familiar shade of purple hair now took the side opposite of Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And soon an exit to match, if she continues to be so careless,” Emet-Selch snapped, and although my eyes were closed, I imagined him shaking his head, or pinching the bridge of his nose."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “She did not, indeed.” And at that, Emet-Selch now turned the full brunt of his ire to me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It had nothing to do with strength!” I burst out, causing a smug grin to form on Emet-Selch’s face, and only then did I realize I had fallen into his trap of baiting me out of my pretend-slumber."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch looked to me, and then to Hythlodaeus, and then back to me, clearly failing to find the humour in the situation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And, even in matters not concerning Emet-Selch, but simply Hades, it is no burden to me should you ever need rely on my capabilities, as Azem or otherwise.” Emet-Selch looked as though the stench of rotten food permeated through the air as he balked at his friend."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I laughed as the two’s worries about me soon devolved into their usual back and forth, and I resolved at that moment to truly value my life more, even at the cost of my pride, or any embarrassment—which would no doubt be overwhelming when I was to be dragged to a sickbed by Emet-Selch for minor wounds."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" …I opened my eyes, turning my head to see Emet-Selch once more by my bedside, so similar to the Echo I had just seen that his dark hair and more pallor complexion shocked me more than it should have, and I took a moment to adjust as he looked down at me with curiosity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I smiled, noticing not only how I was becoming more comfortable in referring to myself and Azem as one in the same, but how Emet-Selch, too, had also referred to me as her again just now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As with last time, Emet-Selch made to bring me outside, though as I was on my side, he opted to scoop me into his arms."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Venat training me in various types of weapons for differing circumstances, memories of when I’d tried to put them into practice successfully or not, more memories of being in the hospital bed, Hythlodaeus and Emet-Selch always by my side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Battles where I’d summoned friends to my side, or Emet-Selch, who always wore a look of pure distaste as if he’d rather have been anywhere else, but his presence always reassured me, and I knew I’d be safe—and despite his apparent annoyance at being summoned, he was never quick to return to Amaurot afterwards, always making sure everything had been completely settled, double and triple checking I would be fine in his absence ere he returned."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Why do mere memories cause you such physical turmoil?” Emet-Selch demanded from beside me, clearly perturbed at the state I was in."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch only frowned, having bent down beside me once more, though soon returned to his feet with a forced glibness to his demeaner that made me hasten to compose my own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “My dashing Hades, what has happened to your hair?” Emet-Selch couldn’t stop thinking about her sudden onslaught of memories, and even though it must no doubt be unpleasant to her, it was nonetheless good to learn that she need only experience one Echo in order to then trigger hundreds of memories."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “My dashing Hades, what has happened to your hair?” For a moment Emet-Selch wondered if his magicks to keep a barrier of air around the Tempest had suddenly failed, for it felt as though ice-water had been dumped on him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades swallowed the thick lump in his throat, willing himself to ask her the question that burned within him for thousands upon thousands of lifetimes, full knowing it would be fruitless, and yet still he had to try."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades felt his own voice buckling beneath the weight of his question as he stared into those familiar eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades leaned his head forward, bringing it to hers as he closed his eyes, both of his hands upon her face now as he continued to soothe her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was for this very reason that Hades had done everything in his power to make certain—to make absolutely certain—that when he was creating all of the shades for his reflection of Amaurot, that he didn’t accidentally make Persephone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “While I’m happy you’ve decided to make up for lost time now that we’re finally lovers, expressing that so…publicly…may not be wise, Hades.” Emet-Selch and Azem."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades and Persephone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades, too hard.” She suddenly panted into his ear, and he realized how tightly he had been holding her as he embraced her, as if trying to crush her into him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How quickly all of his iron will and planning as Emet-Selch had crumbled before her, reverting him simply to Hades, longing for his Persephone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Forgive me.” Hades said again, this time with more resolve in his voice as he held Persephone by her small shoulders and stepped back to create distance between them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She would not remember this, that much was certain, but it also remained that she could come to her senses at any moment, which, Hades realized, was for the best."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And yet Emet-Selch was not one to forsake his duties for his own happiness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades, I thought we—” Hades snapped his fingers, and she blinked out of sight, teleporting her back to where her friends were, where she would no doubt regain her senses as the Warrior of Light once she was away from here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades remained unmoving, still slumped over as he listened."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I may be just a shade of myself, but no matter the form I take, I will forever remain your friend, Hades.” It told him, and despite the distortion in the voice that being a shade brought, it was still undeniably his."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “But for once, our dear Hades, allow yourself the reprieve."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And for the first time, Hades took it without argument."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Were you not supposed to be with Emet-Selch?” Y’shtola asked me then, her eyes narrowing as she crossed her arms."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We weren’t fighting, and Emet-Selch didn’t do anything to hurt me,” I reassured as quickly as I could, hoping to quell the rage that was palpable in the air."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I sat on a nearby rock as I explained everything to them as best as I could—how Emet-Selch had taken me to Amaurot once more in hopes of talking, and how, once there, I had begun to reawaken memories of my past life, memories that belonged to the soul which burned brightly within me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Luckily, Y’shtola and Thancred had apparently filled the others in on my near-rejoined state after the confrontation with Emet-Selch, and what had happened in the Crystarium between us, and so the others were not nearly as surprised as they would have been if it had been their first time hearing as such."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “So, it’s true then…” Y’shtola murmured, and she was looking at my chest the same way Emet-Selch had done so many times."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Still, can we really be sure of Emet-Selch’s goals?” Alphinaud posited to the group, earning a glare from his sister after she had just made the atmosphere light again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We have already learned that the ancients—the people of Emet-Selch’s time—they were not evil Ascians."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Although I don’t believe there is any intrinsic harm in regaining such memories, it still remains to be seen what Emet-Selch’s motive truly is for wishing such a thing.” “We can all agree then that our friend can regain these memories if she wishes, but to continue to be wary of Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Well, let us continue on our path to the Anamnesis that Emet-Selch has laid out for us."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Despite his snark, nobody had it in them to offer any sort of rebuttal as we all made our way in, gazing up and around at the facility around us.Having already seen it once before, my eyes were instead only on Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “In such vessels did the ancients preserve concepts—ideal forms to be drawn upon in the act of creation.” Urianger explained, turning to look at Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I suppose, to some.” Emet-Selch shrugged, his smirk only growing as Y’shtolas eyes narrowed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Clearly set off by his smugness, Thancred clicked his tongue as he took striding steps towards Emet-Selch, who in turn remained unmoved."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch rolled his eyes, until they fell on me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch merely shook his head with an ever-exasperated groan, placing a hand on his hip as the other pinched the bridge of his nose."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I couldn’t say I was happy with Emet-Selch, but If I at least didn’t stand up for him, nobody else would."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch raised his eyebrows in approval, holding his arm out to me as if to say and there you have it, before turning his back on us all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Perhaps Emet-Selch didn’t want Azem back for the reasons I'd hoped, and they were right—that he was simply intending to manipulate me to their cause."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You think so?” Ryne suddenly asked softly, her eyes still lingering on where Emet-Selch had just vanished."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Along with the relief, and the realization that I now understood more aptly what Emet-Selch had wished to see in my own eyes—this familiarity, this warmth— And so it had ample time to wander, and it always wandered back to Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch walked in at his typical languid pace, though it probably took most of us a few seconds to even register that it was Emet-Selch we were looking at."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No longer was he Solus Zos Galvus, but Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades, your hair.” Was all I could say, and the way I automatically used his name seemed to surprise me just as much as him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Apparently asking Emet-Selch—an Ascian—who had suddenly appeared in the Scions’ headquarters, if he wanted something as mundane as tea, was what had finally caused the bubble of silence within the room to burst."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thancred, with his body still not up to snuff as it was, was attempting to get up and presumably try to push Emet-Selch out himself if only he could get his body to do as he commanded, but was luckily talked down by Krile beside him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I looked to Emet-Selch sheepishly amidst the rabble."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When it was clear we had all satisfactorily shut up, she turned her attention to Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Have we not already established our cooperation?” Emet-Selch asked, walking further into the room as everybody visibly stiffened, no doubt painfully aware of how weak they currently were."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch groaned, turning towards Tataru, who froze under his golden stare."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What could only be a combination of being too stunned to refuse, along with the fact that Tataru no doubt realized this was the Emet-Selch in which I had told her about, she promptly did as he asked despite his rudeness, stepping behind the bar to pull out a bottle with a dark, golden liquid inside."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In her flustered haste, she turned to and fro, searching for a cup, and Emet-Selch snapped, creating one for her on the bar."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch nodded at her, before throwing his head back and downing the glass in one swig."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Now then, how many times must we go over this?” Emet-Selch asked, sweeping his gaze along the entire room as he grimaced, opting to close his eyes and take another swig lest his anger get the best of him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Although you may not know my exact motives, surely you can surmise, at this point, that it is not to kill you and yours?” Emet-Selch implored, as if searching for a shred of intelligence in the room."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades, enough.” I urged, standing beside him at the bar and lightly touching his arm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I reached out for the bottle from Tataru, filling his glass once more, though this time I was the one to drink it as Emet-Selch watched on in amused surprise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" While certainly embarrassing for me, at the very least the sacrifice of my pride had managed to take some of the dark cast off of both the room, and Emet-Selch’s face as he continued to watch me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch is right,” Y’shtola finally sighed, settling back in her seat as she picked up her teacup once again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I for one would like to trust you, since our dear friend seems to,” Alphinaud began, watching the way I had closed the distance between me and Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What you know of me will remain as it is,” Emet-Selch interrupted him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch looked out at their hesitant faces, and smiled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “So you, too, merely wish to fight for a friend,” G’raha observed softly—a little too softly, it seemed, as the emotion in his voice only caused Emet-Selch to roll his eyes in distaste."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But where I was able to save Emet-Selch as I had planned, just how many friends had he lost in those dark timelines?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In that realization it only stood to reason that he would understand Emet-Selch and his yearning for his past, to not forget it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And I have no disagreements with that,” Emet-Selch agreed easily."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Our ally identified you thus to be Hades, If I recall.” “Yes, Hades is my true name, if you must know,” he admitted to them all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch certainly wasn’t moved by the gesture, however, and deigned only to shrug rather than say whatever dismissive thing he may have been thinking."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Tell us then, Emet-Selch, I don’t mean to be rude, but then why are you here?” Krile finally addressed him, having opted to simply watch the previous exchange as Tataru had, unfamiliar with Emet-Selch as they were."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch turned lazily to Krile, and I shot him a look that I prayed he could feel, willing him not to call her a dwarf as he had with Tataru."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “So long as it is what our friend here desires, I see no reason why we should stand in her way,” G’raha was the first to speak up, and I was glad of it, as his acceptance of Emet-Selch meant the most considering he had been the one to come to the most harm by his hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You needn’t worry about that.” Emet-Selch interrupted him, and although I was only seeing him from the profile, his expression was strangely soft as he beheld Alphinaud in that moment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And you say Emet-Selch has been in each of these Echo’s you’ve experienced?” “When you say recreated city, what exactly do you mean?” Krile prodded, her eyes flicking over to Emet-Selch now, who had opted to lean with his arms crossed against the wall behind me and to my right rather than join us at the table."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch watched me with an almost derisive amusement during my eager experimentation as I chewed, his expression similar to one watching a child find their way around a new toy for the first time, which of course only caused me to falter in embarrassment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Creation…from aether,” Krile looked at the sandwich a moment longer, then back to Emet-Selch, as if comparing him to his creation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Rather, it was Emet-Selch’s aether itself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I believe the very presence of Emet-Selch’s aether all around you may have spurred it to continue, pushing the Echo to continue and reach beyond what it normally would."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch had already risen from his seat soon after his creation demonstration, and now slowly paced about the room instead, stopping to look at Krile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Lovely sandwich, by the way,” she offered to Emet-Selch as she picked up the basket and made her way for the door."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As Krile shut the door to the Dawn’s Respite softly behind her, I couldn’t help but wonder if the Scions would be as receptive to eating those sandwiches if they’d known Emet-Selch had created them, and I held back a smirk at the thought of telling Thancred after he had already eaten his fill."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Well then, seeing as I have nothing to do and the Scions are still recovering, do you want to make it a day of recovering memories?” I posited cheerfully as I turned to Emet-Selch, trying to make up for his utter lack of it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch continued to close the distance between us as he made his painfully slow strides, finally leaving us a mere two feet apart, and I couldn’t help the way my body stiffened."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My vision was still technically black, as the sight right before my eyes was the darkness of Emet-Selch’s robes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Despite her saying it was a good balance, however, Emet-Selch still couldn’t help but watch stiffly each and every time she doubled over in pain and clutched her head, claiming afterwards it hadn’t been nearly as bad as it had seemed, especially for the amount of memories she’d gotten back in return."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They were activities the Warrior of Light was already inclined to do, regardless, which only made Emet-Selch wonder."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch was snapped out of his own musings when he noticed the warrior nearly tumble over as she walked, readjusting her grip on a crate of some sort, no doubt asked to deliver it to some far off location, if he had to guess."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And so it was.” Emet-Selch held up his arms in a shrug, the smile still faint on his lips as he regarded her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch had spotted a rather nice area for resting, and so rather than waste even more energy making the trip there, he snapped his fingers and soon they were on the tallest part of a nearby mountain, sitting in the fields of grass overlooking a village below."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Seeing her peaceful as she was tempted Emet-Selch to take a nap of his own, as partial to them as he was, but opted to stay awake."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Just by looking, it was clear to Emet-Selch this was no mere nightmare, and yet he covered his bases nonetheless and attempted to simply wake her, but it was clear any interference from the waking world would be lost on her, trapped in whatever plane of torment she was currently in."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In his hurry his teleportation had proved slightly off, and instead of standing in the Scions’ headquarters, Emet-Selch found himself in the tavern outside their doors."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As expected, the gunbreaker was the first to react, lacking the thoughtful intelligence Emet-Selch had come to predict."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He sprung from where he sat, his expression one of shock, outrage, and worry, and Emet-Selch found he did not have time to guess at which emotion would take hold of him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Whether his impromptu trip served to cool his anger or stoke it further, Emet-Selch did not care."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What’s happened to her?” the young male Elezen asked at once, shooting to his feet, his eyes only on her in worry, rather than on Emet-Selch in accusation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Before you barrage me with your ceaseless questions, I would lay her in a bed,” Emet-Selch shot back impatiently, somehow restraining himself from merely snapping them all out of the building so he could do what needed to be done."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With yet another snap from Emet-Selch, however, the Warrior of Light was soon dressed in no more than a simple tunic, and they were able to swiftly tuck her beneath the sheets."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Indeed, the last thing we might need is a confrontation within the infirmary,” the Miqo’te woman agreed, and Emet-Selch didn’t miss the way her eyes—unseeing though they may be—flicked to him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch scoffed, keeping his eyes on the unconscious Warrior of Light who trembled beneath her covers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Well, he wouldn’t have shot at you…” The red twin offered with a slight shrug, but it seemed overall Emet-Selch’s decision to relieve himself of the annoyance of their friend was not one that was wholly argued against."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Was this a result of you testing my hypothesis?” she turned to Emet-Selch then with great worry, her voice laden with guilt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What she is experiencing is not due to my aether—at least, not wholly.” Emet-Selch told her honestly, not wishing to comfort her or any such tripe, but merely speak the truth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “How is she?” The scholar of the Echo—the one whom Emet-Selch had decided as being the most competent and level-headed—asked as she once again made her way into the Dawn’s Respite."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though that she is still in pain I have no doubt.” Emet-Selch offered roughly in response, leaning forward in the chair beside her bed, his elbows resting on his knees as he closely studied both her physical condition and her aetheric one."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch certainly didn’t mind her lack of response, and appreciated that she was not one to fill in empty space with empty words for the mere sake of it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “...I cannot be certain.” Emet-Selch answered simply, and in that brief answer, he responded to both her spoken question and silent question in one—Yes, he did have a suspicion, but no, he would not tell her yet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I saw him then, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Thank Zodiark,” a voice by my bedside exhaled, and I looked to see Hades—Emet-Selch—looking very much as if he could use a nap, the darkness around his eyes darker than I had ever seen it before."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s eyebrows furrowed, his golden eyes boring into me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My words, however, did nothing to assuage Emet-Selch, as he now only looked more affronted, as if I had struck him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I looked to Emet-Selch then, and he frowned at me in a mixture of disbelief and true rage."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades shot him an annoyed look from the corner of his eye, halting his pacing so that he could turn to look at the lavender haired man."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Speaking of Azem,” Hythlodaeus feigned a look of sudden remembrance as he rummaged through his desk, pulling out an envelope that he slipped a piece of parchment into, before sliding it over towards Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades finally stopped pacing in order to glare at it, but in the end, grumbled and accepted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades used his soul sight as he made his way to her apartment, in order to make sure she was even there to begin with."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The thought made Hades scowl as he lifted his hand to knock on her door."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades!” She exclaimed breathlessly, blowing a strand of hair that had fallen in her face away as she did so."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades shot out his hand, preventing her from closing the door further as she looked up at him with quiet curiosity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades couldn’t help the mocking smile that slipped onto his face, nearly at a loss for words at her utterly uninspired retelling."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades immediately realized Hythlodaeus had played him for a fool—no doubt he noticed Hades had had the wrong idea about the entire affair from the start, and yet he further fed into misunderstanding all the more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All but growling under his breath, Hades angrily turned from her as he grumbled something to excuse himself, though he knew it would not be so easy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stood for a moment with his back to her, before he slowly turned, removing her hands from the fabric as he fully looked at her now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was over as quickly as it began as Hades sputtered and stepped back, coughing to cover up the strangled noise of surprise he’d made as he looked down at her with a look of utter bewilderment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hythlodaeus is among them, to be sure.” Hades grumbled, reaching out to wipe a tear that she missed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “The reason I came here in the first place was to deliver that to you, as per his request,” Hades explained, narrowing his eyes suspiciously at the folder."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades watched her as she held the parchment up to her face, her eyes scanning it, until— Azem continued to laugh as Hades snatched it from her, staring at the paper with an expression of pure affront."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades crumpled the paper in his offense, though Azem quickly stepped forward and reached for his hands, trying to stop him before he destroyed it further."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I love you, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You are the only one I would allow to summon me so, the only one able to make the seat of Emet-Selch pick fruit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I love you, Hades.” Hades quickly released her, however, realizing they were still in the hallway of her apartment, and what an unseemly sight this would be for any who happened upon them—let alone as members of the Convocation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades groaned at that, realizing just what he had invited into his life now, but could also not smother the feeling of exhilaration that also began to stir at the thought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades wasn’t sure the expression he made at those words, but it must have been just as she had hoped for, as when he looked to her, she was beaming in delight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Just as mine is yours, Hades.” Her giggles and squeal of both delight and shock at being so easily scooped up into his arms became muffled as Hades swung the apartment door shut behind them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Upon the course of regaining my memories slowly but surely, I had come to realize that I loved Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I then looked to Emet-Selch who, despite having his same white hair, looked drastically different from the one in my memories."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After his utterance of my name, Emet-Selch was no longer by my side lying in the bed, but was now perched on the edge, watching me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Please, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" While it is true that you have not regained your full memories, I can no longer deny that when I look at you, it is Azem I see before me.” Emet-Selch took a weary sigh before he continued, and I could tell I wasn’t going to like what I heard next."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I was silent as I listened, and Emet-Selch inhaled a shuddering breath before he continued."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What you intended to do, and what your thoughts were in those Final Days is a mystery even to me.” Emet-Selch paused to turn and meet my gaze, looking as if he still couldn’t quite believe I was real and returned to him, instead of a mere figment of his imagination."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You wanted me back, and I am here, Hades.” She had been so nervous to close the distance between them mere moments before, yet now that she had her memories of them as lovers returned to her, Persephone no longer had any qualms about nuzzling as close to Emet-Selch as she possibly could."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And so Emet-Selch allowed himself to reach for her in kind; he wrapped her in his arms, close enough that he could feel her heartbeat thrumming in her chest pressed against his own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The peace of the moment was almost enough to make Emet-Selch fall asleep himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With the revival of more of her memories as Persephone, Emet-Selch suspected he had what would be a rather tedious conversation with Elidibus ahead of him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Emet-Selch met his amused glance with one of exhaustion and impatience, the silver haired man only grinned."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Regardless of who offered it, Emet-Selch couldn’t deny that a drink was certainly tempting at the moment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “While it truly is a pity about the company, I would not deny the drink.” Emet-Selch heaved himself into the cushioned single seat across from Thancred, who had only smirked slightly at his unkind words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Perhaps Emet-Selch should make certain the gunbreaker always had a bottle on hand, if it made him so disposed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’ll have to forgive me for not having a second glass prepared,” Thancred mused, taking a sip from his own drink as he pondered it, before flicking his eyes back up to Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a resigned sigh, Emet-Selch raised his hand, snapping a glass into existence and deftly catching it in the same hand he used to conjure it to begin with."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Doubly so when speaking of alcohol, which demands a lengthy fermentation process.”Emet-Selch shrugged one shoulder as he brought the drink up to his lips, finishing it in one swig and holding it out to an exasperated Thancred for a refill."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Yes, that much is clear,” Emet-Selch grimaced into his glass, clearly unimpressed with the choice of whiskey and not missing the way Thancred rolled his eyes as he fell back into the couch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It will hardly surprise you to learn I am here for the drink, rather than your company,” Emet-Selch sighed dramatically, tilting his head up to polish the final dregs of his second glass."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh, I’d wager a good eighty-percent is still thanks to the drink,” Thancred grinned, nudging the bottle of whiskey closer to Emet-Selch with his boot when he reached for it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch couldn’t help the scoff that escaped him as he poured his third drink, looking up at the man across from him with a mocking smile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch gripped his glass tight enough in his hand that it threatened to crack."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The silver haired man only shook his head, surprising Emet-Selch in the fact that he did not deny his claims about their losses not being equal, but merely pressed on with his original point."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It took Emet-Selch a moment to realize what Thancred was alluding to."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A rather uncomfortable silence fell over them after his words, and Emet-Selch came to the conclusion that he didn’t very much like being able to relate to another—especially someone like the man across from him—in such personal and vulnerable ways."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch raised an eyebrow at the rather diplomatic answer, paying no mind to the sensitive feelings at play."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch had no words of comfort to offer, and even if he did, he wouldn’t have spoken them anyhow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But…” His troubled eyes were on Emet-Selch now, as if he would miraculously find the answers somewhere in his face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You do seem to have a hard time keeping your mouth shut.” Emet-Selch agreed easily."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A not altogether uncomfortable silence cascaded over the room this time as they quietly drank the rest of their respective drinks, and seeing the bottle in its near-empty state made Emet-Selch seriously consider conjuring a new one."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Giving me your blessing?” Emet-Selch struggled to think of the appropriate word, waving his hand vaguely as his expression soured."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Was my staying at her bedside for two days without rest what finally tipped you off?” Emet-Selch queried disdainfully."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thancred was shaking his head before Emet-Selch could even finish what his hypothetical motives could have been, raising his eyes to him as if he were accepting a challenge."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch gripped his drink tighter at the memory, a jolt of anxiety running through him as he recalled the urgency he felt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch felt his eyebrows crease upwards in disbelief as he looked at the gunbreaker, a mix of contempt and exasperation at this pointless line of questioning."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With each word that escaped the other man’s mouth, Emet-Selch could feel the corners of his own mouth angling down further and further, uncomfortable at being so easily read in that moment, at such a vulnerable time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch could only raise his eyebrow at the strange statement, but he otherwise did not press for further explanation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Now Emet-Selch was really starting to lament the loss of the bottle, and a conjured one was closer and closer on the horizon with every passing word.“My own situation is not to help you overcome your own personal trauma, gunbreaker."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Although Emet-Selch had been expecting Elidibus to approach him once he’d returned to the Rift, he hadn’t expected him to already be standing there—and by all rights, waiting for him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You are returned,” Elidibus greeted him, and Emet-Selch felt his face fall into its familiar grimace as he regarded the man."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The tone of his voice seemed to imply he had known Emet-Selch would be appearing at that very moment, and the portal to Elidibus’ side only confirmed those thoughts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch did not bother to restrain his look of pure contempt.Perhaps were he slightly more sober, he may have played it off with his usual whimsy and amused indifference."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch only refrained from rolling his eyes so that he could continue to glare at the man."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’ll find I have forgotten nothing, all the more when it pertains to Azem.” Emet-Selch sneered right back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What he said next, Emet-Selch knew it was not what he had initially been about to utter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Memories of her love for you.” There was a softness to Elidibus' tone then, and he wondered whether that was due to the subject of which he spoke, or him merely trying to quell Emet-Selch's still-rising ire."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Is there even a need to speak to me, when you have already taken it upon yourself to claim a front-row seat in the audience?” Emet-Selch curled his lip, his anger only growing as he continued to go through all of what Elidibus must have seen over the past two days."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If Emet-Selch hadn’t been so fraught with emotion, and so exhausted from two days of constant monitoring while staying by Azem’s side, there's no doubt he would have been able to sense Elidibus’ watchful eye over them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Or, did he somehow believe Emet-Selch was at risk of betraying the Ascians, now that he was playing nice with the Scions?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Just as you must,” Elidibus replied, glossing over what Emet-Selch had said to him only moments prior."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch, who had begun pacing languidly as the other man spoke, stopped to simply stare at him with a mixture of disbelief and disdain."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Us all, does it?” Emet-Selch repeated, a look of distaste so great on his face that one could believe he'd truly tasted his own words, and was spitting them back out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch could only shake his head, though more out of annoyance than outright denial of his question."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus remained quiet for long enough that Emet-Selch had dared to hope the conversation was over, but before he could take steps to leave, the Emissary’s voice soon rose to fill the emptiness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Such dramatics suit you little.” Emet-Selch waved his hand in a dismissive gesture as he continued to slowly pace about."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was at that moment Emet-Selch realized it was Elidibus’ mere presence that was grating, as even when the man relented and stepped down, it did not seem to soften the grimace on his own face—in fact, it may have grown."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So long as you extend the same courtesy to me.” Emet-Selch turned then, desperate not only to escape the delightful company of his colleague, but to get the much-needed shuteye his body craved."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Just by pure instinct I looked around the room, expecting to perhaps see Hades sitting at a desk and pouring over papers, already beginning his work so early in the morning while I’d slept."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Seemed Emet-Selch hadn’t yet given anyone the memo that I had woken up last night.“You’re awake!” Alisaie spat—literally—and I deftly dodged a piece of sandwich that flew out at me, laughing as her cheeks became the same shade as her hairband."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Utterly absurd,” Emet-Selch declared, no doubt voicing what was going through all of the Scions heads as well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He had come back to the Rising Stones soon after I awoke, and was already in an impatient mood due to me explaining I would wait until the rest of my companions arrived before I said what was on my mind.I had to hold back a smile, however, noting how similar his reaction was to the one in Elpis, when he had also received information about a differing timeline.I told them everything: How Zenos was working with Fandaniel, as Emet-Selch had told us earlier, and how they erected towers in order to gather enough aether to destroy all of the seals caging Zodiark on the moon."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You don’t mean to tell me you believe all this?” Emet-Selch turned to Krile in disbelief then, most likely due to the fact that he viewed her as the most intelligent among the Scions.\r\n\tOr that Fandaniel is in Asahi’s body?”At my words, Emet-Selch only crossed his arms and stared at me, as if he could find what he was looking for in my face.“Perhaps your dear Hydaelyn told you of Zodiarks condition and whereabouts.\r\n\tI refrained from mentioning how I had met myself in the past, as it didn't seem like crucial information to the situation at hand, but somehow I felt as if he had seen it anyway.Emet-Selch’s eyes moved rapidly behind their lids as I recalled the memories once more for his sake, hopefully drawing enough of whatever residual aether he needed in order to see what I had.Soon after I finished talking, I felt his aether retreat from my own, and his eyes shot open in anger.“How could Hermes have been such a fool?” he growled, as furious as if the events had only just transpired moments before.\r\n\t“You’re…not angry?”“Wait, we really beat him?” Alisaie chimed in now, looking to Emet-Selch with a look of both shock and pride.\r\n\tYou should jump timelines more often, if it means getting intel this valuable,” Thancred smirked in approval, and I couldn't help my surprise at him apparently taking no issue with my sudden closeness to Emet-Selch.“Indeed.\r\n\tMaybe they really did just give up.”“If Zenos and Fandaniel are truly conspiring to bring an end to Zodiark in order to usher in the Final Days, I have no doubt they still plan to do so,” Emet-Selch addressed her, and then turned to the whole room.\r\n\tI squeezed his hand harder, but Emet-Selch released it shortly after in order to raise his arms in a shrug.“If you so wish, I could simply not help you at all?” He suggested easily, looking round the room with a smug smile.\r\n\tCatch them unawares, speaking in hushed whispers about their nefarious plans?” Emet-Selch regarded the gunbreaker with exasperation.\r\n\t“It’s from Garlemald—the Imperial Palace, no less!”A stunned silence overtook the room as we all looked at one another, though it seemed Tataru wasn’t finished.“And the letter is addressed to Hades, and a…Persephone?” “I know Hades is another name Emet-Selch goes by, but…” Tataru continued, looking to the rest of the room in confusion.\r\n\tIf Emet-Selch was Hades, then I, as the companion whose memories he was trying to restore, must be Persephone.\r\n\tIn Emet-Selch’s time.”  We invite you, Hades and Persephone, as honored guests for this celebration!\r\n\tThere is nothing nefarious planned, though even if there were, what would the Warrior of Light and a powerfully unsundered specimen such as Hades have to worry about?\r\n\tEmet-Selch was already making noises of disgust before I’d finished, snatching the letter to look over once himself.\r\n\tIn stark contrast to Emet-Selch’s dark and displeased expression, Thancred was looking quite as if Starlight Celebration had begun early this year.\r\n\tThat they would lay their cards so bare may only prove to benefit us,” Y’shtola hummed, looking over to both me and Emet-Selch.\r\n\tWith Emet-Selch by my side—not to mention my own power—having them simply reveal what it is they planned to do in such a bold-faced way would not only save time, it also beat walking in circles, mulling over what they might be planning next.\r\n\t“You and Emet-Selch arriving should be sufficient to distract Zenos and his Ascian friend, while I take up my position in the shadows and gather any information I can.” Emet-Selch turned on the gunbreaker immediately, the look on his face expressing his disagreement before his words had the chance.\r\n\t“…Although that could have been worded better,” I cleared my throat before speaking up, shooting Emet-Selch a look from the side.\r\n\tBetween Zenos and Fandaniel, Emet-Selch and I will be able to handle whatever they throw at us.\r\n\t“How touching!” Emet-Selch’s voice droned from beside me, clearly anything but touched.\r\n\t“—is the only viable option.” Emet-Selch cut her off swiftly.\r\n\tIn response, Emet-Selch smiled down at her, not bothering to hide his amusement in the slightest.\r\n\t“As for the rest of you, I’m sure you don’t need me to point out that you would need much more than a third eye before you could walk unnoticed in Garlemald,” Emet-Selch addressed the rest of the room then, his smile darkening as he looked between them all, imploring.\r\n\tTo nobody’s surprise, Emet-Selch’s offer remained untaken.\r\n\tUnlikely as it was, I couldn’t help but ask as I followed alongside Emet-Selch, trying to keep up with his languid yet steady pace, seemingly undeterred by any snow that made me stumble and catch my step.\r\n\tBeing intimately familiar with Garlean policies (and considering he’d most likely made most of them) Emet-Selch had already created the proper identification for the two of us as Hades and Persephone—and one for Thancred, too—who had already separated from us and was no doubt already settled into the nearest tavern.\r\n\tDespite Emet-Selch’s insistence that his portals were leagues above Thancred’s stealth, the gunbreaker remained fast in his stance that some information was better goaded with the use of friendly conversation and a little drink.\r\n\tNot to mention, even though a mutual trust was forming between the two men—or a mutual tolerance, at the very least—the fact remained that Emet-Selch was still an Ascian, and Thancred would no doubt rather take the very rare opportunity to blend into Garlean society and gather intel using his own skills and listening with his own ears, rather than relying on the words of another.\r\n\tAs for the two of us, Emet-Selch informed me that he already had somewhere prepared where we could stay until the day of the ball.\r\n\tAt my question, Emet-Selch only looked to me with an amused sort of derision, as though he were disappointed in my intellect for even having asked such a question, and I swore I heard him laugh under his breath as I huffed in indignation.\r\n\tI was glad to have Emet-Selch’s arm behind my back steering me along with him, since it allowed me to freely crane my neck and look about at the scenery and people as much as I pleased, not having to worry about walking or bumping into anything or anyone.\r\n\tLost in my observations as I was, I failed to realize Emet-Selch beginning to slow his pace, and so the arm that had been guiding me along with him suddenly turned into a restraint as he stopped me in my tracks, turning me towards a house before us.\r\n\tI hadn’t realized how cold I’d been until I saw the promise of a warm hearth ahead of me, and I turned to Emet-Selch pleadingly, who was already shaking his head in exasperation and raising his fingers to snap.\r\n\t“Stubborn until the end, Hades…” I grumbled as I walked past him, though I couldn’t help the smile that came to my lips when he scoffed from behind me.\r\n\tAs I set my bag down on the bed, I only barely had time to register the fact that Emet-Selch stiffened in my peripheral before my eyes fell on an oil painting hanging within the room.\r\n\tI hadn’t realized how close I’d walked to the painting in my observation of it, until my fingers were gently tracing the dried brushstrokes of her face, and I felt Emet-Selch walk up behind me, remaining silent as he also examined the portrait.\r\n\tI’d had my suspicions it wasn’t Emet-Selch himself who’d furnished the house, and his words verified it.\r\n\tThe faces Emet-Selch saw upon teleporting into the throne room were not the ones he expected.\r\n\t“Well, seems the gang is all here,” Emet-Selch regarded the other only remaining Ascians with a mockingly pleasant smile, the venom clear beneath his words.\r\n\tAs if they did not want to risk having their little tea party in the Rift, lest Emet-Selch intrude upon their chatter.\r\n\tHe was unable to hide the slight start at Emet-Selch’s sudden appearance, and although his voice remained as impassive as ever, the edge to his body language said otherwise.\r\n\t“Emet-Selch,” was all he said, addressing the man as he turned to look at him in greeting.\r\n\t“It seems we've finally found something we agree on, Elidibus: the fact that neither of us expected to see the other here.” Emet-Selch observed with a smile that was slowly becoming more genuine by the moment, taking no small pleasure in his companions’ discomposure at his arrival.\r\n\tThe Emissary said nothing at that, but much to Emet-Selch’s ire, Fandaniel had enough words for the two of them combined.\r\n\t“If it isn’t the honorable Emet-Selch!\r\n\tThe smile Emet-Selch plastered on his face naturally became a sneer as he beheld the other man.\r\n\t“Is it not only common courtesy to extend an RSVP to such an awaited event?” Emet-Selch implored with a slight shrug, his arms crossed casually against his chest.\r\n\tHis arms were positioned as though he were dancing with an invisible partner, and as he leaned down to dip them, his eyes raised to meet Emet-Selch’s once more.\r\n\tInsufferable as he found him, Emet-Selch was loathe to feed into Fandaniel’s theatrics, and so he remained standing there with his arms crossed, knowing the other Ascian would elaborate even without being spurred on.\r\n\t“For the reunion of Hades and Persephone!” He continued, as Emet-Selch knew he would.\r\n\t“He is an Ascian, too.” Elidibus explained calmly, meeting Emet-Selch’s golden glare unflinchingly.\r\n\t“I did not realize every action of mine was to be classified as an Ascian endeavor,” Emet-Selch retorted, pinching the bridge of his nose and letting his shoulders fall into an exhausted slump.\r\n\t“Oh, going out to eat, are you?” Fandaniel chirped with a smile, forcing Emet-Selch to turn and acknowledge his existence once more.\r\n\t“An expert on what she has in her wardrobe, are you?” Emet-Selch asked, attempting to keep his tone even and slightly uninterested, lest he give Fandaniel the satisfaction of whatever reaction he’d been hoping to goad out of him.\r\n\tThe words hadn’t even finished leaving Fandaniel’s mouth before Emet-Selch was opening a portal once more, his charade of mild interest falling apart as he left the two of them in his haste to go to Persephone’s side.\r\n\tHe wasn’t sure what Fandaniel meant to accomplish, sending Zenos to her while the two of them were separated, but if Fandaniel was under the impression that Emet-Selch would hesitate in killing the great-grandson of Solus Zos Galvus, then he was sorely mistaken.\r\n\tGranted, nobody was forcing me to be in such a fancy and frou-frou dress boutique, but during the walk with Emet-Selch earlier through town—especially when we’d reached the higher class district—I'd come to the realization that the dress I’d packed for the ball was no different than the dresses these women were apparently wearing as everyday attire.\r\n\tAnd so what started as simply an afterthought, a way to pass the time while Emet-Selch went to talk with Fandaniel, turned into something I was genuinely beginning to enjoy as my fingers lightly trailed along the rich silks and fabrics.\r\n\tDid Emet-Selch think so, as well?\r\n\tI also thought to the reaction I might be able to tease out of Emet-Selch.\r\n\tI’d only taken a few steps out of the store, dress boxed and in a bag at my side, before Emet-Selch strode down the path and towards me.\r\n\tI noticed the edges of Emet-Selch’s coat and pants were covered in snow, signaling that he had been made to walk even before reaching me, and realized that must have also been part of why he’d been so on edge.\r\n\t“What did he do?” Emet-Selch asked immediately after we returned to his place, closing the door and looking me up and down as if I’d have any traces of mine and Zenos’ meeting on my body.\r\n\tEmet-Selch’s golden stare burned into me for what felt like an eternity, before he began shaking his head and allowed his shoulders to fall into their signature slouch once more.\r\n\tThey knew we were separated, and made sure to approach me at that moment,” I realized, and Emet-Selch lolled his head into a lazy nod as he stared into the fire.\r\n\t“It’s not like I haven’t dealt with Zenos before, though,” I noted, but the look Emet-Selch gave me assured me I was about to be knocked off my high horse.\r\n\tNot taken unawares in a dress shop, accompanied by not only his guards, but the entire population of Garlemald that supports him,” Emet-Selch finished with a casual shrug, giving me what I could only describe as a look.\r\n\t“Elidibus was there too.” Emet-Selch explained further, causing both my eyebrows and my body to shoot up as I leaned to look at his face.\r\n\tI couldn’t help but crack a smile at that—the irony that Emet-Selch would so despise the Ascian who is known to be smug and theatric.\r\n\t“And you won’t have to,” Emet-Selch heaved himself up from where he sat beside me, rolling out his shoulders this time as he looked down at me.\r\n\tI looked up to Emet-Selch then, watching me in satisfaction as the realization dawned on my face.\r\n\tWhen he first hears the call of Elidibus pulling him from the slumber he shares with Emet-Selch, Hythlodaeus has the same trouble as always.\r\n\tIt never helps that Hades’ coping mechanism is emotionally distancing himself from the hard parts of it all.\r\n\tBut it only takes a momentary glance at Hades’ expression to know he, too, was in the middle of a dream about another person.\r\n\t“Let me guess,” Emet-Selch responded with a gravelly voice and the contempt to fill at least one lifetime.\r\n\t“Emet-Selch, Azem.\r\n\tEmet-Selch knew what that meant of course.\r\n\tWhen Hythlodaeus and Emet-Selch hold in their hands the portrait made in the image of the Warrior of Light, the Hero of Eorzea, their breaths catch in their throats.\r\n\t“Indeed she did,” Emet-Selch said with barely veiled contempt.\r\n\tHythlodaeus had been given this position for so many reasons: he had been given the opportunity to become a member of the Convocation once before, he had showed his loyalty to his people, and his soul sight was beyond that of even Emet-Selch.\r\n\tElidibus soon left, and Emet-Selch sighed in frustration.\r\n\t“Come now, Hades.\r\n\tHades could not dwell, lest his march be ever more difficult.\r\n\t“Far be it from me to disrespect an old friend,” Emet-Selch responded with a small smile.\r\n\tEmet-Selch rolled his eyes as he raised his hand to snap his fingers.\r\n\tEmet-Selch had always been appreciative of that mind, but it had been their Azem that truly understood the stars in his eyes.\r\n\t“Goodbye for now, Hades” In their own ways, Hades and Hythlodaeus had done their best to pay homage to the memory of their fallen one.\r\n\tAnd it gave him time to gather intel, learn the weaknesses of his enemy, think of annoying things to say to Hades- those sort of thoughts flutter out of his mind when he happens to catch sight of her.\r\n\tIf Hades were here there was no doubt he would look at everything that wasn’t like her- but Hythlodaeus let a smile perk up on his lips as he let his fingers pluck cords into a melody he had once played for her.\r\n\tI want you to make Hades’ heart sing when you smile at him, even as he denies it.\r\n\t“The Warrior of Light does not deserve to hear her song,” Hades bit out the words bitterly.\r\n\tThe esteemed Emet-Selch had lived countless lives amongst the people of the Source, and he was tired of it.\r\n\tHythlodaeus had always had a sharp mind and a cool wit, something Hades had only despised about half the time when he was subject to it.\r\n\tBut Hades had been steeped in a millennia of resentment and loss.\r\n\tBecause while Emet-Selch would plot around the Warrior of Light and use them how they saw fit, Hythlodaeus would employ the tactic he had become so fond of in these last eons of ongoing existence: subterfuge.\r\n\tAnd honestly, Hades had no idea what his companion would do.\r\n\tThe difference between the two of them was that Hades had been the one to see her body lying torn and tattered at the foot of some awful abomination.\r\n\tOf course Emet-Selch could play his grandson like a violin and doing that helped him feel a little better.\r\n\t“How fare you on your duties, Emet-Selch?” the sound of Hythlodaeus’ voice caught him off guard.\r\n\t“I had not expected to see you so soon,” Emet-Selch.\r\n\tIt’s the solitary guard at night who fails to protect his post, the lovers hidden between the foliage, and the assassin who stands above them that provide the most insight.” Emet-Selch rolled his eyes.\r\n\tHades could see the deliberation on his face and knew immediately to be suspicious.\r\n\tEven earned a bit of their coin, gil I think it was, singing to them.” Emet-Selch crossed his arms.\r\n\t“Oh, you know me Hades.\r\n\tBut being as Emet-Selch was not in fact Elidibus and was instead Hades, he had a different response.\r\n\t“You played her a ballad?” Hades asked dryly.\r\n\t“The Warrior of Light does not deserve to hear  her  song,” Hades bit out the words bitterly.\r\n\tEmet-Selch did not feel like having an argument when the reality was that meeting the Warrior of Light was advantageous for their purposes.\r\n\t“He always did have a way of being utterly predictable,” Emet-Selch said in a tone that almost suggested he was disappointed.\r\n\tAny advantages would be instrumental in bringing the Eighth Umbral Calamity to fruition,” Emet-Selch was waving his hands as if he was explaining something that had been repeated thousands of times.\r\n\t“Given Elidibus’ preoccupation, it seemed necessary.” Emet-Selch furrowed his brows when he saw the new Azem chuckle.\r\n\tHythlodaeus had been plucking at strings when he looked up at Hades.\r\n\tShe asked me to teach her the song.” The look this incited on Emet-Selch’s face was one of utter exasperation.\r\n\tEmet-Selch was quiet.\r\n\tHythlodaeus knew Hades had to deny it.\r\n\t“It’s not her,” Hades repeated poignantly.\r\n\tWhen Hythlodaeus was gone and returned to his mission, Emet-Selch was stuck with his thoughts.\r\n\tYes, alone in his thoughts, Hades remembered the woman who spoke lovely words and the way she had smelled as she pressed her form to his.\r\n\tHe had anticipated it would take a great deal of time for her to have a moment, but he wasn’t going to say that to Emet-Selch.\r\n\tShe believed this to be a world with enough majesty to conquer the sorrow that captured the pain both he and Hades felt.\r\n\tHades had already seen her die.\r\n\tHe had remained around in the meantime, trying to glean whatever he could in the time before he returned to Zodiark’s realm and met with Emet-Selch once more.\r\n\tEmet-Selch could not help but grow more frustrated when Hythlodaeus had that reaction.\r\n\t“Must you really be so blase about it, Azem ?” Emet-Selch sighed.\r\n\tHythlodaeus’ smile changed almost imperceptibly, but Emet-Selch knew the difference.\r\n\tBut I am certain we can amend the situation with an idea of your choosing, Emet-Selch.” Emet-Selch made an indistinguishable complaining noise and then sighed.\r\n\t“Exactly what are you suggesting, Emet-Selch?” Hythlodaeus asked sincerely.\r\n\tIn his experience, Hades was happy to ‘go against the advice’ that he offered.\r\n\tAs in, the both of us?” Emet-Selch cut in rapidly, “Of course I mean the both of us!” In truth, Hades had loved their people and possessed a spirit capable of great empathy and kindness.\r\n\tEmet-Selch gave a small, barely discernible smirk.\r\n\tThe insinuation that Hades would have a strict limit to how much of the Eorzeans he could handle was not one that he was going to pretend to argue with.\r\n\tEmet-Selch let that half smirk remain plastered proudly on his lips.\r\n\tTo Emet-Selch, saying the word meant repeating a mantra that might one day come true.\r\n\tBut they both knew what it meant: no matter how many times Hades poured out his vitriolic hate for the Warrior of Light.\r\n\tEmet-Selch opened a swirling purple portal with a snap of his fingers.\r\n\tEmet-Selch had stolen most of the attention: what with the whole ‘founder of the Garlean empire’ credited to his name.\r\n\t“I am much more personable, though far less renowned than the esteemed Emet-selch,” he added with a flourish of his hand.\r\n\tEmet-Selch did not mince words well.\r\n\tEmet-Selch had a good point about honesty: being able to laude the fact that they came forth willingly and openly was a good method of diffusing many means of interrogation.\r\n\tThe side eye from Emet-Selch was intense.\r\n\t“The point being,” Emet-Selch said indignantly, “Is that we are here now.”  “I have been nothing but truthful,” Emet-Selch added in turn.\r\n\tBut it was not Emet-Selch who had earned the Warrior of Light’s scorn.\r\n\t“It’s not her,” Emet-Selch said blankly as they returned to the void of Zodiark’s domain.\r\n\t“Come now Hades,” Hythlodaeus said with a gentle smile.\r\n\t“It is  not her!”  Hades snapped.\r\n\t“You can’t deny Hades,” Hythlodaeus said with patience.\r\n\tHades was no longer facing him.\r\n\tHe put his hand on Hades’ shoulder and tipped his head forward, just enough to put his breath against the other man’s neck.\r\n\t“I don’t want you to get hurt,” Hades snapped again.\r\n\tHythlodaeus pulled his arm away and stepped away from Hades.\r\n\t“But Emet-selch.\r\n\tThe title made Hades flinch.\r\n\tBut Hades had to know how pointless the argument would be because of his own mistake- and it was fairly obvious what mistake he’d made- Both Emet-Selch and ‘Azem’ were hard to read, and they had intended it to be this way.\r\n\tHades confronts his bitterness and Hythlodaeus begins to realize his own.\r\n\tBut while he had done so, Hades found himself alone with the thoughts Hythlodaeus was forcing him to confront.\r\n\tFor Hythlodaeus, Emet-Selch had noticed that he was similar in many ways.\r\n\tBut it had been time that made Hythlodaeus capable of the same things Emet-Selch had been capable of; time had shed the man willing to pursue a leisurely life with the people he loved.\r\n\tPerhaps it was even worse: Hythlodaeus did not need to see them as Emet-Selch did to be capable of doing what must be done.\r\n\tIt was a reality that Emet-Selch did not think he would ever come to terms with.\r\n\tEven Emet-Selch did not have that level of sight, though at times it came close.\r\n\tBut where Hades had to disassociate the meaning of the lives of the Source and its fragment, Hythlodaeus kept his sanity by keeping another perspective.\r\n\tHades knew that at the deepest core of Hythlodaeus was a connection the three of them had shared.\r\n\tHythlodaeus had taken it upon himself to be a partner to Hades while also maintaining a hope that he could not.\r\n\tHades was fueled by both his contempt for this world and his love of the former.\r\n\tHades was bound by duty to his brethren and his world.\r\n\t“Hades?” he heard Hythlodaeus say.\r\n\tHis concentration broken, Emet-Selch looked to Hythlodaeus with a tired expression.\r\n\t“We are doing that now,” Emet-Selch sighed as his eyes slid to the side and shot a half lidded stare at his ‘associate’.\r\n\tIf Hythlodaeus couldn’t read Hades’ aether so clearly he would have been none the wiser.\r\n\tNow Hades was in a worse mood.\r\n\t“You’d do well to remember,” Emet-Selch said pointedly to Azem.\r\n\tThe worst of the arguing was that Hades was never arguing with Hythlodaeus.\r\n\tHe knew Hades was remembering a time when their Azem did something fantastical, something exhilarating.\r\n\tHades was wondering how the two could even be compared, when one of them shone so brightly with a thought and the other would be torn apart by the same radiance.\r\n\tProdding Hades about the subject was the only way to make him acknowledge it.\r\n\t“And when she breaks apart,” Hythlodaeus said in a voice soft enough to make Hades pause his furious ranting.\r\n\tHades is silent.\r\n\tHades does not reject it.\r\n\tHades’ eyes were downcast.\r\n\t“She will see the merit of Lord Zodiark’s ways,” he said with an intensity that begot the eons of suffering he had endured alongside Hades.\r\n\tHades reached into his pocket and pulled out an orange crystal and gazed at it.\r\n\tBut his conversation with Hades had prompted him to consider what he did next, to examine his options.\r\n\tEmet-Selch, of course, was completely fine and absolutely did not have a moment of emotional weakness in front of his partner.\r\n\tIf there had been a talent that Hythlodaeus, Hades, and their Azem had shared, it had been the astounding capability to pretend like absolutely nothing was bothering them even under tremendous strain.\r\n\t“If Emet-Selch and Azem have nothing better to do-” he heard her say in passing as he examined her spirit.\r\n\tIt did not escape the Scions notice that while Emet-Selch did much of the oblique and vague talking, he also spent a great deal of time watching ‘Azem’ interact with their hero.\r\n\tEmet-Selch’s gaze flickered away from him, but the Warrior of Darkness did not see it.\r\n\tWhen asked to help fend off an attack on their party by the scions, he had hoped a little better than Emet-Selch denying their first request.\r\n\t“While Emet-selch might be unwilling to lend his aid, I intend to keep my word.\r\n\t‘I’ve always been stunning, Hades.\r\n\tHis mind was on her question as the miqo’te led them to the nearby encampment- it had been Emet-Selch who knew the names of everything here.\r\n\tIf Hades would leave distance between them to remain true to their cause, Hythlodaeus would do all that he could to remind her of what she was.\r\n\tHades compared them all and found them wanting for his own reasons.\r\n\tI wanted to make sure that Hades still gets his time in the sun.\r\n\tHad Hades acted in his capacity as Emet-Selch and warned Elidibus of the dangers of Hythlodaeus’ current plans?\r\n\tEmet-Selch seemed to be limiting his time more graciously.\r\n\tIn a way Hythlodaeus thought it was appropriate, Hades was wont to separate himself from her in a matter of self defense.\r\n\tEulmore was an obstacle that his dear friend Emet-Selch had set up in the first place.\r\n\tDidn’t Emet-Selch already act in your presence?\r\n\tI am here to offer you aid.” Hythlodaeus knew Emet-Selch would be infuriated by the constant questioning, but he was deeply amused by all of it.\r\n\tI find the Eulmorans to be a sorry group.” He had to congratulate Hades on his work in the First, but he had been responsible for little of it.\r\n\tIt was a wonder just how much Emet-Selch had proven capable of when he was set to a task, but Hythlodaeus had always felt that way about his friend.\r\n\t“Are you suggesting you’d prefer Emet-Selch as your company?” Emet-Selch might flush deep red to know that she considered him more honorable than Hythlodaeus.\r\n\tHythlodaeus believed in Hades’ dedication to their duty more than any other.\r\n\t“I have given you far more than Emet-Selch has.\r\n\tHythlodaeus took the opportunity to do just as Emet-Selch implied would happen if they were not accommodating: he pretended to leave and took note of the Warrior’s room.\r\n\tOr would you truly prefer Emet-Selch?\r\n\tThere was no way she could remember the way Hades gave a half smile when he looked at her, hiding that burning affection behind the guise of disinterest.\r\n\tHades had been reluctant to do something like ‘write a song’.\r\n\tHe was embarrassed, Hythlodaeus could tell it even if he did not say it, but everytime that Hades overheard him repeating words that didn’t quite work he would assist the man.\r\n\tIt was the declaration of all the joy she brought, the song of his love for her, and the intertwining of his magic alongside Emet-Selch’s.\r\n\tAt least Emet-Selch is willing to-” Hades was dealing with it by denying that she was truly the real Azem, truly the woman both of them had loved so dearly that her death broke them into pieces, but him?\r\n\tEmet-Selch was wise to leave quickly, for now I fear each word might ruin the suspense of the act.” These words elicited a raised eyebrow and consternation as he stood.\r\n\tBut I thought ‘what if Hythlodaeus had to face Emet’s absolute heartbreak of seeing Azem is dead and not vaguely missing?’ So this is the origin of that concept.\r\n\tBut Emet-Selch had already lost enough to feel bitterness and duty as his only recourse.\r\n\t‘Ignore it,’ Hades told himself, ‘ignore it because she threw it all away and she’s not worth it to think about.\r\n\tHades was hardening his heart to all of the things around him, but she had struck at something core to him.\r\n\tThen what will we do after that Hades?\r\n\tTo every lover who has lost the ones they hold dearest?’ Hades was trying to remain calm, but she looked at him with an understanding he had not wished to betray to her.\r\n\tI will not call for you this time, Emet-Selch, as I know you will not answer me.\r\n\tHades’ breath stalled at the sight the blasphemy was obfuscating.\r\n\tHades walked with purpose towards her.\r\n\tHe was Emet-Selch and he had a duty to complete.\r\n\tHe was Emet-Selch, not Hades, and he was going to be the one who helped restore this world.\r\n\tHades did not weep.\r\n\tHades trembled and gripped his hand into a fist.\r\n\tWhen Emet-Selch returned to Amaurot with Azem’s mask, he wore the look of indignance and annoyance he seemed to wear each and every day.\r\n\tBut as more than Azem, as the third partner in their lifelong companionship, she had left Hades angry and himself powerless to change it.\r\n\tPart of him held hope that Azem would be convinced at the dissipation of the Final Days and return to Hades’ side.\r\n\tHades was running late, but Hythlodaeus didn’t mind.\r\n\tAnyone else might look and see a bad mood, but Hythlodaeus looked and saw sorrow beyond anything he had ever seen Hades feel.\r\n\t“Hades?” he had asked with concern.\r\n\tThe world was burning around them but it felt like Hades’ sorrow being expressed was the surest sign of the end.\r\n\tHades opened his mouth to speak.\r\n\tHades’ hands were trembling when he said the words.\r\n\tHades stayed still for a moment before he lifted a familiar mask from his robes.\r\n\tHythlodaeus watched Hades falter.\r\n\tHades, alone.\r\n\tHe would belong to the gestalt entity of the primal who would save them all, Azem would be born anew as a soul who did not know them, and Hades would suffer alone in misery.\r\n\tHe couldn’t leave Hades alone with her death.\r\n\tTheir story could not be over- he could not allow Hades to carry the burden of restoring everything with the loss of both of them.\r\n\tBut when Zodiark is born and the denizens of the star become bound to Zodiark’s will, what Hythlodaeus and Emet-Selch hope for is twisted like all others.\r\n\tHythlodaeus’ only comfort is knowing that the terrible burden of their great work will not fall squarely on Emet-Selch’s shoulders.\r\n\tHythlodaeus had always been logical, but he had a different way of doing things than Hades did.\r\n\tIt had been Hades who held onto an old anger, an old wound, and let the burning fire of that hurt scar him deeply.\r\n\tHe had no partner in crime to force Hades to surrender to happiness, and so that was a burden he carried alone.\r\n\tAll that was left was a mask that rightfully belonged to her, and a crystal that Hades had made to remember her.\r\n\tHades, with the obstinate will to hide the love he felt but never discard it no matter how betrayed he felt.\r\n\tHe did not regret his choice to stay with Hades.\r\n\tHe did not look forward to the conversation, but there was only one person who could stand in the way now that Hades seemed willing to let him seduce their Azem to his side.\r\n\t“For all these eternities Emet-Selch and I have labored, tell me, if we could convince her .\r\n\tThough the crystal Emet-Selch had forged held memories of what was dear to him, the heart of Zodiark had tried to remain a resolute figure whose abstract duty was what mattered more.\r\n\tLeast of all, Emet-Selch.\r\n\tStill, it had been auspicious that Emet-Selch seemed cowed by the viis, as if they had actually managed to get a handle on him.\r\n\tWhile Hythlodaeus had made an effort to create a jovial atmosphere, Emet-Selch seemed like a curmudgeon from the moment he had approached them.\r\n\tEven if he was going to let Hythlodaeus deal with the Warrior of Light in his own way, when left to his own devices Emet-Selch would not simply hold the ball and wait for Hythlodaeus to ask for it.\r\n\tHades couldn’t be bothered to give a damn about that.\r\n\tEmet-Selch could almost hear the laughter from Hythlodaeus now at his poor bedside manner.\r\n\tIt was not his pain, but hers, that made Emet-Selch hold his tongue.\r\n\t“Oh Hades, you are so compassionate and generous,” she had whispered into his ear as she was close, those lips that had grazed his skin remaining within a whisper of him.\r\n\tEmet-Selch knew she would not think those words now.\r\n\tEmet-Selch.” Urianger was polite in all he said, but it was Thancred’s reaction that made Emet-Selch smirk.\r\n\t“Yes, Emet-Selch.\r\n\tEmet-Selch?!\r\n\tEmet-Selch had underestimated how cross they would feel about his partner when deceptions were revealed.\r\n\t“How generous,” Emet-Selch addressed Thancred’s comments.\r\n\tDifferences notwithstanding, you saved my life, and for that I am grateful.” All Emet-Selch can do is shrug.\r\n\tThanks to his partner, Emet-Selch seemed almost noble.\r\n\t“Oh, he’s much too sensitive for a man willing to intrude on a stranger’s bedroom without an invitation.” Emet-Selch did not expect her to say that.\r\n\t” Emet-Selch says with a level of frustration he can’t quite convey with words.\r\n\tEmet-Selch pauses.\r\n\tI’m sure he’ll make more visits.” Truly, Hades recalled the moment that Hythlodaeus had asked her to call him just that.\r\n\tThough he will find little favor with me if he chooses to deceive me once again.” Emet-Selch looked at her and shrugged.\r\n\tHades kept a cool expression.\r\n\t“Emet-Selch?” her voice rang with curiosity.\r\n\tLong ago, he had known her as Hades before anything else.\r\n\tEmet-Selch shakes his head.\r\n\tI spent a good few days watching Shadowbringers cutscenes to get the feel of things, and I think Rak’Tika is so incredibly vital to establishing Emet-Selch that I wanted to cover it all in as much detail as I could.\r\n\tWatching the dumpster fire that is Hythlodaeus’ emotional manipulations while Emet-Selch goes ‘this is a bad idea and you know it but fine’ is probably one of the greatest trainwrecks I’m happy to be engineering.\r\n\tEmet-Selch relays his stories, and the Warrior of Light wonders what is true and what is merely a song.\r\n\tWhile Hythlodaeus had been on her mind, it as Emet-Selch who was skulking along towards them.\r\n\tEven the other Scions held more genuinely positive reactions towards the sullen Emet-Selch.\r\n\tBut how is the hero of the hour?” Emet-Selch’s eyes traced over her.\r\n\tIt made her recoil inwardly to think of Hythlodaeus and Emet-Selch’s emotions as anything more than manipulation.\r\n\tEmet-Selch merely shrugged, as if it was trivial and most understandable.\r\n\tEmet-Selch lifted his hand and motioned to murals as he began to explain them.\r\n\tAnd worse yet, if Emet-Selch was to be believed, a greatly important detail had been laid before them.\r\n\tOr..?” Emet-Selch looked at the entire party as he considered.\r\n\tEmet-Selch broke out into laughter.\r\n\tShe let her eyes follow Emet-Selch, trying to parse her feelings about the words that had been said.\r\n\tEmet-Selch had left the Scions to their machinations, but his mind was still a torrent.\r\n\t‘I would do anything for you, Hades’  a wistful memory of whispered affections fills his mind.\r\n\tEmet-Selch’s little pet project in Eulmore was keeping her busy, and so he had been able to keep up the act of a ‘bard’ on the frontlines of the war.\r\n\tHythlodaeus might not have the sheer power to influence the world as Emet-Selch did, but his strengths were not to be denied.\r\n\tNow that Elidibus and Emet-Selch had chosen to passively allow him to do as he wished, with the understanding that he would still be useful to their actual ongoing Rejoining operations, he had begun putting pieces together.\r\n\tEmet, I mean.\r\n\tThe shard from this world: one that Emet-Selch had no doubt meant to destroy ages ago.\r\n\tHad Hades known about this?\r\n\tThe Convocation was keeping Hades so busy that he would no doubt be displeased at a visit from Hythlodaeus.\r\n\tWhich was Hades’ way of saying ‘I’m glad to see you but I actually need to do work right now and no I do not mean I can do it later’.\r\n\tThe magic seemed to belong to Hades, but it was far from him.\r\n\t“And… you must have had Hades’ help you adjust it.\r\n\t‘Good work, Oh most Eminent and Illustrious Emet-Selch…’ the simple building blocks laid down by Hythlodaeus had apparently been used to their fullest.\r\n\t“Oh, believe you me, Emet-Selch barely lets me do what  I  want to do.\r\n\tIndeed, Hades had done better than he could hope.\r\n\tNo, he let no indication come through that he had almost wished Hades had left the miqo’te there.\r\n\tWith all of the groundwork laid, Emet-Selch was now endeared to them more than he would be otherwise.\r\n\tHad Hades felt a flicker of joy to see the visage of the one they both so loved so pleased with him?\r\n\tHythlodaeus had been attempting to coax that sort of joy from Hades: pushing him to accept the love he still felt.\r\n\t“He’s quite the man, Emet-Selch.\r\n\tHow badly had it hurt for her to ask Hades that?\r\n\tShe had known him as Hades long before she knew him as Emet-Selch.\r\n\tAt least, it would leave no doubt for Hades.\r\n\t“Emet-Selch says he is nothing but honest about his intentions, you say I’m right to suspect you.\r\n\tEmet-Selch has not lied about his intentions, but if I were you I wouldn’t simply lie back and trust my sworn enemies.\r\n\t“He told us an interesting story, Emet-Selch.\r\n\tEmet-Selch had said that before in the opposite direction.\r\n\tBut that made things more difficult: if he was genuinely surprised, it made her wonder if perhaps Emet-Selch had been more honest than she was comfortable admitting.\r\n\t“Emet-Selch has not lied about his machinations.\r\n\tFurther…Emet-Selch has not lied to you about this.” What would you do if your people were on the verge of the same calamity described to you by Emet-Selch?” Her brows were furrowed and her gaze was downcast.\r\n\tThe cold distance between herself and Emet-Selch had been comfortable enough that she had tentatively allowed bits and pieces of self to be exposed.\r\n\tEmet-Selch and yourself, I mean.” Lahabrea had used brute force, Emet-Selch seemed fond of the abstract sympathy, but Azem?\r\n\tEven Emet-Selch might miss the wisp of blue that puttered around the Warrior of Light, never joining her but glimmering in her presence.\r\n\tWhat Emet-Selch might say.\r\n\tWould Emet-Selch chagrin this world as all but the same compared to the mysterious home he claimed to have hailed from?\r\n\tOf course every single time she thought she had her feelings in check, those raging burning feelings that Hythlodaeus managed to stoke in her each and every time, somehow Emet-Selch knew when to appear.\r\n\tIt was rather fitting that no one but her seemed to give Emet-Selch the time of day.\r\n\tOnly Emet-Selch seemed to notice when her eyes lingered just a little too long on him, the connection of their gazes making the Warrior of Light direct her eyes precisely back at the Exarch.\r\n\tThancred walked towards the exist as they all faced Emet-Selch.\r\n\tThe Warrior of Light shot daggers at Emet-Selch.\r\n\tEmet-Selch raised his hands in a nonchalant shrug.\r\n\tHythlodaeus managed to pique her curiosity, but somehow Emet-Selch need only frown and say a few choice words to frustrate her and make her struggle to hide her displeasure.\r\n\tAs she left she wondered inwardly if she was taking out the frustration she couldn’t express to Hythlodaeus out on Emet-Selch.\r\n\tHer last mistake was to look back at Emet-Selch and allow herself to think.\r\n\tEmet-Selch’s words were hardly the thing that made this place worse: they just brought attention to another wound festering underneath its dressings.\r\n\tThose words were the truths of the matter, if not in a more kind state than Emet-Selch had been wont to deliver.\r\n\tIt was easy at first to blame Emet-Selch for the issues that had already existed.\r\n\tAt the losses she still had to face, the hardships her friends were forced to endure, and that damn self righteous look on Emet-Selch’s face as he made it worse.\r\n\tPerhaps you might ask Emet-Selch, as he seems to know everything.” Hythlodaeus’ eyebrow quirked up in curiosity.\r\n\t“My dear Warrior of Darkness,” he said a little too reverently, “did you call me here to complain about Emet-Selch?” In spite of it all she sat down next to him and met his gaze.\r\n\t“Oh Imminent Emet-Selch, already scorning the good favor you bring.\r\n\tI am metaphorically calling Emet-Selch a clown.\r\n\tShe had invited him here, whether it was ostensibly to complain about Emet-Selch or not, and she had not asked him to get off of her bed.\r\n\t“Well, I needed to complain about Emet-Selch,” she said slyly, diverting the topic away from that.\r\n\tWords were his greatest power, and this power had failed him many a time in a world where Emet-Selch and Azem wielded the essence of creation at their fingertips.\r\n\tWhat Hades acted out in passion and brusque actions the two of them accomplished with constant gentle prodding.\r\n\tEmet-Selch had occupied his time by completely ignoring the Warrior of Light and focusing instead on the Exarch.\r\n\tBut unlike the very friendly Hyur that hovered over the Oracle of Light, the Exarch was not wont to share his thoughts with Emet-Selch.\r\n\tAlways so guarded in our every interaction--interactions you curiously refrain from sharing with the Scions and their champion.” Emet-Selch had wondered after what might be the thing to make the Crystal Exarch speak, and it was bringing up his distance from the Warrior of Light that finally got a response.\r\n\tEmet-Selch did not let the way he mentioned their ‘budding relationship’ needle him.\r\n\t“Well, it seems we are both eager to fulfill our duties, then,” Emet-Selch said as his conversation with the Exarch drew to a close.\r\n\tAs a man, Hades knew leaving the man to his whims meant he would be in for a headache.\r\n\tHe could have rightfully stayed in the First and avoided Emet-Selch if what he had hoped for was privacy, so Hades suspected that was not what he wanted.\r\n\t“Why Emet-Selch,” Hythlodaeus said with an unreadable smile.\r\n\tEmet-Selch could feel the tension running through Hythlodaeus in ways it hadn’t in years.\r\n\tHades looked at him with a fair degree of incredulousness.\r\n\tHythlodaeus’ gaze was still somber, but Hades could make out other feelings in his aether.\r\n\tHades shook his head, grabbed Hythlodaeus’ hand, and snapped his fingers.\r\n\tHades looked at Hythlodaeus sharply, trying to dissect the way his emotions broiled in his aether.\r\n\tDo you remember what we were like together?” Hades found himself groaning at the thought.\r\n\tIt was a wonder when she wasn’t up to something against her code without finding you had helped her achieve it.”  Hades’ hand rubbed his temple as he thought of it.\r\n\tVivid imagery came to mind with each word, both for himself and for Hades.\r\n\tHades looked in Hythlodaeus’ eyes as he gently put his hands on the other man’s shoulders.\r\n\tAnd if you yearn for that person, then we must endeavor to speed along the Rejoining…” Hythlodaeus put his hand on Hades’, nuzzling into it with an expression that teased at the remaining arousal he felt.\r\n\t“What did you do?” the man who was Emet-Selch inquired hesitantly.\r\n\tHades looked at him.\r\n\t“This version of her is not nearly as beautiful-” Hades began his arguments.\r\n\tHades froze at that for a moment, and then crossed his arms.\r\n\t“I did nothing to deserve such scorn.” Hythlodaeus raised his hand and slowly caressed from Hades’ arm to his shoulder.\r\n\t“That hardly suggests she wants anything to do with me except to shrug me off,” Emet-Selch said dryly.\r\n\t“I kissed her,” he said as he brushed his finger over Emet-Selch’s lips.\r\n\tEmet-Selch looked incredibly astounded.\r\n\t“Are you going to  fuck  Hydaelyn’s puppet?” Emet-Selch asked in a tone that suggested this was incredibly frustrating.\r\n\t“Does that make you feel jealous, Hades?” Hythlodaeus joked affably.\r\n\tEmet-Selch’s lips twisted into an annoyed scowl.\r\n\tEmet-Selch was doing exactly what he wanted.\r\n\tAnd Hades did just that.\r\n\tThat was partially his fault: he had teased Hades to the point of the other man using that braid in his ‘punishments’.\r\n\tHades had his arm under Hythlodaeus and his hand softly holding his waist.\r\n\t“Hades,” Hythlodaeus said just as the man began to fall to sleep.\r\n\tOne of Hades’ eyes cracked open and his brow furrowed.\r\n\tHe propped himself up, leaning against Hades’ chest and taking the free hand at his side into his two hands.\r\n\tHades was silent for a moment.\r\n\tShe could not imagine the truth of it: that he was smugly planning on lording that over Emet-Selch in the future.\r\n\tThey reach the outpost and Emet-Selch speaks with Hermes outside the main office.\r\n\t“Come Meteion, we retire for the night.” Hermes calls some little while later, once the “grown ups” (as Emet-Selch put it) have finished talking.\r\n\tEmet-Selch frowns giving him a sudden sharp look.\r\n\tEmet-Selch scowls in her direction, such a familiar look on his passingly familiar face.\r\n\tAnd ever holding a hand to her and Emet-Selch.\r\n\t“That color is unmistakable and wholly unique, Hades.\r\n\tShe hears Emet-Selch scoff the sound of his boots crunching on the dirt as he walks away.\r\n\tBut I have the strangest feeling you’d rather the esteemed Emet-Selch be your guide.” Emet-Selch carries a lot of responsibility, which he takes seriously.\r\n\tAn image of Emet-Selch, different but similar, as he walks shoulder slumped, the weight of countless lives and worlds upon them, through the ghostly streets of an echo of his home hits her vividly.\r\n\tI hope I may know then one day, but for now…” Hythlodaeus sighs, and moves to catch up with Emet-Selch.\r\n\t“It’s all well and good to leave her behind, Hades, but what happens if the aether you gave her fades.\r\n\tEmet-Selch lets out his own long suffering sigh, “The aether I gave should be sufficient to last at least long enough to complete whatever goal it has.” This seems to give Emet-Selch pause, and he turns to glance back at her.\r\n\tHythlodaeus blinks, “Well, i’m not quite sure that’s what I was going for, but if it works.” He shrugs, and then makes sure to catch his friend’s gaze, “Be civil, Hades.\r\n\tEmet-Selch’s eyes roll extravagantly.\r\n\tWhat a fitting irony Emet-Selch had saved her from.\r\n\tI had her teleport in during that moment and disappear while everyone was distracted by the illustrious Emet-Selch’s arrival.\r\n\tEmet-Selch doesn’t say anything to indicate this isnt’ true.\r\n\tEmet-Selch waves a hand, “Hermes is well aware of Xelinah’s existence as our… companion.\r\n\tAnd Emet-Selch tagging on that bit about the lykaones at the end was masterful.\r\n\tEmet-Selch’s already turned away before the man has even finished with his farewell dialogue, with a dismissive wave of his hand.\r\n\tThe crystal she is attuned to, is not from the actual Amaurot, but Emet-Selch’s future echo of the fallen city.\r\n\tEmet-Selch scoffs.\r\n\tWith another of his patented sighs, Emet-Selch gestures.\r\n\t“If you’re sure.” He straightens up, turning to Emet-Selch, “I’ll go on ahead.\r\n\tShe hadn’t even considered at this point that they may cross her paths, aside from Fandaniel himself and of course Emet-Selch now.\r\n\t“And now it’s just you and me.” Emet-Selch murmurs.\r\n\tThis isn’t the Emet-Selch she’s built a tenuous rapport with.\r\n\t“You nearly let yourself get swallowed by my aether!” Emet-Selch is scolding her somewhere in the distance, but it seems far away.\r\n\tIn a way her existence is inextricably linked with Emet-Selch for the time being.\r\n\t“Find yourself, did you?” Emet-Selch asks.\r\n\t“My sincerest apologies, Xelinah,” Hythlodaeus says, lowering his mask slightly to catch her eye, “I should have considered what teleporting with Emet-Selch might have meant with your form being sustained on his aether.\r\n\tEmet-Selch shakes his head, pushing past them and starting down one of the paths.\r\n\tThe ride up is near silent as Emet-Selch leans on one side of the lift, opposite the other two.\r\n\tHe and Emet-Selch stare at one another, sharing looks that she cannot read.\r\n\tHythlodaeus chuckles, “Oh I have had my share of sleepovers with the illustrious Emet-Selch, but I do have business to be getting back to .Worry not, my friend, for we will see each other again.\r\n\t“My abode is right here,” Emet-Selch interrupts before they can say anything else, “The door isn’t locked, feel free to go inside.\r\n\tShe nods and with a glance back at them makes her way to the door of Emet-Selch’s apartment.\r\n\tHades stares at him as if searching for something sarcastic to respond with but instead sighs.\r\n\tHades may or may not like her, that’s up in the air as far as Hythlodaeus is concerned, but he’ll make sure she’s protected and gets what she’s looking for.\r\n\tBut once Hades had poured his aether into her, it became clear that wasn’t quite it.\r\n\tHe is certain however that she has some connection to Azem, more than Hades ever could be.\r\n\t“You’re not wrong.” Hades says, “I can’t deny that there seems to be some connection to Azem, no matter how thin it might be.\r\n\tThough he always knew Hades saw what he did, it’s still nice to hear him say it.\r\n\tHades rolls his eyes upward.\r\n\tHythlodaeus raises an eyebrow, “You mean like you are?” Hades Sneers and Hythlodaeus doesn’t push.\r\n\tHades casts his eyes downward and Hythlodaeus instantly feels a little guilty.\r\n\tHades is brash and blunt when things don’t go his way, when it seems like someone might actively be working against him.\r\n\tHades is not a cruel person at heart however.\r\n\t“I imagine by that point we’ll both be glad of your company if we haven’t driven each other mad.” Hades crosses his arms almost petulantly.\r\n\tHades barks out a laugh.\r\n\tXelinah will be okay, and so will Hades.\r\n\tAs Emet-Selch with his skill he’s in a far better position to help her achieve her goals.\r\n\tShe has absolutely no frame of reference for what sort of home Emet-Selch might live in.\r\n\tEmet-Selch actually had a number of plants throughout the apartment.\r\n\tHaving lived through Emet-Selch’s all too real recreation of the final days had been bad enough, but then actually living through them in her own time, more visceral, made all of it all the more real.\r\n\tEmet-Selch, Hythlodaeus, and in the middle Azem.\r\n\tEven Emet-Selch, who while still looking somewhat hassled, has a fond smile on his face that she’s caught a glimpse of a couple times today.\r\n\tShe’s about to turn to face Emet-Selch when a voice sends alarm bells ringing.\r\n\t“Hades?\r\n\tIt hadn’t been Emet-Selch coming in.\r\n\tWhat someone like Emet-Selch sees in her.\r\n\t“Why is my door wide open?” Comes Emet-Selch’s annoyed voice Emet-Selch makes a brief humming noise.\r\n\t“No.” She laughs then, good natured, “Aww, Hades.\r\n\t“I would hardly use the word friend.” Hades scoffs Emet-Selch will tell Azem all about her, probably bring her out to show her.\r\n\tXelinah imagines them staring at one another, imagines Azem must be weighing her chances of getting answers out of Emet-Selch.\r\n\tEmet-Selch sighs, this time sadly, “I’m sure you will, my dear.” “Take care Hades.” “You can come out now.” Emet-Selch calls after the silence stretches on.\r\n\tShe still has the photo in her hands, and Emet-Selch’s eyes immediately fall on it, then move back to her.\r\n\tEmet-Selch regards her cooly.\r\n\t“Thank you, Emet-Selch.” Emet-Selch, hardly being the chivalrous type, as he himself readily told her, set her up on the couch with a plush black blanket and probably the most comfortable pillow she’s ever put her head on.\r\n\tEmet-Selch’s voice sends an involuntary shudder through her, but she swallows and ignores it.\r\n\tEmet-Selch tilts his head and shrugs again, “Not particularly.\r\n\t“Thank you for your esteemed wisdom oh honorable Emet-Selch.” Not to mention Hythlodaeus isn’t here to mediate or placate Emet-Selch.\r\n\tEmet-Selch makes a sound of agreement.\r\n\tEmet-Selch enjoys baked goods.\r\n\tEmet-Selch watches as she gathers her hair, binding it slightly off center, then twisting the braid around the binding.\r\n\t“You know…” Emet-Selch starts, glancing away out the window himself, “It would be much easier if you kept your hair down, or at least not bound so high.\r\n\tShe is in the middle of a set of squats when Emet-Selch reemerges, giving her the oddest of looks.\r\n\tEmet-Selch too glances at her spear resting against the wall.\r\n\t“Color me surprised,” Emet-Selch mutters flatly, before turning and moving in the direction that would lead them to the town center.\r\n\tEmet-Selch balks at the question.\r\n\tMany people greet Emet-Selch as they pass, and though a few try to stop him for a chat he politely declines claiming he has urgent business.\r\n\tIt seems Emet-Selch is a regular and has a usual to-go order.\r\n\tEmet-Selch opens his mouth to say something but someone else answers first.\r\n\t“And good morning to you Hythlodaeus,” Emet-Selch greets their friend entirely unenthusiastically.\r\n\t“Hmph.” Is all the Emet-Selch has to say on the matter.\r\n\t“I wouldn't deign to call them ‘adventures’” Emet-Selch states, familiar disdain dripping from the last word.\r\n\t“Far too cheery,” Emet-Selch mutters to himself “They do have their ways of never letting you alone.” Emet-Selch relents, in his own gesture of sentimentality.\r\n\tBeing with Emet-Selch she doesn’t need a writ of passage to enter the capitol building, earning barely even a spare glance from those around them.\r\n\tEmet-Selch however is greeted by just about everone they pass.\r\n\tEmet-Selch nods, but hesitates before doing so, giving her a once over.\r\n\tEmet-Selch stops at the second door they come to, which stands open, and knocks on the doorframe.\r\n\t“Oh do away with the formalities, Emet-Selch.\r\n\tXelinah peeks around Emet-Selch as they enter the office.\r\n\tWith all that Xelinah almost expects her to be short, but the woman is taller than her, though shorter than Emet-Selch or Hythlodaeus.\r\n\tEmet-Selch smiles wryly, “He’s thinking it over.\r\n\tShe takes a moment to study her before looking back at Emet-Selch.\r\n\t“Insightful as ever,” Emet-Selch replies, practically pulling the thoughts from Xelinah’s mind, “Azem, as it would seem.\r\n\tShe shuts the door as Emet-Selch takes a seat.\r\n\tGetting comfortable it would seem means removing hood and mask, as Emet-Selch does so.\r\n\tEmet-Selch sighs.\r\n\tEmet-Selch explains.\r\n\tEmet-Selch frowns.\r\n\tEmet-Selch snorts, “And yet, isn’t that where some decide they have come up with their life’s thesis?” “No, and thank all that is good for that.” Emet--Selch says with a scowl.\r\n\tEmet-Selch and the unsundered ascians being a prime example.\r\n\tFandaniel glances at Emet-Selch, who shrugs.\r\n\tEmet-Selch groans.\r\n\t“I’m not his keeper, Emet-Selch.” Her tone is sharp, and Emet-Selch takes the hint.\r\n\t“I think that’s all,” Xelinah says, looking to Emet-Selch who nods in confirmation.\r\n\t“Do you really think Lahabrea will be able to help?” she asks Emet-Selch as they walk down the halls that he knows like the back of his hand.\r\n\tShe may have an uninformed, biased opinion of Lahabrea, and Emet-Selch’s own distaste isn’t exactly an indicator of character considering how he treats just about everyone it seems.\r\n\tNot that she thinks she’ll need to rush out of here in a hurry, or that Emet-Selch will even let her be on her own, but she’d much rather know where she is than not.\r\n\tUnlike before Emet-Selch does not knock politely.\r\n\t“My most venerated Emet-Selch, you know I love nothing more than theoretical banter.\r\n\tEmet-Selch steps into the office then and Xelinah steps in after, taking a cue from their last conversation and shutting the door behind her.\r\n\tXelinah can hear the eye roll in Emet-Selch’s reply.\r\n\tFrom what she’s been able to learn, she imagines that Lahabrea would have no qualms about asking Azem about her familiar following Emet-Selch around.\r\n\tHe removes his mask, so Emet-Selch can see the mild amusement in his eyes at this turn of events.\r\n\tEmet-Selch’s mouth twists downward at being called out like that.\r\n\tShe glances at Emet-Selch who sighs, “Is this really necessary, Lahabrea?” Emet-Selch sighs again and shrugs at her.\r\n\tXelinah scowls, and despite Emet-Selch’s warnings removes her mask in an act of stubborn defiance, making sure to meet Lahabrea’s stare with a glare of her own as she does so.\r\n\tAnd you’ll have to correct me if I’m wrong, Emet-Selch, as I don’t possess your sight.\r\n\t“You do.” Emet-Selch responds grudgingly, gritting his teeth.\r\n\tEmet-Selch scowls at the implication, waving a hand dismissively.\r\n\t“Assuming an area already depleted of aether of course,” Emet-Selch adds.\r\n\t“Not really,” she mutters at the same time Emet-Selch snorts.\r\n\t“Is no one going to get over that” Emet-Selch exclaims.\r\n\tIt’s Emet-Selch’s reaction.\r\n\tEmet-Selch had looked at her the same way when she’d put it to him.\r\n\t“That’s quite enough, Xelinah!” Emet-Selch’s sharp reprimand cuts her off and she automatically shuts her mouth, though she glares up at him.\r\n\t“I don’t know where you found her, Emet-Selch, but I’d be careful with her.\r\n\tEmet-Selch stands, limbs tense, mouth set into a thin line.\r\n\tEmet-Selch too is staring at the flower.\r\n\tThis is an Emet-Selch she’s familiar with Thank you for all your help, oh eminent Emet-Selch, but I’ll find my answers on my own, just like you wanted.\r\n\tUntil she’s sure Emet-Selch won’t be down below looking for her.\r\n\tOf course with the time and distance she’s managed to calm down, and so of course feels every bit as foolish as Emet-Selch had accused her of being.\r\n\tThough doing so without Emet-Selch and Hythlodaeus there with her this time feels emptier, they were never supposed to be there to begin with.\r\n\tThe creature’s unclear connection with Azem aside, Hades isn’t going to put himself on the line for her mysterious agenda.\r\n\tIn fact, Hades would be more concerned with Hermes being in such a faction than this faux familiar.\r\n\tWith a sigh of frustration, Hades gazes down the street, eyes scanning over all the different hues and tints of the souls going about their daily lives.\r\n\tHe would have likely found her by now, able to see far wider and clearer than Hades can.\r\n\tWhile some would argue that all souls are unique, and Hades wouldn’t disagree with that statement.\r\n\tWhich means Hades is stuck here too.\r\n\tHythlodaeus is working after all, and Hades isn’t… well he isn’t either of the other two, who just like the barge in, busy or not.\r\n\tHaving permission Hades pushes the door open, already reaching up to pull his mask off.\r\n\t“Hades!” Hythlodaeus smiles at him, his own mask set on the desk.\r\n\tHades sighs.\r\n\tHades nods, moving to flop in the chair in front of the chief’s desk, letting some of his tension go.\r\n\tSometimes keeping up appearances and being Emet-Selch is exhausting.\r\n\tDid you scare her away, Hades?” It’s teasing, but Hades’ huffs and looks away.\r\n\tHythlodaeus sighs now, eyes drifting to look beyond Hades.\r\n\tAt least it means he’s taking this seriously, but Hades never doubted that he would.\r\n\tHades rolls his eyes.\r\n\tHades holds a hand up, “That would be the way of it, yes.\r\n\t“Do you think we can let it go, Hades?” It’s back at Emet-Selch’s apartment.\r\n\tThis had been what Emet-Selch had expected her to be able to do.\r\n\tThe only pressing matters she has is to decide whether to return to Elpis, or to Emet-Selch.\r\n\tAnd while Emet-Selch had adjusted her height somewhat, she still seemed to be shorter than the average Amaurotine.\r\n\tIt’s bad enough when Emet-Selch as the supposedly evil villain treats them as nothing more than things to be discarded.\r\n\tUnsurprisingly, Emet-Selch is with him, not hurrying over.\r\n\t“What on Etheirys happened to you?” Emet-Selch asks as they stop in front of them.\r\n\t“Emet-Selch!” Iris squeaks, recognizing the convocation mask and bowing her head respectfully.\r\n\tShe should never have overreacted, never have run off, she should have found Emet-Selch sooner and apologized.\r\n\t“Of course she did,” Emet-Selch huffs, almost too quiet to hear.\r\n\tWith a sigh Emet-Selch looks over at Thaumas, “Yes, she is.” He technically doesn’t state which of them she belongs to, but as he is the one who said, it leaves no room for argument.\r\n\t“I, for one,” Emet-Selch starts, “Will take any and all apologies she’s willing to give.\r\n\t“Come now, Hades, she protected the girl.” “Tch.” Emet-Selch clicks his tongue, but seems to relent.\r\n\t“Let us return to Emet-Selch’s home, then.” Emet-Selch opens his mouth to protest but one look from Hythlodaeus silences him.\r\n\t“I can’t imagine how you get through life with such little aether.” Emet-Selch shakes his head.\r\n\tNot by much, but enough that by the time they reach the building they turn to wait for her, Emet-Selch sighing.\r\n\tEmet-Selch looks back at her, golden eyes now visible.\r\n\tWith a snap of his fingers an array of first aid supplies, and a bowl of water appear on the table, and Emet-Selch drags a chair over to sit in front of her.\r\n\t“This is what I get for trying to be nice?” Emet-Selch asks, a slight pout on his face.\r\n\t“Protecting others, no doubt.” Emet-Selch says with an edge of bitterness.\r\n\tEmet-Selch continues cleaning the blood off her, still unbelievably gentle.\r\n\tOnce he’s cleaned most of the blood from her, Emet-Selch begins bandaging her remaining wounds.\r\n\tBut I recommend you do not do as you please.” Emet-Selch gives her a look, that might normally have been annoyed, but actually seems more concerned.\r\n\tHe’s far more insightful and discerning than Emet-Selch.\r\n\t“Emet-Selch handed this to me earlier.\r\n\tI do suggest that maybe we keep the Hydaelyn aspect from Emet-Selch for now.\r\n\tIt does mean that she gets to hear plenty of stories about Emet-Selch.\r\n\t“Honestly the person you speak of is so far from the Emet-Selch I’m familiar with.\r\n\tShe watches him disappear into Emet-Selch’s bedroom, curiously.\r\n\tBetween the concern at having lost their strange new friend, to the worry over her injuries, his own particular concern over the amount of scars across her body, and Emet-Selch’s general bad attitude, it had been nothing short of a feat to resolve things pleasantly.\r\n\tAs much as Hades loved his sleep, he is always so restless when things are outside his control.\r\n\tHades rolls over to regard him, “You haven’t been a ‘guest’ here in eons.” Hades' eyes roll up toward the ceiling.\r\n\tHe knows what Hades is asking him and playing dumb will only serve to irritate him.\r\n\tHades turns his head with a scowl, “Of course it can.” He then glances away once more with a sigh.\r\n\tWhat makes you think I’ve been ‘won over’?” Now it’s Hades’ turn to prop himself up to look at Hythlodaeus.\r\n\tHades scoffs, “Hardly.\r\n\tThe point is Hades, that she is obviously far more than any familiar.\r\n\t“A lizard person,” Hades mumbles, but there is no malice behind his words.\r\n\t“A cute lizard person,” Hythlodaeus agrees, finally snuggling into Hades.\r\n\tWith a resigned sigh, Hades puts an arm around him, pulling him closer.\r\n\tXelinah manages to lift her head and meet Emet-Selch’s delighted, smug gaze.\r\n\tOnly the image shifts after a moment, and instead of staring into the visage of Solus Zos Galvus, it’s Emet-Selch as he truly is.\r\n\t“Another nightmare?” Comes Emet-Selch’s voice as he exits the bedroom.\r\n\tHythlodaeus frowns once more, glancing in Emet-Selch’s direction.\r\n\tEmet-Selch shrugs, “It would seem she has them often.\r\n\tEmet-Selch rolls his eyes, a cup of steaming coffee already in his hands.\r\n\t“Better?” Emet-Selch asks the wall.\r\n\tEmet-Selch sighs.\r\n\t“I certainly won’t protest,” Emet-Selch shrugs, “Though I had half a mind to have her sit in on the lecture.\r\n\t“To sit in on the most honourable Emet-Selch’s lectures, truly the chance of a lifetime!” Hythlodaeus clasps his hands together with a look of mock bliss on his face.\r\n\tEmet-Selch rolls his eyes extravagantly, then looks at Xelinah, a hint of a smile on his face.\r\n\tEmet-Selch holds his hand out in a shrug.\r\n\tHe flicks them briefly to Emet-Selch who seems like he could not care less which she picked.\r\n\tBut she is interested in potentially watching Emet-Selch teach, watching him in his daily life as a normal person.\r\n\t“Perhaps you’ll actually get something accomplished,” Emet-Selch tells him smugly.\r\n\tTrailing behind Emet-Selch, attempting to keep up with his long strides, Xelinah wonders if this is what it was like to attend the studium in Sharlayan.\r\n\tWe don’t need you getting lost.” Emet-Selch calls to her, with a glance over his shoulder as they approach the doors.\r\n\tXelinah tries to keep track of where they are going as Emet-Selch leads her down the maze of hallways, and in between buildings.\r\n\tIt’s a theory at least, and maybe, maybe she might ask this Emet-Selch if he thought it possible to create something like that.\r\n\tOf course letting herself get lost in her thoughts, comparing the real past to the echoes of the future, she loses sight of Emet-Selch, having no idea which of the three buildings ahead he entered.\r\n\tIt could be another one they have to pass through before reaching the ‘Words of Emet-Selch’ “Emet-Selch’s” she answers.\r\n\tThe person turns back to her, mouth dropping open for a moment, “Em--Emet-Selch?\r\n\tWhile Emet-Selch himself is prone to being late, he doesn’t accept tardiness from others.” She does catch the writing on the plaque reading “Words of Emet-Selch”.\r\n\tThe Words of Emet-Selch remind her a lot of the crystarium, and rooms within the tower in particular - like the Occular.\r\n\tNot far down the hallway was an open doorway where she could see Emet-Selch leaning up against the frame.\r\n\tEmet-Selch glances off into the distance.\r\n\t“Hmm.” Emet-Selch leans his head against the doorframe, then turns her to her.\r\n\tWhen she opens her eyes, she finds Emet-Selch staring at her.\r\n\t“I rather think Azem would agree with you.” Emet-Selch states curtly.\r\n\t“And what praytell, does he mean by that?” Emet-Selch hisses at her.\r\n\tEmet-Selch’s room was decked out in that same purple, but more carpeted instead of marble, giving it a more comforting feeling.\r\n\tOff to one side is a desk, likely reserved for Emet-Selch himself.\r\n\tShe follows Emet-Selch down the steps toward the bottom unsure if she should be sitting somewhere or not.\r\n\tIt was only after Hythlodaeus had pointed out that Akademia Anyder had its share of dangers that Emet-Selch relented under the condition that he hold onto her weapon.\r\n\tThough she had been assured it had just been reverted to its natural aether, and Emet-Selch could call upon it at a moment’s notice, it still rubbed her the wrong way.\r\n\tBut at least, as long as she was with Emet-Selch, she would have access to it.\r\n\t“Well, I trust everyone is ready to get started,” Emet-Selch says, his voice amplified across the room.\r\n\tBut,” here Emet-Selch holds up a finger, “Might there theoretically be other forms of energy out there?\r\n\tXelinah is giving Emet-Selch a curious look.\r\n\t“No?” Emet-Selch asks, crossing his arms and surveying the rows before him, “No one has any ideas?\r\n\tEmet-Selch’s head turns that direction and Xelinah doesn’t need to see his eyes to know the disdain written in them.\r\n\t“Th-That wasn’t what I--” Emet-Selch cuts the student off with a wave of his hand.\r\n\tAt this Emet-Selch smiles.\r\n\t“Ah, young Idas, I was wondering when we might hear from you?” Emet-Selch gestures for him to speak.\r\n\t“Today,” Emet-Selch continues, “We are going to be learning about the theoretical concept of dynamis, and where it might exist in our world.\r\n\tEmet-Selch sighs.\r\n\tSilence fills the room once more, and Emet-Selch surveys each and every one of them before moving on.\r\n\tAs Emet-Selch has said,” she finds after the first couple words her voice grows loud enough to be heard all the way in the back.\r\n\tEmet-Selch scoffs.\r\n\tXelinah shrugs, glancing back toward Emet-Selch, who also shrugs.\r\n\tI imagine it must be, as its been blooming in Elpis for some time it would seem.” Emet-Selch answers.\r\n\t“Indeed a curious development,” Emet-Selch agrees, immediately garnering everyone’s attention.\r\n\tHer heart skips a beat when Emet-Selch’s intense golden gaze crosses her mind, but she immediately shoves it aside.\r\n\t“Alright, alright, that’s quite enough.” Emet-Selch announces with a pronounced snap of his fingers.\r\n\tEmet-Selch spreads his arms, “Why indeed?\r\n\tOnce again she’s reminded of the ocular, of Emet-Selch “borrowing” it’s functions.\r\n\t“Founder’s day,” Emet-Selch says, a light, rare smile gracing his features, “One of the city’s most joyous occasions.” In the street a procession of vehicles appear.\r\n\tEmet-Selch looks her direction with a knowing smirk, flowers appearing in the simulation lining the route.\r\n\tEmet-Selch waves a hand and snaps his fingers, “Let’s try another scenario, shall we?” When a long moment passes without anyone saying anything Emet-Selch steps forward.\r\n\t“Oh,” Emet-Selch adds, “Idas and Adromeda if you would stay behind?” Emet-Selch smiles and Xelinah wonders if they’ve reached whatever conclusion he clearly wants them to reach.\r\n\t“Another inquiry,” Emet-Selch says, “I didn’t want to bring it up during class, because it’s a little in depth for an introductory lecture, and I don’t plan on delving any deeper into the subject.\r\n\tEmet-Selch shrugs, “This is all purely hypothetical, of course,” he reminds them.\r\n\tAndromeda dips her head, “I thank you for the kind words, Emet-Selch, and I will take them to heart.” “As always, thank you for the enlightening lesson, Emet-Selch.” Idas then dips his head to her, “And twas a pleasure meeting such a unique familiar such as yourself.” “So, did you manage to learn something?” Emet-Selch asks, once they’re alone.\r\n\tThere is no way someone as closed off as Emet-Selch would do all that if he had zero faith in her to begin with.\r\n\tI am of the firm belief that Y'shtola and Emet-Selch could have been friends given the chance.\r\n\tI hope you all enjoyed School days with Professor Emet-Selch!\r\n\tFollow me @ariescantus for more updates, sneak peeks, discussion, FFXIV raving (spoilers spoilers everywhere) and even alternate characters (to give Emet-Selch new ways to torture whole new WoL's) This time there is no remnant of Emet-Selch’s soul to save her, no matter how hard she wishes on the stone held far too tightly in her fingers.\r\n\tRepeating the gesture with the other hand Emet-Selch and Hythlodaeus appear, also bound in a similar fashion.\r\n\tThe world with your precious Emet-Selch, where you don’t matter, though how you long to do so.\r\n\tShe looks toward the past, where Emet-Selch white hair and all too golden eyes glares her direcion.\r\n\tNot even Emet-Selch, and not even Azem.” He gives her an almost pointed look as he says the last part, as if he has it all figured out.\r\n\tI’m more than familiar with those who would rather avoid their burdens.” His eyes drift toward the door of Emet-Selch’s room, “And I am more than happy to lend an ear, if you find it something you’re able to share.” Emet-Selch hasn’t exactly warmed up to her, per se, but his snide remarks are starting to feel less barbed.\r\n\tEmet-Selch had plenty of snarky comments for his friend about wasting his time about the apartment like a homemaker.\r\n\t“As you are spending the day with me, we could very well leave the illustrious Emet-Selch to sleep in as I’m sure he would prefer.\r\n\tBut Hythlodaeus’ easy going smile and the ever enduring curiosity Emet-Selch holds for her wins out and she takes the mug, letting it warm her hands.\r\n\tEmet-Selch’s form lies still on the bed, half under the covers,his arm resting over the pillow.\r\n\tReaching up, Emet-Selch takes hold of her hand, lacing her fingers with his.\r\n\tTugging at her hand she swallows, “Emet-Selch….” I know where it is, after all.” She really doesn’t want to wait around for the fall out, or even sit through the banter if for some wild reason Emet-Selch decides to pretend as if nothing happened.\r\n\tEmet-Selch’s boost seems to be fading, and her already borrowed time seems to be running out.\r\n\tResisting the urge to crawl back into bed and pull the covers over his head Hades glares at the steaming mug on the bedside table as if it were the lizard girl herself.\r\n\tHis troublesome friend is staring toward the door where Hades imagines Xelinah must have disappeared from.\r\n\tHe is unsurprised at Hades’ presence and probably sensed him as soon as the door opened.\r\n\tHades scowls, recalling how he had taken her hand.\r\n\t“Don’t you look at me like that,” Hades admonishes, shaking a finger before coming in to sit at the table where breakfast is indeed waiting.\r\n\tHades mirrors his raised brows for a different reason.\r\n\tIt would be easy enough for her to conclude one,” here he gives Hades a pointed look, “might consider her a pale imitation of the ‘real thing’.” Hades shrugs.\r\n\t“No one likes being compared to others, Hades.” He drops his hands to tap a finger on the table in thought.\r\n\tBesides, while he’d been goading him, Hythlodaeus is far more liable to get answers from her than Hades is.\r\n\tShe never got this time with him in the future, not like Emet-Selch, or even the other two to an extent.\r\n\tSurely Emet-Selch’s Amaurot would fade with Elidibus’ death, and no one else capable of upholding the magic to keep it alive.\r\n\tTherefore despite Emet-Selch’s grumblings it would be strange for her to try to look like a normal citizen.\r\n\tShe still kept the mask with her, as it made Emet-Selch feel better and made for a quick disguise as she had learned.\r\n\tShe wonders, imagines really, that at that point Hythlodaeus would find a way to contact Emet-Selch to come “collect his wayward concept” or some such.\r\n\tNo, this one is Emet-Selch’s charge.” He hadn’t outright stated that she was Emet-Selch’s familiar, just his ‘charge’.\r\n\t“I gave my approval, pending Emet-Selch’s evaluation.” Pursing his lips, Elidibus crosses his arms, “So, did Emet-Selch not approve then?\r\n\tShe was honestly surprised by Emet-Selch’s almost vehement invitation by the end of it all.\r\n\tWith his complete disregard for conventional norms and rules, and his overt compassion, all things which Emet-Selch claims to disapprove of it seemed out of place for him to extend the invitation once more.\r\n\tDespite a few minor transgressions, Emet-Selch has no objections to his joining the Convocation.\r\n\t“You know, while the similarities with Azem are clear, you actually remind me a lot of Emet-Selch a good deal of the time.\r\n\t“Emet-Selch!?\r\n\tIn fact, being so close with Emet-Selch, it’s probably not even a bad thing.\r\n\tThe sound of the study room’s door all but slamming open uncharitably rips Hades out of his concentration, and he instinctively scrambles for his mask- only to stop and sigh as he regards the man coming in.\r\n\tBeautiful eyes, Hades thought.\r\n\tHades refuses to look at them - if he gives these two the barest hint of attention, he’s not finishing this project tonight - but can’t help but drawl out, “You knew what you were getting yourself into, getting Azem of all people as a mentor.” Helios cuts his eyes at him, which Hades only notices from the ripple of annoyance in his aether.\r\n\tHades doesn’t respond, so Helios cants his head up to ask Hythlodaeus’s chin.\r\n\t“The draft you two stole from my files, you mean,” Hades corrects under his breath.\r\n\t“I would say I cannot believe your level of perfectionism,” Hythlodaeus quips, and from the placidity in his voice Hades can tell his eyes are closed again, “but I know you too well.” Hades can feel a pounding headache coming on.\r\n\t“I’m going to show you why, then, you absolutely insufferable idiot.” A twist of the aether, and Hades barely has the time to think oh, I’m the insufferable idiot?\r\n\tHades blinks.\r\n\tOh no no no you’re not ruining this for me-” Hades sputters, but then delicate hands are on his shoulders, simultaneously holding him down and pressing into a knot he didn’t even know was there- and he does not whine.\r\n\tEven through the fabric of his pants, Hades has to bite his lip not to moan.\r\n\tHades risks a glance downward, and immediately regrets it.\r\n\tHelios is looking directly at him, the bastard, even as he laves the fabric with his tongue, drenching it in spit until it’s clinging to the head of Hades’s cock.\r\n\tClearing his throat, Hades tears his eyes back to his material.\r\n\tA moan wrenches itself free from Hades’s gritted teeth, and it’s all the permission his lovers need.\r\n\tHelios pushes forward, Hades’s cock sliding easily down his waiting throat, no sign of a gag reflex to be seen; but Hades doesn’t have time to fully register it, as Hythlodaeus’s delicate hand cups his jaw.\r\n\tThe gentle touch contrasts with the forceful tug to the side before their lips are meeting, his tongue claiming Hades’s like it belongs to him- and it does, doesn’t it?\r\n\tAnother hand - equally delicate in shape, though slightly calloused in the pattern only a sword handle could leave - curls around Hades’s left wrist, pointedly placing it atop golden waves, and Hades doesn’t have to be asked twice.\r\n\tEyes rolling back into his head, completely lost in working for his partner’s pleasure, tongue stretched out to lave Hades’s balls even as his nose is buried in white curls.\r\n\tThe smaller man’s moans reverberate in his throat, adding to the stimulation around Hades’s cock, and then he’s moaning, offering the sounds of his pleasure for Hythlodaeus to swallow.\r\n\tA small crack - Hades blinks, and the pen he held now lies in two pathetic pieces on the desk, stark black ink glistening all over his hand.\r\n\tThere are tears streaming down his cheeks, a deep flush spreading from his face to his neck, his lips are a crimson that matches Hades’s erection, and he’s grinning.\r\n\t“It seems we’ll just have to make do with each other, then.” Helios’s voice, in contrast, is hoarse and fucked out and going straight to Hades’s cock.\r\n\tHe pushes Hades’s chair back, enough to unfold himself from under the desk and step into Hythlodaeus’s space.\r\n\tIt squeezes at Hades’s heart- and also, at the knot of pent-up arousal in the pit of his stomach.\r\n\tHelios dances away, but Hades still manages to capture Hythlodaeus as his prize.\r\n\tHis laughter turns into chuckles, ticklish as he is, trying and failing to squirm away from Hades’s hungry mouth, but pale arms cage him in place.\r\n\tTheir lips press together once, twice before parting, gently offering Hades the lead instead of claiming it himself, and Hades takes it.\r\n\tHythlodaeus’s moans are among the sweetest sounds Hades has ever heard - he drinks them in like a man starving, and finds he wants more.\r\n\tThere’s rustling coming from the direction of the desk, where Helios is rifling through the drawers, but Hades is not about to split his focus and let escape the one he did manage to get under him.\r\n\tHythlodaeus’s legs part without question, welcoming him between them, but Hades has something in mind, his hands pressing on the backs of Hythlodaeus’s thighs and nearly folding him in half - and from the other’s chuckle, it’s more than welcomed.\r\n\tThe other moans, long and low at first, speeding up and rising in pitch as Hades’s attentions redouble, tongue pressing an insistent rhythm against his entrance.\r\n\tDrool drips on the seat, but Hades doesn’t care, repositioning himself so he can place his hands on the other’s cheeks, thumbs spreading him open enough to let his tongue plunge inside.\r\n\tHythlodaeus cries out, goading Hades into speeding up, eager to hear his beloved sing even louder.\r\n\tDistracted as he is, Hades doesn’t register Helios’s return until a slick fingertip press against his entrance, earning a surprised gasp that becomes muffled into Hythlodaeus’s skin.\r\n\tHades wants to answer, his mind already triggering a suitably scathing response, but then Hythlodaeus’s hand is in his hair, keeping him right where he is.\r\n\t“With that silver tongue put to work, yes-” Helios’s breathy laugh tapers into a moan, and Hades realizes he’s stroking himself, even as his fingers - two of them, now - plunge in and out of Hades’s slick hole.\r\n\t“Stop- teasing-” Hades mutters, unable to stop his hips from pushing back against Helios’s fingers, but all he gets for his trouble is them stilling entirely.\r\n\tWith a smile so bright it could rival the sun itself, he’s pulling Hades up and over himself, mouth briefly finding his before his lips are tracing the line of Hades’s jaw.\r\n\tIt takes some rearranging, too many limbs flailing gracelessly in too small a space until Hades’s thighs straddle Hythlodaeus’s waist.\r\n\tHis cock stands proud, resting between Hades’s asscheeks, rubbing against his slick entrance with every sinuous movement of his hips.\r\n\tA soft curse sounds from behind them in Helios’s voice, echoed into a sigh from Hythlodaeus as slick fingers cup his balls, caressing and running all the way up his cock to where the head rests oh so enticingly against Hades.\r\n\tBut it stops there- and Hythlodaeus, to Hades’s chagrin, again seems more than willing to follow Helios’s lead.\r\n\tHelios takes his sweet time, bending down to press his lips to Hades’s taut back, kissing every tiny freckle, following the lines of muscles and tendons that tense under the soft touch- and then his teeth sink.\r\n\tEach spark of pain, each sucking pull makes Hades’s hips twitch on instinct, grinding against Hythlodaeus’s smooth stomach, looking for any slight friction he can find…but that, too, is stopped, as both his lovers’ hands immediately clasp onto his hips, clearly of one mind when it comes to denying him release.\r\n\tA thread of unseen communication passes between the other two, one Hades could probably have tapped into were he not so lost in his arousal, and then they say in unison, “Beg.” Hades has half a mind to beat them at their own game, wait them out.\r\n\tBut Helios had played his cards right from the start: Hades’s own cock aches from the denied orgasm, interrupted arousal overpowering any and all reason he could reach for.\r\n\tBehind him, Helios shifts; the man’s chest is firm and warm against Hades’s bruised back, pressing him down into the other warm chest under him as he leans in to capture Hythlodaeus’s lips over Hades’s shoulder.\r\n\tTheir kiss is hungry, passionate, ripping little moans and sighs out of him whenever Helios bites down on his lower lip, and Hades is left to watch.\r\n\tWere Helios’s spell not still a chokehold around his cock, holding strong even through the distraction of its weaver, Hades would have come right then and there.\r\n\t“Please.” Hades whispers in the tiniest of voices, muffled into Hythlodaeus’s neck, half wishing his lovers won’t hear it- but they do.\r\n\t“Please fuck me.” Hades makes sure to enunciate loud and clear this time, and inject as much contempt and arrogance as he possibly can.\r\n\tHades muffles his cry into the other’s shoulder, but Hythlodaeus’s rings clear in the room as the hands previously holding him in place now move him, pushing him down and down and down inch by throbbing inch until it’s completely sheathed inside.\r\n\tHythlodaeus doesn’t wait to start thrusting, and it ignites something in Hades to see the gentlest of his lovers driven by passion.\r\n\tHelios is murmuring something, but Hades can’t catch the words, only Hythlodaeus’s answering chuckle.\r\n\tOne finger becomes two, then three, pushing Hythlodaeus’s cock harder and harder against Hades’s prostrate with every thrust.\r\n\tFor once in his life, he obeys, and Hades feels himself tear up as the fingers are replaced by a second blunt head pressing against him.\r\n\tIt pushes, and pushes, and it doesn’t matter how many times Hades has done this before: he feels on the absolute verge of breaking in two, the sting of being stretched so far beyond intended naught but fuel to the drawn out cry that wrenches itself free from his throat.\r\n\tHythlodaeus coos at him, Helios grips his waist hard enough to bruise, but all Hades’s mind can process is his insides being crushed in the best of ways- The same relentlessness that endears some and infuriates most, but now Hades is grateful for it as Helios thrusts, hips pistoning inside him with little regard for comfort and focused solely on making Hades sing.\r\n\tHythlodaeus’s hand clasps around the back of Hades’s neck, pulling him down into the semblance of a kiss that is more teeth than tongue.\r\n\tHelios is gasping and moaning so close to his ear- Hades wants to hear more of it.\r\n\tThe boundaries of their aether blur in the throes of passion and Hades has never felt more right in his life.\r\n\tHis and Helios’s thrusts fall into step and Hades is very aware of how badly he’ll ache tomorrow, but he doesn’t care.\r\n\tAnd he doesn’t: his calloused hand closes around Hades’s cock at the same time he finally, finally lets the spell fizzle out.\r\n\tIt’s barely a heartbeat before Hades is coming, fully this time, painting Hythlodaeus’s chest in white and screaming himself hoarse.\r\n\tWhite-hot pleasure blinds them all, quickly pushing both Helios and Hythlodaeus over the edge in sync, each sputter and twitch of their cocks punching yet another choked moan out of Hades’s lips.\r\n\tHades isn’t sure how much time passes before he can see again.\r\n\tHelios lets himself fall to the side with a contented sigh; with him gone, Hades’s stretched out hole can’t hold their come inside anymore, making Hythlodaeus shiver at their mixed spend lazily running down his cock.\r\n\tWhich then in turn makes Hades wince, with Hythlodaeus’s softening cock still inside of him.\r\n\tThe couch is much too small for three grown men, but Hades finds it suits them well enough.\r\n\tAnd here, before the sticky mess grows too bothersome, cocooned in love and warmth and the certainty of home, Hades lets himself sleep.\r\n\tIt drives Emet-Selch up a wall, almost literally too, for he’s close to escaping every single damn time you even take a step towards his general direction.\r\n\tEmet-Selch doesn’t know if he hates it, or loves it.\r\n\tHythlodaeus has the audacity to  giggle, the cheeky smile never leaving his face even when Emet-Selch whips his head to the side to give him his most menacing glare.\r\n\tEmet-Selch sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose.\r\n\tNo, I don’t,\" Emet-Selch hisses, aware that something in him stirs every time you look at him, and oh how he  hates it, just like he hates that half of his mind seems to turn off every time Azem looks at him with fondness in her eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch of the Convocation of the Fourt— With a groan, Emet-Selch stomps away, yanking his arm out of reach when he hears a laughing Hythlodaeus catching up to him."}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades just hopes that this time around, all of you can enjoy life to the fullest, together, at least once."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades laughs at that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades hums in agreement, \"Indeed, and because of that she’ll always drag us around one way or the other.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Come on, Hades, you can’t fool neither me nor yourself.\r\n\tThis time is Hythlodaeus who hums in response, trying to hide the smirk that usually comes before trying to snark the hell out of Hades.\r\n\tThat sounds good, Hades mumbles, because he feels he sure is due some rest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It’s so  him that Hades can’t help but return a small one in his direction."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Smiling still, Hades slowly gives in to his rest, knowing that when the time comes, he’ll wake and the most important people to him will be there beside him to journey on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Finally, Hades drifts off to sleep, dreams of home, and feels at peace."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She turns her head enough to see Hythlodaeus' cheerfully inquisitive face and feels her stomach turn to ice at the disgruntled and suspicion-laden look on Emet-Selch's own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's voice snaps out like a shot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ...your aether shouldn't be in flux, Emet-Selch speaks again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch moves forward, brow furrowed in annoyance (and concern, but he'd never admit it) as he begins to reach out to see if he can stabilize the woman's aether."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Where Hythlodaeus' scent sings of comfort and succor to her frayed nerves, Emet-Selch's speaks of danger lurking beneath shadowed roots and the tension of a taut bow or harp string ready to be released."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She glares at Emet-Selch in particular."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Vala snaps at Emet-Selch and his damnable questions."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As much as he'd rather not pay her talents any compliments or mind, Emet-Selch can't help but admire the two surges of aether and then a sudden drop and near absence of it entirely."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Have you come to a conclusion, oh esteemed Emet-Selch?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sighing exasperatedly at the grinning man in front of him, Emet-Selch's shoulders slump briefly and straighten."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch will take to the air, Hythlodaeus will be on the ground."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ahh, the fun he, Hades, and Azem have had doing exactly that to one another."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh, Emet-Selch?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She rolls off the branch, catching a thick limb to her left, and swings herself off and away from both Emet-Selch's grasping hand (which misses by only a scant couple ilms) and Hythlodaeus' wild lunge when her feet hit the ground."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Or, Hythlodaeus chimes in before Emet-Selch can call for their mentor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch takes smug satisfaction in the notion that not everyone falls sway to Hythlodaeus' rather glib charm right off the bat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch feels the beginnings of a headache throbbing in his temples."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch hasn't quite forgiven her for her portrayal of him as a megalomaniac in this doomed future."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That’s not a no on the solicitation and how you've upgraded her status, my dearest Hades.” “Call me that before our  guest  and I will ensure you regret it longer than the volcano incident I have yet to forgive you for.” \"Enough of this,\" Emet-Selch says curtly as he settles Grani to the rooftop above her head and teleports to the ground below."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch neither confirms nor rejects his own willingness to participate and focuses his attention squarely on their target."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades  ?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch says after a moment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She's already dealing with Emet-Selch's calling to her in a manner that will ensure her destruction as she is… was…  will be  his own in time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is a little taller still, somehow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He catches the hard look Emet-Selch gives him as he continues his silent approach from behind her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He says even quieter now that Emet-Selch is  almost  there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My dearest, most honorable Emet-Selch, would you do the honors of taking us home?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even without the world torn asunder into fourteen different pieces and twelve thousand years of pain, grief, and loss heaped upon his shoulders to blame, Emet-Selch is still an asshole."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A muffled curse on Emet-Selch’s end and grumbling– something about an ottoman being left out of place and it being Hythlodaeus’ fault– and a series of shuffling thumps and thuds as something (many somethings?)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That certainly answers a few questions she's had since she and Hythlodaeus' talk about how he, Azem, and Hades have been 'together forever', so to speak."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But it comes with the reminder that Emet-Selch  is  there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She feels the weight of Emet-Selch's gaze on her and shifts, just a little, in place."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Well now, isn't she just like his most beloved Emet-Selch in that way?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He is going to enjoy this in a way that may only compare to the first time he and Hades had pinned Azem between them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His dearest will be sorry they missed it and demand every bit of detail he and Hades will be able to offer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It's Emet-Selch who answers her, his voice matter of fact but  deeper  than it was."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch makes a noise somewhere between a grumble and a click of his tongue."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even without the world asunder into fourteen different pieces and twelve thousand years of pain, grief, and loss heaped upon his shoulders to blame, Emet-Selch is  still  an asshole."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The rest of her is worried because the heavy weight of Emet-Selch's gaze has turned piercing and she knows the odds of her winning this are slim to none."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is dangerously close with his arms folded as ever, over his chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That was Emet-Selch's question."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yes, oh honorable Emet-Selch?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch watches, unmoving, as Hythlodaeus pulls several familiar tricks to try and break her guard and grant her the release she denies herself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His hand removes itself to reveal slick-glistened fingers to her sight and Emet-Selch's own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus is in prime form today and Emet-Selch is a little sorry Azem is missing this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Short as her hair is, her bangs are irritatingly long and more than enough to shield her face from Emet's sight as she ducks her head lower and tries to curl into herself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her choked moan and the way she tries so desperately to shake her head, to turn away and hide against Hythlodaeus’ arm and shoulder breaks the last thread of Emet-Selch’s hesitation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch has her by the chin moments later and forces her startled gaze up to meet his."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Be it giving  or  receiving it, that was Emet-Selch’s favorite part of these dalliances."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" H-Ha-- Emet?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She really shouldn’t be so careful with those claws, Emet-Selch and Hythlodaeus think."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch scolds."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Worse yet, that aforementioned incident had meant Hades had  left  the tentacle attached the entire next two days  after  they were done."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His eyes go from where Hades is watching-- and oh how those golden  eyes  see it all!-- to the woman's lovely set of broad shoulders and the expanse of her back he has paid quite the homage to."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Maybe he'll have Hades grant him claws, just for a little while, so he might leave additional traces of their encounter behind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Those official Convocation robes are distressingly attractive, of course, and almost no one wears them better than Azem and Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He gets to make her come, see her undone by his hands,  and  gets his own release via Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The more differences crop up between this traveler and the nuisance he loves, the more at ease Emet-Selch finds himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But  not  in front of Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s hand tilts her chin further up, crouching lower so that all she can see is his face in front of her own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch draws upon that same power once more and casts it with every onze of command he has at his disposal as a single word."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Here is where you erred, little hero, Emet tells her, voice unusually soft and low, and watches the way she flinches at the word beneath his hand and watches him with that same desperate look as before."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Denied, of course, by Emet-Selch's hand gripping her chin and Hythlodaeus' own securely fastened against her breast to hold her back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch finds himself rather impressed as she goes limp and breathless in his paramour's arms."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not that he can blame him, there is a part of himself Emet-Selch finds wanting to see how quickly she will obey when commanded and just how far beyond the horizon her boundaries lie."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus’ cock settles between the toned muscle of her ass and thighs as Emet drives him to his own release."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" From prior experiences, he knows full well that Emet-Selch is going to  lose it  when his turn comes into play; the man loves thighs and hers are that unique combination of well-toned and smooth that he's particularly weak against."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch drawls."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch retorts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's attention returns to Vala."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It isn’t terribly long, though Emet-Selch will admit that watching Hythlodaeus both try to break their new companion’s restraint as well as stave off his own is entertaining."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He places Vala, with a nuzzle and kiss pressed against the nape of her neck, the man has always been fond of necks and loves nothing more than to lavish the surface with any number of kisses, bites, and other marks, into Emet's lap the moment the powerful mage is settled where he had sat moments before."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's arm secures around her waist and pulls her back down on top of him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Fond of a little destruction and danger, are you?” Emet-Selch drawls dryly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Now then, Emet-Selch’s voice is a whipcrack in the silence."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch settles back in the chair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He looks to Hades with a wary tilt of his head, expression gone to worry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" While he and Emet-Selch are perfectly content thoroughly ruining her and leaving any manner of marks she is alright with behind, there is something wrong  in her request."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch would have felt it if she grabbed the tendril of magic and squeezed as well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So she’s not inclined to stop, but there’s something about Emet-Selch treating her gently she’s not alright with– at least that’s about what he can glean from it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It’s Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Here is where you erred, little  hero  , Emet tells her, voice unusually soft and low, and watches the way she flinches at the word beneath his hand and watches him with that same desperate look as before."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch draws her forward, the energy binding her wrists responding to his will until her face is right before his own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet's eyes slide to Hythlodaeus and he nods."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet really there going \"Heat speedrun challenge\"."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Deserved on both accounts, as far as Emet-Selch is concerned."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus' eyes hold the same glow they always do when he is peering into the soul of another and he spots it moments before Emet-Selch does."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It's unmistakably Emet-Selch's aetheric signature but  not  all at the same time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He feels the moment Emet-Selch himself sees it; a shudder of revulsion and surprise rippling through the other man's aether in sharp, jagged peaks and pitfalls."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Quick as levin, he feels the wave of Emet-Selch's aether surround him instantly in a shield."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What he is sure Emet-Selch has seen and more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch has never,  ever  been so disgusted in his life and there are a fair few matters Hyperion has summoned him into that just about broke that proverbial straw."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At long, long last, Emet-Selch's fingers move from where they'd paused between her breasts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She is lowered immediately back into Emet-Selch's lap."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Emet-Selch is looking at her with such a look of grim consternation it puts her on edge."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I take back what I said about doing as what your little tale's version of me would have done,” Emet-Selch tells her, tone testy as the visuals still bounce like spiked glass within the back of his mind.\r\n\tReleasing her hands, Emet-Selch's hands drop and slide up the hard muscle of her thighs to cup her ass.\r\n\tEmet-Selch sighs.\r\n\tWe can see it, my dear Emet-Selch and I that is, and a pretty little soul you have at that.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's hands return to her face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch physically pulls her to the left to move her out of his sight long enough to glare at Hythlodaeus. \""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Vala tries, and fails thanks to Emet-Selch's hand still holding her face in place, to look at Hythlodaeus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She looks back to Emet-Selch and swallows hard against the momentary glint of promise in his gaze."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her head leans further into Emet-Selch's palm as he continues to wipe the tears from her eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch stops mid-word."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of Emet-Selch's fascination and reminiscing over new territories explored and conquered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Emet-Selch of the present's words overlaps with that of her first friend she'd made outside of the Golmore Jungles."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She can see it now, the Gunbreaker's eyes narrowed in a glower (like Emet-Selch's at Hythlodaeus) and his arms folded over his chest in expectation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She can still see the Emet-Selch of that time's expression go from nostalgic joy to eye-rolling annoyance in an instant."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Both Hythlodaeus and Emet-Selch cease their back-and-forth at the sound and turn to her in surprise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Vala's head is bowed forward as best she can muster between Emet-Selch's hands."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch watches the way his lover's eyes widen in surprise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The way Emet-Selch's thumbs stroke and wipe away the mess she's making of her face as though it's the most natural thing in the world."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If he  ever  has the opportunity for a chance encounter with this supposed future self, Emet-Selch promises to treat the cynical nuisance to a lengthy lecture a man of his age and experience would be long overdue for."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch scowls down at her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He's genuinely glad for Hades at this moment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not that the esteemed Emet-Selch would  admit  to them being hurt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ever the voice of reason among the three of them, even if Emet-Selch would argue otherwise, Hythlodaeus prefers to work from behind the scenes than in the spotlight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No, Vala replies with relief clear in both tone and soul as she reluctantly pulls herself back enough that her bound wrists bump against the back of Emet-Selch's neck."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch mutters, disgusted and resigned, under his breath."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “After all, by all accounts, the version of Emet-Selch  she  knows recreated me down to-”  ...when did Hythlodaeus move to stand behind Emet-Selch?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Looks from Emet-Selch, who has resettled his back against the seat and watches her once more, to the little promising smile that widens the longer Vala remains silent on Hythlodaeus' face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The left corner of Emet-Selch's mouth curls up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus reaches over Emet-Selch's shoulder and tilts her chin up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She swallows hard, looks to Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ...entirely too much of  that  for what we  should  be doing, Emet-Selch mutters to no one in particular."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It catches their attention and Emet-Selch rolls his eyes and fixes her with a scowl."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Follows as the keen edge of those sharp claws draws a trail up Emet-Selch's neck to trace the strong lines of his jaw."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She and Emet-Selch  both  swallow hard."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If Emet-Selch is the new designated target, she'll happily oblige and do whatever is asked of her to help."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Tell me, Hades, what  did  she look like in your hands?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She shivers beneath the question and the way Hythlodaeus says Emet-Selch's true name."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ah, for that matter, His free hand, still adorned in the twin glove to the one making Vala use every onze of willpower to  hold still  , trails through the thick white locks at Emet-Selch's scalp."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Beneath her thigh, the hard length of Emet-Selch's cock twitches."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The hand in his hair tightens into a fist, claws scratching shallow, stinging furrows into Hades' scalp.. \"While he is by no means as deft a hand as I in the matter, I assure you my dearest Hades is talented enough to break you too.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He hasn't made up his mind if he's going to take her from behind and have her clean Hades' cock as he does so... or if he wants her mouth around  his  cock while Hades takes  him  from behind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She'd not be left wanting, of course, Hades would ensure a nice writhing surprise or two would help."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ...maybe have her clean Hades off while  he  fucks him?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Never one to hurry unless he deigned it important to do so or it suited him, that Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What a pretty picture they make together like this; her arms are held by the glow of Hades' magic above her so she cannot shyly hide from their eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades' hand against the small of her back and atop one well-muscled thigh (he  knew  the man wouldn't be able to resist for long) to guide her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He savors every little bit of strain, every little display of resistance as she fights the bonds and tries to roll her hips in time with Hades' own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He bets she sings when no one is around-- just like Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades' hands slide cup her ass."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Honestly, for a man as impatient as he is, Hades certainly loves to take his time when he's in the mood for it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He bites down against Hades' neck, tasting copper and the heady tang of his aether beneath his tongue as he breaks skin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Maybe he'll show her what he can do with them on Hades and she'll let him play with  her  in kind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Rather well, really, she makes a choked  'hngh'  in kind and, judging by the way Hades' jaw clenches, she must have squeezed him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He hears the stuttered growl beneath Emet-Selch's breath over Vala's moan and the slap of flesh against flesh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His free hand slides down her stomach to where she and Hades are joined."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus, you wretched- Hades curses both of them when her walls clench around him and grips her tighter, thrusting harder as she cries out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades slows his pace at the sound of his title."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As if to back up Hythlodaeus' threat, Hades' fingers glow with violet aether and trails them up her spine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Vala whimpers as he threatens to take his fingers away, as Hades keeps a firm hand on her hip to keep her in place."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades asks, a little ragged as his movements slow once more. \""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades! \""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Holds Hades to her with teeth and claw digging into his skin hard enough to hold without breaking the surface."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Reeling from the explosion, Vala instinctively goes to wind back her arms around Hades' neck as he pounds into her body."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus' fingers slowing now that Hades has come."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Vala tucks her head beneath Hades' chin and presses a kiss against the hollow of his throat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Given how he doesn't tense or shove her away or make any cutting remarks, Vala likes to think maybe Hades is enjoying the closeness between them too."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Close enough that when Hythlodaeus' fingers, coated in her slick and Hades' seed, trace insistent little secrets around her folds and sensitive clit, she presses herself against Hades' body all the more with a mewling whine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Vala whimpers as his fingers pinch and roll her oversensitive clit and tries to hide against Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades pities her, really, for having caught Hythlodaeus' eye."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades' aether gathers in his fingertips once more as he draws them down her back like claws."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He can't with Hades or Hyperion without their help, but her?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The way Vala would cling to them while he and Hades teamed up against the pair and, at Hyperion's inevitable goading and direction, would reverse the script on  them  ."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Have he and Hades (  especially  Hades) at their mercy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Vala moans against Hades' neck, shaking her head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades' hand is at the back of her head, fingers digging into her hair and pulls."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The fantasy building in his head– his cock deep in her throat as Hyperion and Hades fill her with cock and tentacle alike– drives him into a frenzy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her claws dig into Hades' shoulders, pinpoints of fiery pain as she grabs on for purchase."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To spite the man with a feral grin on his face driving into her body, Hades ensures he swallows the sound as she comes undone on Hythlodaeus' cock."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades remarks with an all-knowing smirk."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My dearest Hades, He purrs, one hand coming up to stroke the long ears of their special guest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus is still on his bullshit and it's Bully Hades hours."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus' hand trails over the back of her head with claw-tipped fingers, he really can't resist their allure and the way they look against her body and Hades’ own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He’s managed to show off to Hades just what she does with the tantalizing threat of pain; how her cunt clenches and squeezes so sweetly in response to the scrape of metal against skin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Whether Hades was talking to Hythlodaeus or Vala is unclear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her fingers flex against Hades' thighs, claws tickling the sensitive skin as she waits for further instruction."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her mouth is  hot  and Hades learns immediately she is not entirely the gentle-hearted little rebel he thought her to be."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Dripping, her expression is torn between frustrated need and smug defiance even with Hades' cock in her mouth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The glare she gives Hades is a promise of retribution."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades says a word he'll later swear he picked up from Hyperion and pretends to not know."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Unmoving, uncooperative long enough Hades and Hythlodaeus both feel a familiar thrill down their spine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She growls against Hades' cock again, a long and drawn-out sound fully intended to punish the man she  can  retaliate against versus the one she can’t touch at the moment, as she reluctantly complies with the order."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her arms are bound in the same aether as Hades’ own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There's a strangled noise from Hades as her throat closes around his length."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Intends to when she returns to see if she can and the same thing happens or if Hades is just… bigger than she thinks he looks at first glance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades certainly seems to enjoy it though, judging by the short breaths, choked-off growls, and other assorted noises that sound very much like those she's pleasured with her mouth before."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, be a dear and fuck her throat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There's a short laugh and he strokes her ears as a reward as she tries to do as she's told, tries to relax as Hades' hips snap forward."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He pulls her off his lover's cock in time to watch Hades' spend splatter against her throat, chin, and heaving chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, bring out the leylines."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After he cleans Hades off, of course."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He withdraws his fingers from Vala's cunt, ignoring her whimper of protest, and settles himself beside her between Hades' knees."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades' head jerks back, exposing his throat as he sucks air at the fair-haired man's mouth wrapped around his cock."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He licks a slightly bitter drop from his lips and reaches out to Vala to reposition her back into Hades' lap."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades glares at him from over Vala's shoulder."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But they  stay  on Hades' thighs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And, right now, Emet-Selch  hated  it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In response, Emet-Selch made a half-snort, half-snoring noise and rolled over again, not wanting to deal with this ball of sunshine in the middle of the night."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ah Hades… you never were any good at pretending to sleep… Not with me, anyway."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even in the dark, Emet-Selch could see the mischievous glitter in his eyes… A glitter that turned into twin sparks when he held out his hand to make a weak orb of lavender light, dim enough that it barely revealed the colors of the room around them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch scoffed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He leaned in closer, leaving Emet-Selch shivering as lips brushed against his ear, his hand ghosting over his clothed groin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even that most basic of touches was enough to spark a smoldering fire in the pit of Emet-Selch's abdomen and he caught his lower lip between his teeth to keep from vocalizing his pleasure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The great and terrible Emet-Selch unwilling to argue with me over something?\r\n\tEmet-Selch admitted with a wry smirk.\r\n\tAfter that, Hythlodaeus continued his ministrations in relative silence, punctuated only by the quiet noises Emet-Selch made in response to them; after his little slip-up, he made certain to keep a fist close to his mouth to ensure there wouldn't be any further outbursts.\r\n\tIsn't that right, my dear Hades?\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At that, Emet-Selch moaned long and low, the sound captured by Hythlodaeus quickly claiming his mouth in a kiss."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So with that matter settled and him being drained in all the best ways, Emet-Selch let his eyes drift shut, content in this slice of home away from home."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even if you do win, Will Emet-Selch truly let you walk away?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch ponders you a bit, before joining you there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet laughs and then clicks his tongue, “Perish the thought!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch simply looks at you with distant humor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet flourishes into a deep bow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet smirks triumphantly before turning to leave."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet gives you a withering look."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet gives a pout."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I am entirely sure.” Emet responds, cupping his chin in his hand in mock reflection."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet tenses, and you turn about face, moving to make your escape."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You force yourself to walk, the memory of Emet’s lips fading like a dream from your mind, ever present, but tinged with the far away feel of a fantasy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch crouches before you, head cocked to the side like a bird."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch gives a dramatic bow when she arrives, placing the green gem in her palm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even as you turn in for bed, are you aware he is watching, and with a smirk you say, “Goodnight, Emet-Selch.” The feeling of being watched vanishes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch catches your bewildered stare."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Tens of thousands of years, Emet-Selch considers to himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch had known the desires of mortals before."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch had need to make no suggestions, no low-voiced implications that you would tire of playing hero with your friends, he needed whisper no temptation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For once, Emet-Selch is the one who is seduced."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch finds himself moved by this, he finds it in himself to move his arms, to reach out to palm your chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your gasp is like music to his ears, and Emet-Selch is relieved to find himself not at all surprised that his aether had struck out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch wraps his arm around you, to add a false embrace to the true one of his aether, to settle a weight on your body to match the weight that coated your soul."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch does not deign to show you vision, of course; Light is unnecessary, it hardly has a place in such a joining."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch reaches down, tugging at you with aether and arms, away from his neck and up to where he can see you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch does not delude himself; he is pleasing to the eye, certainly – this form was specially crafted, after all – and he had a practiced charm of ages."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To have successfully made contact, to have touched him in such a way and learned the touch of his aether on you; Emet-Selch cannot but know how precious these things are to you, how desperately you savor the feeling of it as the moments drag on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Tens of thousands of years, and Emet-Selch has never been seduced before."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Why do you like Emet-Selch?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch, hit me up, that'll only make it all go faster :D Emet-Selch is no closer to finding the truth and he will not be any closer after this, he thinks as he feels the arms around him tighten."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Pressed flush against him, every ilm of your flesh bearing into his, feeling you with his whole body at once; Emet-Selch knows he will receive no answers from this, and he lets it go on, in any case."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Repulsive as it is to lie on the ground like this, in this form, to be prone even as this tiny pathetic little creature mewled and hummed atop him, Emet-Selch, Hades, cannot but think he would do anything to hold you more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As gently as he can, Hades holds you close and closer, ever mindful of every part of him that is sharp."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Strange though the connection may be, Hades sees all as you see, feels it all as you feel, with your consciousness and thoughts pressed so close to his mind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades is curious, so he watches you watch him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades tries to feel how you feel him but is overcome."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To you, this is what Emet-Selch is."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This is all that makes up Hades in your mind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It strikes a chord in your soul – Hades feels it as the ring of a bell, old and low, unheard of, resonating throughout the whole of your being."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades would call you silly, for a sundered existence such as your own cannot possibly contain his own being- SMUT AND FEELS ONLY!Me, choking on my own blood: They have…aether sex…and…bond..Me: GoodMe, with my last breath: …they talk about their relationshipMe: STOP THISMe, dragging out my last breath: Emet gets feels and Emotions and Tempering things happen and the other Ascians a-Me: NO MORE CHARACTERS STOP NO JUST EMET\/WOL STOP THAT’S ALL Believe me you guys, I have written a LOT of Emet-Selch\/WoL dialogue, just you wait... Leaving is harder than it should be; Emet-Selch knows why."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch leaves feeling empty and incomplete."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No force of nature, this, no great will passing protection of power unto you; it is Emet-Selch, it is him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Him, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-SelchEmet-SelchEmet-Selchades- “Emet-Selch,” He hears from the door, just as it opens."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch has been outpaced again; once more you’ve taken matters into your own hands and he is left without answers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch stays where he is, making no attempt to conceal his aether."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch half suspects you would not so much as offer one."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch opens his mouth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch doesn’t have it in himself to blame him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch would prefer to be larger than you, would prefer to dwarf your mortal form as his own soul dwarfed yours."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch knows he is not a good man."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At long last, Emet-Selch is home."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch closes his eyes, the fool, as though he could hide his smile from himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades knows who he is, and he had known when you were lost that he would have no other."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch sleeps and dreams of Amaurot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch cannot believe you go there willingly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hello, hero.” Emet-Selch purrs, fully aware you could not mistake him for another, “Care to guess who?” “Emet-Selch!” One day you’ll say ‘Hades’, and this will all – With deliberate and careful touches Emet-Selch drafts his canvas, even for such a minor magic."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is rich and sweet and sour all at once, the taste very lightly acidic to sting your tongue even as you salivate, licking and pursing your lips about him, eager for more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Please,” You plead, “Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch lets you feel his teeth against your folds."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “E-Emet…” “Emet, I swear if you don’t go down there right now, I’m taking care of it myself.” “Emet.” “Emet!” “Emet!” You cry out in your final release."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Emet-Selch is not a liar, so he does not bother to tell himself he wasn’t moved by your cries all the same."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He’s not a liar, but he still doesn’t admit to himself that if you never call him Hades… he thinks that might be okay."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet has nightmares about Amaurot being destroyedI have nightmares that they’re going to break into my house while I’m asleep at 2 in the afternoon and take me to comma prison Emet-Selch sees the Auracite in your hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch falls."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Urianger, some time ago, before you defeated the Lightwarden Titania and met Emet-Selch, gave you an Auracite by which you might slay any potential Ascian threats you came upon."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Undoubtedly the man is cursing himself at this very moment, Emet-Selch considers, and then goes back to staring at you with feigned disinterest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And now that you’ve shown it to me,” Emet-Selch does not tear his eyes, yellow and piercing, from the crystal, “Will you hand it over?” “What,” Emet-Selch does not enjoy dancing to your tune – there is nothing to enjoy about this at all – but fair is fair, you’ve danced to his, “Do you want for it?” Emet-Selch swallows, because that’s exactly what he intends to do."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch expects your annoyance, your frustrated claims of deception, and perhaps he even expects a tiny measure of heartfelt pleading."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Aaaaaah, perhaps,” You drawl, running your hands up his sides, “But if you recall, Emet-Selch…” Emet-Selch doesn’t understand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Ascian Emet-Selch does not fall to your cunning ways or your awesome power or your pretty Auracite."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is no speaker, he is not accustomed to having to fill the silence, but you seem content merely to look upon him, to smile and hug and kiss him, or tamer still expressions of affection like wringing his hand in yours as you wandered seemingly aimlessly about your surroundings."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is not the speaker, but he does fancy himself a pleasant conversationalist."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch longs, yes, but not for this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch cannot imagine you actually want to put his cock in your mouth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch knows you’ll be the death of him, and here he is, standing still, just letting it happen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It's smooth in your hands – and you do notice that, down there, Emet-Selch is entirely hairless."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch rolls his eyes from up there, still laid flat on his back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" …It suddenly occurs to him what he’s said, and Emet-Selch quickly follows up his words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch couldn’t lie to you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch had imagined himself above such pleasures; he discovers, when your lips descend onto him, that he is quite mistaken."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hearing Emet-Selch cry out for you, moan your name even; the feeling is beyond words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No, no; too late Emet-Selch realizes his mistake."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When you give Emet the succ so good he goes fucking colorblind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" God this was titled \"freckles\" in the draft, it literally started out having nothing to do with porn just fluffy Emet dealing with the realities of the character creatorI am just all around the porn\/angst\/fluff map these days, ain’t I?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" you would not believe how much angst for other fics i've got going onAt least tsundere!Emet is seemingly here to stayAlso I wrote this from comma prisonDon’t worry they’re letting me go soon classes start on Monday :’) Why Nabriales’s latest investigation was going to cause a paradox and destroy the universe, why Pashtarot’s plan for changing Bureau policies was never going to get past Lahabrea, why won’t Igeyorhm stop giving you those suggestive looks shut up Igeyorhm you didn’t see anything, why are you reading my notes again Hades, stop that –  “Hades!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch starts, paper crumpled in his gloves."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You always are there to rescue me, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades just wants to make you feel better."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades is not a hero."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch wonders – if he were to try, very, very hard, would he be able to pretend to himself that it was the desert heat, the everlasting light above, and mayhap just a tad bit the force of his glare, that did the deed?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We are all living in the moment, Hades, and anyone who believes otherwise is either mad or lying.” Hades laughs, and *writes nearly 2k words of angsty Hades\/WoL with 0 prior notice in like 3 hours and disappears into the night* Emet-Selch is out of practice with this ‘love’ thing; you’ll have to forgive him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This is sort of a tie-in with the WoL from “Reflection”, who spends a lot of time talking to Emet-Selch about philosophy, morals, motivations, etc."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Since this is a oneshot series I don’t really have a solid characterization for Emet-Selch to detail his love for WoL, so I more or less used that one, combined with my own personal feelings going through the MSQ and hearing out his story."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It had not been there last time; Emet-Selch would have noticed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet, what’s wrong?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch looks you in the eye and squeezes your arm – just hard enough to get a yelp, to see the pain flash in your eyes, piercing him just as surely."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch does not think any of that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What difference does that make?” Emet-Selch asks, seething."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lifting your arm to his face, Emet-Selch makes his intentions all too clear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This is for you.” Emet-Selch murmurs against your collarbone, lips brushing just barely against you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It should never have happened,” Says Emet-Selch to your body, as though he can command the marks upon it to disappear, “You should never have been hurt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch whispers prayers and praise into your skin and lavishes you in his attention."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a curiously intense, focused gaze does Emet-Selch watch you below him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For now, Emet-Selch simply covers it up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades wonders if this is how you feel – Hades has grown tired of lying and making excuses for himself, so he finally, finally, meets your lips with his, allows himself to drown you both in mortal pleasures."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Honestly much better, 10\/10 would prefer to have Emet just compliment me non-stop instead of go down on me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For the first time, Emet-Selch considers it seriously."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a portion of his aether permanently bound and unwilling to part from you, Emet-Selch is granted an awareness of your physical state."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Were it not against the spirit of it all, Emet-Selch would become physically ill at the very idea of it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch scoffs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Staring down at you, Emet-Selch raises a brow to match his lips lifting at the corner, “Oh, come now, hero."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Once more, he is defeated; if there is one who can deny your small and heartfelt request, Emet-Selch is not he."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch can only watch in rapt fascination as blue twists and wraps around itself, pulling strands of his own aether magnetically along with it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As Emet-Selch speaks, the flaws in his narrative become quite plain to him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ‘I understand,’ he said,” Distinguishing what parts come from his imagination and what’s come from his past is impossible, now; Emet-Selch only continues, “And despite wanting the sorcerer to return to the world, he told him he knew how hard it must be, to be seen as an outsider."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Do not take this as an incentive to overwork yourself, but… I love that about you, Hades, do you know that?” Frowning, Emet-Selch pulls a bit away, carefully reaching up to cradle your head as he removes you from the crook of his neck."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" (One day Emet-Selch might be honest with himself, but today is not that day.)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch finds himself hoping you don’t forget, this time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This was 100% supposed to be a cute little Emet-taking-care-of-WoL sicfic but it turned into storytime, which took up the bulk of it, made it way longer, and I'm not really satisfied at all with the story Emet's telling."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At least Emet got to complain about it in his own narration... Emet-Selch tuts, “Who do you think started that trend, my dear?” Emet-Selch’s hair is well past his waist, more suited towards a woman of finest nobility than… really, any sort of person who would be expected to do more moving than walking across a room once in a while."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As amusing as it has been for him to watch you play over his hair like a child, Emet-Selch is pleased to have your attention returned."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch can practically hear your future self sulking in the future, from the present."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To pass by this opportunity would be a mortal sin; Emet-Selch presses on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Merely speak the words and I’ll repeat them back to you!” Emet-Selch says, enjoying himself immensely as his mind races ahead of his words, “Or would it please you more for me to guess them?” Emet-Selch laughs in his soul, aether brightening, vividly, until it is almost gold again like sunlight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Nothing would stop Emet-Selch from saving them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Still waters run deep, as Emet-Selch is well aware."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch had longed for it so; in that darkness, in those hours, no matter how he had despised the Light."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch holds you all the tighter for it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So apparently Hades in both his boss forms has very long hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Uh hey this was not supposed to turn into what it did I would like a refund, please stop having Emet reminisce about EVERYTHING when he’s with WoL I’d like to write regular romance\/fluff\/smut please So we get Hades\/WoL instead, at Anyder together."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades.” He returned, in a voice lighter than before."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades does not say anything, going over his own work independently, sitting with you in amiable silence."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" From his place beside you, Hades had neither moved nor spoken up, and he wasn’t looking at you, either."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was paying enough attention to the lecture that he didn’t notice the quick flick of your hand against paper to once again wipe away the bits of eraser dust."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Why do you write in pencil?” Hades asked you on the way to the Library, keeping pace to walk at your side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’ll call you Emet-Selch,” You said dryly, prompting a snort of laughter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades wanted to become Emet-Selch, a paragon of society and all of civilization – one of the Fourteen great minds that studied and led research and made all decisions of import within Amaurot – and by extension, the world at large."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Such efforts as mine could never be in vain,” Preening, Hades nearly crowed his next words, taking a few lazy steps forward, twirling a bit, almost running straight into you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You hadn’t noticed, either, but Hades saw the light blush, just barely visible from below your mask."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades felt an odd feeling coursing through his soul; he withdraws from any accidental contact proximity might cause between you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades would probably tease you about it – ‘But who could?’ He’d chime, that comforting tone that mocked you all the same – It wouldn’t do to glare at Hades, after all, Mitron would surely take that as a sign of you ignoring him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Tentatively, you raised yours, with the terrible realization that it was just you – and, glancing over, you saw Hades raising his as well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’ll hear none of that, Hades, it was your little deskmate who brought the issue up in the first place."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It wasn’t like you were smarter for having brought it up – although in retrospect, it was obviously the smarter thing to do – but being better than Hades at something was… Nice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’s face was almost entirely red."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And yet their powers work on the scale of universes,” Emet-Selch drawls, restraining his instinctive desire to lash out at the affront to His nature."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’m glad.” Emet-Selch arches a brow at you, and you wink at him, you precious thing, “I do love talking to you.” Emet-Selch swallows because he sees as soon as you point it out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch doesn’t know what you want him to say – should he compliment your appearance?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I envy you,” Emet-Selch hears you admit and he stands straighter at once, attention piqued entirely."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Digging through your satchel – even as storied and wise as he is, Emet-Selch cannot for the life of him understand how you fit so much in there – you hand him a philter of water, rummaging through it as you pass it to him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch would have burst out laughing, but easily does he realize that someone has made a killing off of your ignorance concerning your own abilities."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet, are you listening to me?” Just imagine, if you will – Emet-Selch yelling to the absolutely 100% convinced WoL “This is water!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I do like writing dark stuff once in a while and I know of at least three chapters that aren’t compatible with the WoL\/Emet relationship in all the other oneshots."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Emet-Selch is a practical man, and well aware of the reality he faces."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Just before Emet-Selch was about to take his rest and depart into the darkness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He admires him, if he’s being honest with himself, but Emet-Selch is so rarely that these days."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch can relieve the Final Days for a few thousand more years."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch realizes when Elidibus turns to him that his presence had not gone unacknowledged, but the emissary’s gesture to him is bare and more for effect than aught else."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You have been an abject failure as a partner to Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch hadn’t felt anything like this in a long time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch waits for him to speak."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “…she was the one who struck me down.” It takes a moment for Emet-Selch to understand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not when he can show Emet-Selch the memory directly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch cannot see this, he cannot look at this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But he shows thanks all the same, the prideful man, and for once in a long, long, time, Emet-Selch feels as though his colleague is not entirely lost."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All will be righted, Emet-Selch reminds himself, all things will be righted; when the world is made whole, when Zodiark returns, He will set all things to rights."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch goes to sleep, retires to his dreams of Amaurot burning and everyone he loved dying or wanting to."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I wanted to write this, but with more Ascian bickering, but I also kept reminding myself that this series is supposed to be Emet-Selch centric."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hope incarnate, Emet-Selch hears in your memories."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It is a sad thing, Emet-Selch muses as he approaches you, dark aether like a stain upon the desert."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Once in a while, instead of accepting, Emet-Selch bids you stop, commands you step back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oft were your own clothes the first casualty of your lust; Emet-Selch seemed to prefer to make you work to undress him, if he allowed it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And Emet-Selch knows it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch strolls across the room, walking to the side, circling."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It’s a special kind of pain, sitting here, unfulfilled, wanting and wanting and wanting, so badly, everything right there in front of you in the form of one far-too-heavily clad Emet-Selch, but you can’t do anything."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch hums once more, but it breaks into a bit of a chuckle as he shifts his weight again, a sound that rises and drops in the air, dragging you along with it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It's almost enough to be humiliating – but Emet-Selch knows exactly what he’s doing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Stepping forward towards you, close enough that you could reach out and touch him, had you the use of your hands, Emet-Selch grins down at you with a terrible, wicked joy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It only makes your heart beat all the faster, the idea of danger dismissed as soon as it came up, your only fear the possible lack of fulfillment, the idea Emet-Selch will leave you wanting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch has his hands overlapped on the very edge of the chair’s back, resting his very chin on it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You’ll let Emet-Selch put you in this state because you’re weak to him, so weak, but if he wants you to talk about how desperate you are to have him touch you, he’s another thing coming."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch has made it clear to you how little he thinks of the “pleasures of the flesh”, despite indulging in them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet.” Emet-Selch pretends not to hear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet.” Your cry of his name is more like a sob."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch knows he’s unlikely to get an answer, but he does want one."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch listens to you beg in amusement but equal parts worry and disquiet pool in his gut; the vessel reacting to the turbulence within, his aether that tugged him towards you even as he denied himself intentionally."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is not the speaker."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Those mocking words were meant for me.” He says, and Emet-Selch realizes as soon as he says it that they were."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch shudders even at the thought, at an unbearable loss his conscious mind yet cannot bring itself to deny."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch loves the dark, worships it, even."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I think, or at least I like to think, that I wrote the smut well, but a lot of the time I never really know how to end it... in this particular case, the part at the end where Emet caves and feels bad and hugs WoL was written WAY before most of the... uh... kinky stuff, and I kinda had to drag the conversation\/story into that when I ran out of \"Emet doesn't touch WoL and WoL is Not Dealing With It very well\" to write."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades.” The acknowledgement is short, simple, and utterly bereft of its normal warmth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Or should I say, the most honorable Emet-Selch?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You heard the news about Hades becoming a member of the Convocation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It had all happened so fast; Hythlodaeus refusing the post, Emet-Selch – the former Emet-Selch, searching for a replacement."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Plain humility, because Hades has at least learned from his mistake – if he does not say so now, you will throw it back at him later."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I wouldn’t want it to,” He says, deliberately misinterpreting your response, “Please, call me Hades.” “As the most honorable Emet-Selch wishes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades.” The way you say his name has nervousness pooling in his gut, even with the knowledge that your dissatisfaction cannot be that great."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades would appreciate it if you told him why you are angry, so he can apologize,” It’s childish of you, but saying that certainly won’t quell your annoyance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades is a grown man and a member of the Convocation of Fourteen,” You shot back without missing a beat, “I find it highly unlikely he is unable to devise a solution for this particular problem on his own.” “The esteemed Emet-Selch defers to your superior wisdom; I concede, I am yet the sulkier of us two.” Hades catches himself, luckily; self-pity is not appropriate at all for the moment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “He didn’t, then,” Hades slides closer to you, his shoulder bumping your own, “And I promise, for the rest of my life, everything that happens to me-” He tsks in mock chastisement, “Is that any way to speak to the most honorable Emet-Selch?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “He has not.” He has and Hades knows it, but it’s more entertaining to argue."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Emet in the short story is shockingly clever and analytical, I like him the more I read it over again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If not, Emet’s just assuming the worst of the ‘lesser beings’, like the bastard he is."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch hasn’t stopped staring at the sandwiches since he got in here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And you don’t suspect Emet is an avid connoisseur of cuisine on the First; he’d been to Eulmore, and he appreciated the finer things in life, but he wouldn’t bother with the trappings of a world he considered ephemeral."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What?” Emet-Selch asks, in that tone that sounds innocent and painfully suspicious at the same time, with wide eyes of disbelief, as though he can’t imagine there’s any reason you would doubt him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ah, finished already, are we?” That smug tone is closer than you expect; you stand and turn around, finding Emet-Selch mere footsteps away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Eme,” You begin, interrupting yourself with a gasp as he bites down on the bare skin of your neck, uncharacteristically sudden, “Emet, not that I’m- not that I’m complaining, but, what, what…” Emet-Selch has no desire for you to know – these words are for him alone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh, no, Emet-Selch thinks to himself, smiling, rolling a sensitive nipple between gloves fingers and hearing you respond with a low whine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades always loves you best, has always loved you best."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The last incident being his nomination as Emet-Selch, which you hadn’t even known about until after he’d accepted it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The sound of the door closing behind him Hades knows his fate is sealed, though perhaps it had been ages ago, when he made the first decision in a long chain of decisions that ended with your annoyance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades sits down across from you, faintly grateful for the small size of your desk, scooting in to rest his face comfortably on his hands, elbows propped against the table."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What a sight that would be for one of the greatest Creators ever to have a seat on the Convocation, walking in on you with your hand halfway down Emet-Selch’s throat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch.” The greeting is stiff, even for Lahabrea."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The esteemed Emet-Selch was just cleaning up the mess he made of it; perhaps he can tell you more about its realized form?” “Emet-Selch?” The tone of your voice is not openly mocking, but only by the slimmest of margins."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “As you can see,” Hades says coolly, sliding his hand up to your wrist, keeping it by his mouth in a gesture that is just barely not overtly possessive, “I am cleaning up my mess."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Indeed, it seems I must commend you, Emet-Selch.” The smooth words have him grinning, the ghost of a smile tickling at the legendary orator’s face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What.” Hades hears from behind him, soft enough that Lahabrea has certainly not heard, coward."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades!” You snap his name without hesitation, and internally he’s quite pleased."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Perhaps I was mistaken,” Lahabrea says, tone rising with smug, absolutely fake incredulity, “I was under the impression Emet-Selch was acting on your will?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades begins to follow up, turning so he can face you and be in Lahabrea’s line of vision at once, but you suddenly slide yourself onto the desk, closing enough distance to shove your hand straight into his mouth and muffle his words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Shall I assist?” Lahabrea offers, presumptuous beyond imagining, and Hades nearly chokes on your fingers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus, Lahabrea, WoL, even Emet gets in on it... Emet-Selch decides to spice up his sex life with a female WoL by giving himself a vagina and having WoL peg him, so he can experience how it is for WoL when they have, ya know, regular old dick-in-vagina sex."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is weird about bodies."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Why, how, under what circumstances he brought it to the fore – Emet-Selch does not remember and does not care to."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He cuts you off immediately; whatever nonsense you meant to spout about him going along with these debauched acts for your sake, Emet-Selch would not hear it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And what?” This is curious; Emet-Selch doesn’t tend to hesitate like this, especially when he already seems to have given this some consideration."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch cocks his head cutely for a moment, and then realizes what you mean."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is exactly the sort you’d expect to enjoy lounging around and being touched."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Predictably, Emet-Selch sees the truth, smiling up at you with those tricky, brilliant gold eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" …Emet-Selch spent a rather large amount of time in your presence, actually."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Rarely do you receive any reward – Emet-Selch is long past the pleasures of the flesh, he’s said before, far removed from the feeling of here and now and it showed – but it’s there if you look for it, if you’re careful enough."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch realizes he’s made a terrible mistake."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch says many things, and his words aren’t lies, but they don’t tell the whole story."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch feels it, inside him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You swing your hips forward, pounding into him so hard that you’re almost a bit concerned, but Emet-Selch rises up to meet each and every press, long, low pants eventually giving way to desperate moans."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Words fall from his lips that he barely understands his saying, even with the Echo, slurred enough that if Emet-Selch just pretends, as best he can, then he might be able to imagine they’re not words of endearments, sweet nothings, pleading and begging for you to – Anything, Emet-Selch thinks to himself as he falls asleep."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet and WoL are consenting adults in a healthy, and mostly open relationship."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lahabrea scoffs disdainfully, as though he’s riding off his hard work – as though Emet-Selch hasn’t been forced to clean up several of the man’s failed experiments already."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades grows as he enters, shedding the title of Emet-Selch, the responsibilities, the weariness; assuming his proper size, his true form."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades takes a deep breath; it even smells like home."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades?” Hades holds you, undresses you, whispers praises and proclamations of love into your skin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Looking up at the ceiling, feeling the arms wrapped around him, warm and bent just the way from his memories, Hades speaks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’s soul weeps, it does, even as the face that looks like yours crumples with concern that cuts him to the quick, even as he feels his own aether in your shade reach out, faint and fleeting, to brush at him, soothe him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades smiles at the not-you, through his tears, and feels relieved to see this shade, this pitiful, ephemeral facsimile of his own creation, smile back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Upon becoming Emet-Selch his behavior has been unacceptable."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades knows all too well how intimate the connection between mind and body goes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades enters to find you waiting, patiently, on the bed, completely robed, your mask carefully secured on your face and the hood of your robes drawn up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I asked you a question, Hades.” Hades is a prideful man."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades crawls."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” You sigh, reaching out to thread your fingers in his hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What do you think, Hades?” His name; a cue that you expect an answer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And to yourself – the office of Emet-Selch, as well?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Most esteemed Emet-Selch of the Convocation of Fourteen,” The seething annoyance in your tone, low and searing as the pressure you press on his core, speaks yet greater volumes of your frustration, “What would they say, seeing you reduced to such a state?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They respect you and therefore do not trespass upon your personal matters – but they do not respect him, even as Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’ve failed me, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your beautiful, cruel, indifferent Hades; your Hades who spent more time napping in some faraway corner of the city than speaking to you, who pretended to be busy and buried himself in one task or another, who would sooner tell Hythlodaeus than mention his nomination to you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your Hades, always such a compassionate creature."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades cannot say he likes it, no matter how he feels himself grow more and more aroused by the second."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That’s the Hades you love, hidden deep past clever remarks and bored dismissals, past the veneer of pride and arrogance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, your Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There’s no more cheek this time; gladly does Hades descend upon you, to fulfill your decree."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “…It really hurt, Hades.” “Of course,” Your Hades is not cowed, not entirely."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your newest Creation was nearing completion – as Hades should well know, having licked it off your fingers – and you’d consulted with several members of Anyder about a different request, a complex one submitted by some researchers who required new equipment to monitor the levels of aether in various environments."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I'll stress that Hades's attitude lately was sort of retconned a bit for the effect of this chapter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For the most part, though, they have begun the reconciliation process and Hades is ready and eager to catch up on all the bonding, updates, interactions and quality time he's been absent for."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “There are no alternatives,” Hades – no, Emet-Selch, says instead."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And yet here you stand – Emet-Selch has followed you, out of the Capitol, into the streets."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch does not beg."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades does."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But he is so rarely Hades, anymore, between meetings and theorizing, and the reality that as the one most attuned to the Underworld, it will be his duty to channel the souls… being offered, into the summoning spell."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He is Hades, your sweet, beloved Hades, whose heart bleeds for the suffering around him, for the mournful souls he must watch plucked from their lives and flickering desperately away as they fade into the lifestream beyond."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So your precious Hades did occlude himself, and take that mask of Emet-Selch unto his heart."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And among them, Hades, your Hades, who has always believed in you and held your words in the highest esteem, he wants to know if you think he doesn’t deserve to be saved."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Then you think that you do not deserve to be saved?” Hades asks, in a mournful voice that tugs at your heartstrings."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Please,” Hades begs; it’s not clear to whom he speaks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If Hades left with you… Even if Hythlodaeus were to step up, no one has the skill like Hades does."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No one can do what your Hades can do."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Would Hades – It’s Hades who clings the most, clings the hardest, argues with you in the silence when all other voices dare not rise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades has always been able to see the Underworld, see the toll of life and death on this world; it makes sense that he is also so fiercely empathetic to the will of the star, the being forged to protect and restore the life living on it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades is always crusading for Him, insisting He can solve everything, insisting this is His will."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You would never accuse anyone of being ungrateful, or less than perfectly devoted – but Hades has always felt such things as devotion on another level entirely."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" …Hades is yours."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stands alone against you, demanding the return of things once lost."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Zodiark defers to your judgement, and with Him, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He can’t have Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades is yours."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Once it’s all died down, once the others have left and Hades is there, waiting for you – he always always waits for you, so devoted and so loving (it’s as though he’s afraid you’ll leave even after everything) – you take him by the wrist and you drag him home."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You make your Hades cry and sob and beg for you, and then you take his pretty, pretty eyes, and you drag him before Him, make him look at his god who is yours, too."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Zodiark is yours and Hades is His so Hades is yours, and no one else’s; your will and His are as one."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And all at once it comes naturally, easily, like flowing water; Hades looks at you with those wide and beautiful eyes which saw so much, in awe and in reverence – And with each passing moment does Hades lay his devotion at your feet, prayer and praise and worship all together."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades presses kisses into your skin as easily as prayers, his soul hums with a hymn at contact with your own, he pours and pours and pours of his being unto your own, relentless in desire and a familiar sinful wish to mark his god as his own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Cloying, cooing, warm and seeping into every part of you that is cold, every part of you which feels fear and anxiety and longing; Hades offers of himself, fills you with himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He tears you away from despair, your Hades, as he always has, covers up your doubts and speaks over them with reassurances until you believe him, truly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch later outright admits the plan is to sacrifice the people living on the Source – WHOLE, UNSUNDERED people – to Zodiark in order to get their original sacrifices back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch cannot quite bring himself to be angry about it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’m tired,” You tell him, and Emet-Selch would have taken the opportunity to mock your cause, but you sound like you’re about to sob and it pulls at strings, stings in his chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch knows exhaustion well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had waited for you, even then, waited to sleep until you returned, trusting that you would come back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I don’t want to go out there,” Emet-Selch hears you choke, hears you sob; it is – similar – too similar, so much the same and yet – “I don’t want to."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch must at least try to make you feel – better, different, anything."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch expects you to look at him, to meet his eyes, but you only stare up and straight ahead, as though you are all alone – Pleased with your reaction – pleased to have any reaction at all – Emet-Selch sets himself to task."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even if this pain cannot be meliorated, even if your weight cannot be lifted and your sorrows banished; Emet-Selch will not deny it any longer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You stare while he does it; Emet-Selch’s eyes do not stray, he focuses entirely on his task, his hands making smooth, efficient movements that gently brush and tug your hair with practiced, comfortable ease."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So you reach out, wrap your arms around them and pull your legs tightly into you, feeling a slight tug on your hair as Emet-Selch leans forward to accommodate your movement."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch brings you back to the bed and you let him, because you don’t have the energy to move."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I love you,” He says, and as he says it, Emet-Selch realizes it’s the first thing he’s said aloud to you since he’s brought you here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You shudder against him, clutching back with limbs nearly bereft of strength, and Emet-Selch cannot but wonder if you know, anyways."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch holds you tight, combs his fingers through your hair as he whispers all words he knows that are sweet and soothing, uncaring what language it is that he speaks, that you hear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “So do I,” Emet-Selch sighs, holding you closer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You cannot,” Emet-Selch tells you, instead of denying, because you are you, the one he had so admired and loved and respected; there would be no pretty lies or petty comforts for one such as you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Remember, Emet-Selch loves you and wants you to be happy!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They’re wrong, all of them.It isn’t sleeping Emet-Selch is overly fond of."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When first they plot the Calamity after the disaster in the Thirteenth, Emet-Selch notices."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch pries your heart’s desires from you, carefully, slowly, unravels your small soul in the old-fashioned way; by speaking to you, observing you, living life alongside you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch sleeps, then, for a long time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But if Emet-Selch knew, in his heart of hearts, that He would have disapproved, then the stain on his soul would have surely stopped him in his place, no?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch waits until he sees you, sees you come into your own, sees this fragment of your soul – which grows and grows with every Rejoining, each restoration of rightness, each piece of yourself slotted back into place – born into this world."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is tempted, just for a moment – you aren’t alive now, you won’t be for years and it’s not even you he’s waiting for, it’s a mere fragment, less of a person than even this Ascended who comes to him now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch goes to raise up another, and ensures she receives most, but not all, of her predecessor’s memories."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Him, Emet-Selch, Angel of Truth, collapsed in the face of mere disappointment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And after all the cracks he’s seen form in your soul, all the warping of your own making and of others, and how he’d watched you shape yourself back into something worthwhile over the years – Emet-Selch is attached."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades gives you everything."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades learns many things about love, from loving you, over and over."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades doesn’t know, but he does it, the feeling comes again and again, the tug in his chest and the pain – oh, the pain, the anguish that burns in his breast, as fresh as the day it was born with Zodiark and the deaths of half his people – it comes again, along with a flood greater still of that feeling, impossible and overwhelming and elating."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They were never close, barely even friends, but Emet-Selch is the only thing that’s like Lahabrea remembers and the only one who does remember outside the Emissary."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Later, Igeyorhm takes her place by Lahabrea’s side and Emet-Selch laughs at the irony."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Absence makes the heart grow fonder – Hades knows this to be true, he knows it well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lahabrea is a man he will mock even after death but Emet-Selch would have never wished for it, never, not that grouchy, arrogant, ultimately brilliant colleague of his who really was an avid and passionate scholar at heart, always eager and stoically concealing his delight in the pursuit of knowledge.)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" On and on and on does the man go, so deep his worry that even Emet-Selch finds himself… unsettled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades will chase your soul until the ends of the earth and far beyond."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For this does Hades rise once again as Emet-Selch, and resolve to accept his duties once more, despite your absence."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Unlike what Elidibus says when he comes to Emet-Selch, when he comes to the last of the Unsundered besides himself, silently, wordlessly, reaching out with his aether."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As much as he intends to offer Emet-Selch of his aether and soul, he would have in return."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch turns him away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With great annoyance does Emet-Selch go to meet this so-called Warrior of Light who has been causing all this trouble."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades wants to cry, because this time it isn’t him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 1.5 POV, narrated by Emet to \"you\"."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet is narrating as \"I\" and \"you\" of course is the same as it's always been."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But other things are in the works too anyways, like a continuation (sort of) of the \"Apology\" miniseries with a couple lighthearted chapters of Amaurot-Era Emet\/WoL actually getting along, a couple kink chapters (if I ever get back into writing porn again lol), and probably an inevitable deeply emotional chapter along the lines of the last one."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had been the one to design it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Igeyorhm and the power of the void, Emmerololth and the elemental aspect of Dark, Nabriales’s research into the fabric of reality and pocket universes, Emet-Selch’s concept of souls and willpower, Lahabrea’s theories on – on nearly everything, what form He should take, how His aether would be structured and behave, Elidibus would need to balance the creation to keep it from spiraling – In the best of times, two intimately linked individuals – ones such as you and Hades, or you and Hythlodaeus, or perhaps under great duress, the three of you together – who had shared aether, could pool their souls to produce a Creation influenced by both minds."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You, Hythlodaeus, and Hades together; that would have been extreme, but believable."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades can tell because how could he not tell, how could he possibly not notice, how his own partner’s soul had grown cold and distant."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades feels your soul still, wanting him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch – no, Hades – has chased you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Go kill half our race, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When this was a last resort beyond any other – measures that would not be taken under any other circumstances, ever – when all thirteen of them were as tormented by the desperation of the situation, Hades more than anyone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch finds you again, because of course he does."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades is skeptical when you first bring the idea up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But there’s a thrill he can’t deny in the idea of doing it in his office, in the office of Emet-Selch, where he receives the occasional visitor and is accustomed to working diligently on papers and academic reports and the like."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You wait a moment, like that, because if the person enters there isn’t really a graceful escape, but Hades doesn’t reach down to signal you to stop or say anything."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades did say something."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The door opens, and you wait for the one entering to announce themselves – but they do not, of course, because who would be approaching Emet-Selch’s personal office if they did not at least know the man already?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Someone who did now know Hades at all – and someone completely unfamiliar with the existence of sarcasm – might have even called his mood friendly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades still hasn’t done anything to you to indicate that you should stop, though obviously neither does – can he encourage you to continue, with present company watching his movements."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your Hades does so love to play games."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You could assault his senses, suck and trace and tease every ilm of him that you could reach, wring every onze of delight from his flesh, and still Hades would have to stay still and silent for it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There’s a pause where Hades lets his breath still, a reaction you can see him show in the angling of his body, an appropriate response to a statement so blunt an unexpected."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades would sooner die than be intimate with Lahabrea, in any way, but the speaker did have a way with words and subtle insults, and with your mouth on him his arousal is inevitable and undeniable."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The laugh that tries to erupt from you has you nearly choke over his cock, mouth and throat convulsing, and Hades’s legs squirm the more for it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That news has already been delivered to me, Lahabrea.” Hades makes no secret of the venom in his voice, impatience coloring his movements as well as his words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Another time – any other time – and Emet-Selch would be quite pleased to tell the man what he thought of his earlier disdain, deride his faithlessness, and finish off with a healthy insistence that Lahabrea keep this curiosity out of his affairs – But Emet-Selch is, frankly speaking, not at all there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If Emet-Selch hopes to get him out of this room, he will need to endure this little interrogation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Of her creation…?” Hades draws it out, uncertain, as your lips still over his cockhead."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades can’t avoid talking about it or draw Lahabrea into talking for him with the regular leading questions or cues of casual conversation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That Hades was going to be aroused during all this was a given."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Only the reality of your own subsequent shame and the actual potential fallout stay his hand, but when the fallout means your ruin just as much as his, Hades needs no further incentive."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of course Hades is enjoying this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Intelligent, affectionate, and Creative.” Hades crows, absolutely shameless, “You know how lovely she is to be around, as well, no?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You’re sure he doesn’t actually let it show, but you can feel Hades’s urge to grin when he catches your movement."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A gasp escapes you through your nose, but you hear Hades cover it up with a slide of his hands over some papers on the desk."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Do you expect me to disagree?” Hades’s voice is filled with prideful challenge, “I am well aware of my partner’s talents."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades tenses beneath you and you fight the urge to giggle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There was a reason Lahabrea had been made the speaker, and despite working with the man in an official capacity, Hades never seemed to remember it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Good, then.” Hades isn’t scornful, exactly, because the pride is still there, and you know the shame of his behavior towards you in the past colors each world."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If Hades is going to go along with all of this, then so will you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Because your Hades knows what he has to say, and he hasn’t said it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He’s close, now, in so many ways – too many ways – and the thrill is enough to keep Hades of the very precipice, without you even touching him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All you need to do is pull back; Hades can’t reach too far forward, otherwise someone will see."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades groans and you’re sure he means to pass it off to the speaker as one of indignation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And of course, every movement you make Hades is intimately aware of, hard in your mouth as he is."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Especially now that Hades is getting himself all worked up, trying to get the speaker out of here, as fast as possible."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If naught remains for you to do in my office but insult me,” Hades spits, and the malice in his voice just edges out the arousal, “Then – then consider yourself invited to leave now, and save us both the trouble.” Poor form, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There are few people in the world he wants to be around less, and having an orgasm while a coworker was physically present, watching him – Hades is depraved, certainly, but he is not interested in anyone but you seeing him like that, not outside of the realm of fantasy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lahabrea was mostly angry on your behalf, after all, and Hades has as of late been an affectionate and devoted partner, following through with every gesture of kindness and engaging in every conversation with zeal and genuine happiness, rekindling your relationship greatly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" …Though Hades’s attitude towards him left much to be desired."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No, your attentions are entirely reserve for the esteemed Emet-Selch, squirming and twitching in his chair, hands reaching down to thread into your hair as his legs finally spread wide, free to knock against the sides of the desk as his hips tilt gently into you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I,” Hades is always so good for you, always mindful to warn in advance, “I am, going to…” Though you could pull back, the desperation of his hand clawing over your scalp, the pounding heartbeat and the tremors you feel wracking in his legs – Hades wants it, bad, so, so bad."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Now, love,” Hades is grinning wickedly, just as you knew he had wanted to, the terrible man, “It seems I have a favor to return, no?” “You can return the favor at home, Hades.” “Home, Hades.” Hades lifts the corner of his lips in that half-smile you adore so much."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I know, Hades.” “Home, Hades.” Hinted Hyth\/WoL\/Emet triangulations going on, but Emet and WoL are in a committed relationship."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Just…” You struggle to find words as heat finds your face from the memory; Hades, insufferable creature he is, notices with immediate satisfaction."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That’s how you got here; sitting at Emet-Selch’s desk, in his office in the Capitol building, undergarments completely removed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, for his part, merely leans in, painfully close to your growing arousal that leaks onto the chair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Of course, your appearance is nothing compared to your personality,” He continues, and you feel a wet lick on the inside of your thigh – Hades bears down on it in an open-mouthed kiss, trailing upwards – and you curl your hands for strength, “You are also brilliantly intelligent."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Of course, I did not expect you to be here instead of Hades, but any time is a good time to let my most charming and brilliant friend know how amazing she is.” Your legs twitch, and you’re sure Hades below can feel your sex twitching against his mouth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You feel like squirming and you know Hyth can see it, as well as Hades can feel it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Just answer the question.” Grinding it out, you try to squeeze your legs around Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades instructed me to come here,” Hythlodaeus chirps with that absolutely disgusting good cheer and sweet demeanor, “And let you know what I think of you.” If Hades has specifically invited your mutual friend to participate without telling him exactly what he was getting into, you’re going to wring his neck."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At least Hades had not been so thoughtless as to drag Hyth into this without his knowledge."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades takes this as his cue to suck freely – a small slurping noise you’re not sure Hyth can hear, but you feel in excruciating detail, delicate flesh being drawn into his mouth, along lips slick with saliva, pursing and kneading."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For all his diligent control, Hades’s mouth twitches over your sex in what would have been a laugh – or a chuckle – and your ankles twist, fingers curling in his hair tight enough to hurt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You should have come in instead of him, last time,” At the mention of it, Hades frowns – except his mouth is quite occupied, so hips lips merely squeeze about your folds, tightening over the pulse, tongue lapping at what he’d taken in his mouth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades can certainly do better than this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Beneath you, Hades’s mouth stops working over your sex."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades has a remarkable talent for planning and plotting and manipulating, getting every piece just exactly into position, controlling how events play out perfectly, cornering his opponent quite thoroughly… only for it to all fall down around him in the worst way possible."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even though you nearly jump at the sensation – Hyth is watching, he can see your every movement, hear you whine softly as Hades draws his tongue back too fast – it’s time to assert yourself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You dig your hands harder in Hades’s hair and tug him forward into your sex, forcing him closer, nearly dragging him where you want by the hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hearing Hades suck in a deep breath through his nose – as much as he was able to with you pulling him in."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It gives Hades more leverage, lets him delve deeper; tongue writhing over your folds, pressing his mouth into your sex and turning his head to the side to get deeper, to angle more sharply into this one crevice, and then another."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There’s a chiding in your voice that makes Hades’s hands tighten on your thighs, clenching and kneading into muscle with a delightful strength, a relieving pain that releases tension."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His victory so close at hand and Hades does not falter for a moment, even as he worries over your labia with his lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But he only laughs, well enough, and you can tell that has Hades wavering, tongue stroking in slower motions until you pinch your nails into him in warning."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Who would have thought?” Hyth says, and you’re sure he’s winking under the mask, “Our own Emet-Selch, a depraved lecher in the sheets."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, of course, is hard already."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “He… certainly spends quite a fair while napping, if that is true.” It’s fair to say Hyth probably has a hard time imagining Hades as passionate about anything."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And Hades in particular – well, he just loves to be pushed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Did you hear that, Hades?” You ask lightly, petting his hair gently again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even when you leave off pressure, Hades is pressed into you, lapping and licking and sucking away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades pauses a moment, then purses his lips over your clit and sucks hard."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You do so love to watch, don’t you, Emet-Selch?” Hades tenses beneath you, too, pressing his mouth hard into your sex, leaning his head into your thigh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I am merely teasing.” With Hades tugging at your aether like a child desperate for attention, hands clinging hard over your thighs, you cannot listen closely enough to tell how truly he means it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I would not lay hands upon anyone else,” You near murmur as you feel Hades suck at you more, lathering attention over your clit, kissing sweetly enough to make your legs twitch in the desire to wrap around him, “And of course, neither would he."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His grin is one you suspect Hades might be giving you, were his face visible."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Beneath your fingers, Hades’s face blooms into familiar amusement, cheeks warming to your fingertips in delight, rumbles of amusement trembling through him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You want to lean back, yank Hades in by the hair and pretend he’s not grinning against your cunt by forcing him to make you come, again, and again, and again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’m not going to,” The admission chokes at your throat as soon as it rises, you look away, eyes fixed on the desk, on your fingers that dance and curl with the dance of Hades’s tongue over you, “I’m not going to come while you’re here.” Pulling from your sex in a loss of sensation that leaves you shocked and aching, if only for a moment, Hades growls."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Half-familiar, even, possessed of an echo of terrible power unique to Hades in all the world."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And Hades snickers at it, vibrating further against your folds when you are already so close, the wretch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Or more likely, because he had grown tired of your stubbornness and wanted to see you fall apart, already; you had personally never been too interested in having another present, so it is not surprising Hades would extract you from this situation himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His work begins in earnest, and you are made to understand intimately just how talented Emet-Selch’s tongue really was."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades…” You say, between open-mouthed pants, struggling to maintain your grip in his hair as desire wracks through you, pulls your tendons taut and then loose, the rest of your body fading from awareness as your mounting lust consumes you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The sound of your voice consumes him as well; and Hades consumes you like a man possessed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The hard point of pleasure swells and presses from within, and you have to fight, trembling, not to flinch away from the sensation – not that Hades would have let you go, anyways."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” His name from your lips is the most natural thing in the world, and for a brief moment your climax is interrupted with the rush of purest emotion, all tied to that name, of that one soul, “Hades!” Hades pushes your chair back, and you lay there, limp with pleasure and the warm haze of satisfaction, lax against the chair as he lifts you up, settles you on his lap."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You bask there, in the warmth of your afterglow and of Hades’s affection, poured over you like chilled water over hot, aching muscles."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The sight of the esteemed Emet-Selch – having skipped the Convocation meeting today, quite scandalous – stretched out on your couch, fully in the nude, would be surprising enough in itself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’s mouth is open wide, lips glistening with saliva as he pants, cheeks flushed, eyes glazed over in lustful desire."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Why Hades thought he needed it was anyone’s guess – he’d certainly never had any trouble getting himself ready before."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades, love,” You casually begin as you walk away to set your things down on a nearby table, “I didn’t know you were partial to such things."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Leaning back on the table, casually, not missing how his gaze remains fixed on you, you say, “I think you’ve come enough for both of us, esteemed Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “There,” Hades’s voice sounds like breath in your ears, amplified by his aether running over you, “I’ve come to you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” You say lowly, feeling a thick branch of aether wind around your torso, “I am answering the door.” Hades seems wholly unconcerned with the development, instead reveling in a comically transparent surrender, taking his time to squirm close to your skin beneath your clothes, toy around your collar and your neck."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I had heard Hades was not at the Convocation meeting this morning."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Normally you’d be a bit more composed, but Hades wriggles himself in your hold, stretching and reaching – you must wind out more and more aether from yourself to wrap him up more securely, hold him back several paces from the door."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That Emet-Selch is a depraved hedonist too busy lounging in his own release to attend the duties of his station, you think but don’t say."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Something on your face must give a bit of it away because Hyth’s lips are twitching and between that twitch and the twitch of Hades in your grasp – the clear arousal and wet, dewy desire dripping off him – you’re just about ready to slam the door in his face and teach Hades a lesson."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The decidedly non-titillating nature of your discussion does help, in part, but Hades is doing a marvelous job of working you up anyways, all smooth movement and thick muscle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Crossing his arms, Hyth tilts his head at you, resting his weight on one foot in a way that makes you almost groan – along with how Hades twines one of his tentacles along yours in a lewd gesture that reminds you of fingers twined in yours, and even more the mental image his aether radiates through the twine of flesh; warmth, affection, intimacy, twirling and twisting about you, closer and closer and – “Pollen,” You grouse, settling yourself against the doorframe, feeding off more of your aether to push Hades back, “The sort for individuals hoping to experience a heightened state of – ” “Hades had mentioned his special order the other day."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Traitors are unworthy of answers,” Without moving an ilm you shove back Hades’s tendrils further, stubbornness overriding lust for the moment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’s tentacles are too slick, writhing in your grip."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ah – it is likely that Hades can hear you at this distance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Not that I know of,” You feel heat creep up your face at the words, during which Hades squeezes where he is twirled around you, letting you feel him all along yourself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Nevertheless, he knew perfectly well what he wanted out of this,” Or perhaps Hyth’s smirk is for the right reasons; you’ll need to remember this for later, when he inevitably needs a favor from you or Hades, “So I say you go enjoy him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Slowly but surely, Hades has twined his tentacles around yours, wrapping and slipping and twisting until they are inextricably knotted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” You say in a lowered tone, not caring if Hyth could hear from the other side of the door."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades is well past the time for words, communicating intent to you with a tug on the branches of your aether that jerks you forward, every point of contact burning in your awareness as they twist and turn beneath your grip."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, on his back, loosely palming his cock, looks back up at you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Finally, Hades slides back, laying in the water, staring listlessly upwards."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Don’t I always?” Hades’s tone rings with the sarcastic self-deprecation of a well-chided pessimist."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ah, yes, the esteemed Emet-Selch is busy nursing his cock about now – ” Hades bangs his head against the tub."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In a move you probably should have expected, Hades bucks his hips up, erection peeking back through the waters – a bit less red and pained looking, but still flushed from the tub’s heat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Or instead of dealing with your responsibilities, like a good Emet-Selch.” I've been working a lot on the other Ascians, as I'm sure you've all noticed, but Emet's been getting his fair share of love, too!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet Selch’s cock drags up and down your chest, coddled in between your breasts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet Selch draws in a shuddering breath, quieting for now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Observe the man’s work on Elpis to make a judgement, but Emet-Selch found himself distracted at every turn."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Showing her teeth in a bright smile and asking further questions, though Emet-Selch overheard little of it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There was a function to those furry, animal-like ears then, Emet-Selch surmised."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Wait.” Hythlodaeus reached for Emet-Selch’s shoulder when the latter moved to intervene."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “She’s like to lose a hand,” Emet-Selch bit out through gritted teeth, and the look in his eyes betrayed a level of concern that Hythlodaeus didn’t seem to share."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Then clearly this particular specimen is flawed,” Emet-Selch snarked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Yes?” Emet-Selch needled further as he grew eager for her response."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Turn her deaf to whatever Emet-Selch had planned to say next as she wandered off to admire a patch of flowers that emitted a luminous glow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet another other-wordly term uttered while Emet-Selch and Hythlodaeus exchanged a meaningful glance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “She’s rather incredible,” whispered Hythlodaeus on their way back to the main island, having grown wise to Aeliana’s sharp hearing much as Emet-Selch had."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Rich, pure, and intoxicating to the point that Emet-Selch practically had to bite his own lip to hold back a smile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Something that caused her to beam in delight before she turned her attention to Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I actually wondered if you would tell me more about the Convocation and how you became Emet-Selch.” Emet-Selch rolled his eyes at the two of them already so at ease with each other, but of course they would be."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus just had a natural talent of drawing people in whereas Emet-Selch had always preferred to keep his distance for a time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yes, this was mostly for her benefit really, Emet-Selch insisted while he ignored the warmth that blossomed in his chest upon feeling her touch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus felt how her hand tensed in his when Emet-Selch spoke with platitudes about Mitron, Igeyorhm, and Nabriales."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She’d been a fool to ask these questions in the hope that doing so would be a good way of snapping Emet-Selch out of his haughty demeanor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By the time they caught up to Hermes and Meteion, Emet-Selch had concluded his history lesson and with that, he turned to Aeliana, his brow furrowed in expectation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Never missing an opportunity to let the man he loved shine so gloriously and though he yet found Aeliana’s emotional response to be surprising, he was glad for the approach she’d taken in handling Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Yes, yes.” Emet-Selch waved the compliment aside, having sought none for himself in the first place."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh, Emet-Selch wouldn’t take kindly to that, and Hythlodaeus had barely finished counting to the seconds before his friend made his objections toward the inane plan known."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Since always.” Emet-Selch narrowed an eye and judged her expression to be that of a child caught in an act of mischief."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I wonder, dear Emet-Selch, may I trouble you to move that charybdis away from its fellows?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And what, pray tell, are you up to now?” Emet-Selch crossed his arms in defiance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch threw up his hands and sighed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Out of sight and earshot, and it was then that Hythlodaeus conveyed his plan to the others while providing Aeliana with clear instructions on how to ensure Emet-Selch’s cooperation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Mm, you know, for some reason I do.” Both a puppet and the puppet master’s assistant, she set out to find Emet-Selch a few yalms up ahead."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch?” Instinct carried her feet to where he waited, long before she caught sight of him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The honorable Emet-Selch at his very best, what a thing to behold.” “Hmm, no.” Emet-Selch stepped close enough that she could feel the warmth radiate from his body through the fabric of their robes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Unflinching as he stared her down and Emet-Selch curled his fingers to ball a fist at his side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A profound joy swelled within Aeliana’s heart the very second that Emet-Selch snapped his fingers to summon forth his familiar."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The view higher up was clear enough that Aeliana could witness, just in time, how Emet-Selch took to the skies on his steed to lead the charybdis by example."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I won’t pry—that I will leave to my dear friend.” It wasn’t in his nature to do so, at least never in such a confrontational manner as Emet-Selch often did, and the idea of causing her distress didn’t sit right with him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Now, you were wondering why Emet-Selch joined the Convocation?” Up ahead in the distance, Emet-Selch rode the aether currents to guide the charybdis and Hythlodaeus couldn’t help but smile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Persistent and soothing both while he told her of Emet-Selch’s skill and feats, the adventures he had accompanied Azem on and how those had made the man a vaunted hero in his own right."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A hero…?” She sounded rather surprised to hear about that side of Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That she would avert her eyes to find Emet-Selch riding the wind while she beamed with what could only be described as pride."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not that he could blame her, for he shared in that pride, and it was part of why he loved nothing more than to insist on Emet-Selch’s aid in any endeavor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I am out there putting on quite the show and you two missed the grand finale!” Emet-Selch’s voice rang clear with accusation as he strode up the field."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Uncertain whether the Emet-Selch of today held the same beliefs as the one she knew from days long since past, but she found her answer when she glanced past Hythlodaeus’ shoulder to meet Emet-Selch’s eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Honestly, that is the last favor either of you will be getting out of me.” With his arms folded, Emet-Selch made every effort to sell his displeasure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’m sure it did,” Emet-Selch huffed and kept a keen eye on Aeliana as she straightened out her robe."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “No it was, truly.” Aeliana sidled over to Emet-Selch—exuding more confidence than she actually felt—and held his stare when she peered up at him from beneath her lashes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “An absolute pleasure to watch you work, most honorable Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A smile far too sweet on her lips before she strode past him back down the hill where Hermes and Meteion waited, and all Emet-Selch could do was watch her walk away until he was certain that she was out of earshot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And with that, Hythlodaeus too turned away and ambled down the slope, leaving Emet-Selch with no other option than to follow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Behind them, Emet-Selch cleared his throat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At least, that’s what she hoped for should she survive the next few bells without further arousing Emet-Selch’s suspicions, and then there was her mission."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And pray tell, how far away is very far?” asked Emet-Selch, his tone one of only mild interest and it quickly became clear that he’d opted to change his strategy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A serene and far too wholesome smile on his face while Emet-Selch’s foot slid up to stroke along the back of Aeliana’s calves and set her nerves on fire."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Why yes, I was enabled by the wonderful people over at  Emet-Selch's Wholesomely Debauched Book Club and you're free to join us in Discord whether you write your own or simply read FFXIV fanfic!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Forcing Emet-Selch, Hythlodaeus, and Aeliana to cease the game they’d been playing with one another in favor of giving pursuit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I don’t spot the lykaon anywhere.” Emet-Selch took a moment to scan the area, an air of caution maintained as he looked for any sign of the beast."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I will be just fine—I’m not entirely useless—but should you cross paths with the lykaon, I’d rather it be with someone like Emet-Selch by your side.” Her attention turned to Emet-Selch, the only one left, and immediately her heart started its incessant thrumming once more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I’m yet to discover from whence you came,” began Emet-Selch as he took a few steps toward her, “but here we don’t yell at each other from across the way."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You simply put your lips together as so” —Emet-Selch began to demonstrate— “and blow.” “As you wish, most honorable Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A lover’s affection that even after only having spent a few bells together was so carefree and comfortable, and in such stark contrast to Emet-Selch’s demeanor forever keeping her on her toes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I didn’t, no, but mayhaps Emet-Selch—” Somehow, she hadn’t even sensed his approach until she ended up trapped between them with Hythlodaeus’ gorgeous violets twinkling mischievously, and Emet-Selch’s gravelly words reaching her ears."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Bear witness to the unspoken exchange which passed between the two men before Emet-Selch pressed into her back and let his pelvis graze the top of her tail."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Well?” Emet-Selch demanded, all too casually."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We merely wondered—” A hiss escaped Aeliana when Emet-Selch nudged the top of her tail again and a pleasurable wave ripped through her nerves."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Free to let her tongue sweep across his lips and delve into his wonderful mouth while she rolled her hips back against Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She favored him with a wink, a silent promise that more yet awaited in their near future, but Emet-Selch had to be taught a lesson so she glanced over her shoulder and echoed his earlier demand, “Well?” Seconds passed as Emet-Selch fought to find his voice, his throat bobbing with the amount of times he had to swallow whatever reply sat ripe on his tongue in order to maintain his blasé demeanor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Certain that she’d gotten her point across loud and clear to both of them, and Emet-Selch especially, she walked off."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Kairos?” Emet-Selch raised a sharp brow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh, I…” Unwittingly, Aeliana’s mind drifted to Emet-Selch and a fist clenched around her heart."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Every piece was enormous compared to her own height, despite the spell that Emet-Selch had used to enhance her in size."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Calming her so effortlessly as she left her robe in the drawer and went to open the door, only by an ilm to make sure no one else would catch her looking so uncouth, as Emet-Selch would say."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch, that is.” Though Hythlodaeus couldn’t see it, Aeliana smiled fondly around his pert nipple as her mind’s eye conjured up the associated visuals of a young and studious Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of this grey blob of a bird that sounded overly familiar, and she delighted in the knowledge that concept had come from Azem rather than Emet-Selch himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Fight alongside him, alongside Emet-Selch and the entire Convocation if she had to, to avert the Final Days."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Barely had the door opened and shut, and Emet-Selch made his presence known with a scoffing remark directed at Hythlodaeus, “Of course I would find you here!” “Did you enjoy yourself while I was stuck in another meeting with Hermes?” Emet-Selch raised a brow at his friend."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" On display and facing Emet-Selch, with a knee wedged between her legs to part her thighs and provide his friend with a most intimate glimpse."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lips parted for words or a clever comment that simply wouldn’t come so she sat resigned to burn beneath Emet-Selch’s intense gaze as thickening, silent seconds passed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Not quite.” With arms crossed before him in that typical way of his, Emet-Selch remained at the foot-end and merely watched his friend play a game he knew all too well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Not that I require outside assistance.” Emet-Selch rolled his eyes and relaxed enough that his arms dropped to his sides while he perched upon a corner of the mattress."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The need for further temptation was obvious if Emet-Selch’s restraint was to break so Aeliana pushed her chest forward, breasts undulating as she rode against Hythlodaeus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A twitch pulled at the corner of Emet-Selch’s mouth, the first makings of a smirk that was met by Hythlodaeus’ grin before the latter extended another invitation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Is that so?” Though Emet-Selch raised a brow and fought to remain apathetic, the way he shifted in his position betrayed the arousal that had awakened."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But, unexpectedly—or perhaps unsurprisingly—it was those two words that proved to be the undoing of Emet-Selch’s self-control."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not as Emet-Selch lowered himself between her legs and she felt his tongue drag a delicious trail through her slit that caused her to moan instantly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A rhythm that somehow matched the way Emet-Selch supped on her clit and she melted between them in exquisite bliss."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s nails dug into the meat of her hips as he buried his face between her thighs and his teeth scraped over her bud."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How does it feel to have our most honorable Emet-Selch feasting on you with that gifted mouth of his?” “Wonderful, absolutely wonderful… I—I might…” she gasped and squirmed, feeling a rise of those familiar sensations that threatened to see her come undone for a third time that night but Emet-Selch must have felt it too for he pulled away abruptly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Wouldn’t you rather find out for yourself, my friend?” Hythlodaeus eased Aeliana from his lap, and on his knees that shifted across the sheets, he prowled close to Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Something of a growl rumbled up Emet-Selch’s chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Don’t be ridiculous,” Emet-Selch snarled against the mouth that devoured his own while he pulled Aeliana flush against his pelvis and started grinding across her overly sensitive folds."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Clenching her soaked cunt to quell her desires as Emet-Selch’s fingers fluttered a trail up across her chest to lay a palm around her throat, a gentle amount of pressure applied by his thumb that caressed her jugular."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Show me just how impressive you really are, oh most esteemed Emet-Selch.” With a gentle touch, Hythlodaeus tucked a strand of white hair behind Emet-Selch’s ear and whispered, “I believe a demonstration of your prowess is in order, my handsome friend."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Anticipation winding through her nerves and coiling as Emet-Selch parted her slickened folds to seek out her entrance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch pulled his hand away then, freeing her throat, and in a rather fluid motion captured her calves to lift her ankles up and let them rest on his shoulders."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But he had his answer and so did Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No, Emet-Selch knew what his friend had in mind and wove his magic with elegance and precision."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In concert they worked to fill her and each time that Emet-Selch hilted deep and held himself, Hythlodaeus would pump straight past her tongue to the back of her throat to let her gag around his size."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Those downy hairs that crowned above its base tickled her nose and only from her foggy, peripheral vision did she see him lean over to draw Emet-Selch into a passionate kiss."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One of his hands disappeared behind Emet-Selch, and Aeliana felt more than saw what Hythlodaeus did then."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A playful tease and prodding at a small ring of muscles that coaxed Emet-Selch’s pleasures to a new height and within seconds, he growled his release that burst forth and left her so full."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A semi-wet, fresh out of the shower Emet-Selch, mentions of combat-related blood and injury."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I do think our dear familiar is in need of breakfast,” he pointed out to Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Then you ought to finish playing with her hair and allow her to get dressed,” said Emet-Selch before he caught Aeliana’s eye."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Perhaps,” Emet-Selch sidled closer and knelt to one knee on the carpet, a charmed glint in those golden wells of his."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You are not supposed to encourage her,” Emet-Selch tutted his objection before he too sucked a lingering kiss into her skin, one that nearly burned a mark upon her throat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Do not ask for things you do not truly want,” warned Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her hands at Emet-Selch’s shoulders to push him aside too, even if she’d much rather get down on her knees before him and beg for just the tiniest of drops to tide her over."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For a blessing, Emet-Selch made a show of kind consideration by granting her a fresh pair of panties for a modicum of decency underneath her robe."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What?” asked Emet-Selch when he caught the look in Hythlodaeus’ eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Friends since childhood, he saw right past Emet-Selch’s facade to spot the internal conflict hidden underneath."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hmph, how could I not?” Emet-Selch threw his arms up in nonchalance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Obstinate as ever, Emet-Selch grumbled, “And who says my mind was changed in that regard?” Deadpan and accurate in his response, Hythlodaeus elicited an all too exasperated sigh from Emet-Selch—the sort that had been bells in the making."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A snow-brushed scowl curved Emet-Selch’s brows."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There was the truth then and the crux of Emet-Selch’s frustration."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And I cannot explain why,” admitted Hythlodaeus as his lips teased a sharp jawline in a trail up to Emet-Selch’s earlobe."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’m aware, which is why I stayed last night.” Rather wanting to drop the entire subject, Emet-Selch crushed Hythlodaeus’ lips with his own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His best friend and one third of his heart, Emet-Selch would be lost without Hythlodaeus by his side, especially on those days when Azem was once more out exploring the unexplored beauty of Etheirys."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Something of a snort caught in the back of Emet-Selch’s throat as he trailed behind Hythlodaeus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch cut him off, “Where are they now?” he demanded."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Her name is Aeliana,” snapped Emet-Selch in stark contrast to his attitude only a day earlier when he’d all but insisted on terms such as ‘it’, ‘thing’, and ‘creature’."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Just beyond the bridge that connected the Twelve Wonders to Anagnorisis beamed that unmistakable blue and Emet-Selch summoned forth his most reliable, four-legged familiar."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I don’t understand why she didn’t come and fetch us first,” grumbled Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her aether wasn’t nearly as plentiful as Emet-Selch’s or even his own, and he could only hope that she’d at least enjoyed a level of sustenance before blindly chasing after Hermes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They’d barely crossed the bridge when Emet-Selch suddenly pulled the reins short and his beast came to a halt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Abruptly enough that it startled Hythlodaeus, but when he dismounted and turned his gaze toward the field, he understood why Emet-Selch would move no closer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Damn her,” Emet-Selch bit out through clenched teeth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Whatever she muttered then with something of a sullen grimace, Emet-Selch couldn’t hear but he noticed a shield expanding around her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It’s about time.” With the immediate danger passed, Emet-Selch strode with a brisk pace toward the field where charred rings still smoldered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Curious, as especially Emet-Selch had shown by paying additional attention to the tender, pinked scar across her stomach—a gift from Zenos—but they hadn’t said a word or pushed for answers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “But you should let Emet-Selch take a look at your injuries regardless, and mayhaps you can convince him to mend your robe while I go and have a chat with Hermes.” “Make sure to tell him—” Emet-Selch’s exasperation resurfaced, ready to dish out a lecture for one he believed superiorly skilled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It wouldn’t do any good to have Emet-Selch berate the future Fandaniel so openly, at such a fragile junction in their discussions, and when his emotions clouded common sense."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’m sorry…” Aeliana lowered her eyes as Emet-Selch let a healing caress of his aether drift over the few lacerations on her arm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Next time, at least spare one second to give us a yell,” mumbled Emet-Selch before he realized what he’d said, and groaned upon hearing her laugh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" While her big mouth continues to provoke Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Scarcely masked concern brushed aside for sentiments which were much easier to express—staunch disapproval of her continued impish attitude—as Emet-Selch’s golden eyes narrowed to slits."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I would recommend you end that particular streak immediately or tonight’s delights will have to make way for well-deserved punishment instead.” Emet-Selch released her jaw and let his hands wander to her hips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Anguish rang so clear in Hermes’ voice as he argued with Emet-Selch, “Were I to take up the seat of Fandaniel, it would be tantamount to approving my predecessor’s death."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “No,” wilfully ignorant of Emet-Selch’s earlier warning regarding any disobedience, Aeliana cut him off."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He wishes to be alone, and we—” Emet-Selch glowered when she interrupted him a second time and he had to bite back the urge to reprimand her on the spot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Both Hythlodaeus and Emet-Selch stared at each other then, uncertain of what to say or do to stop her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Try not to worry, and listen to Emet-Selch and Hythlodaeus, okay?” Emet-Selch held his arms crossed and scoffed at her remark."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Of course I do.” This time her smile was genuine as she pushed up to her toes to kiss Hythlodaeus’ cheek, and then approached a less than amused Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You mistake my disappointment for concern!” Emet-Selch blustered as Aeliana walked away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That particular wave which both men knew so well and all color drained from Emet-Selch’s cheeks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Azem’s signature wave… Curious and curioser,” commented Hythlodaeus while he dashed forward to grab Emet-Selch’s arm and stop him from giving chase."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Still reluctant, and endlessly frustrated, Emet-Selch caved and threw his hands up in surrender."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With Meteion between them, they returned to the Twelve Wonders where Emet-Selch allowed for duty to distract him from the ever increasing amount of suspicion and intrigue that plagued his mind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I can’t ask Emet-Selch or Hythlodaeus for help, I can’t tell them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I wouldn’t even have made it out of the Propylaion if Emet-Selch and Hythlodaeus hadn’t shown up.” “If only,” Emet-Selch, leaning against the trunk of a tree, murmured with a single brow raised."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No, she hadn’t, which made for yet another mystery and Emet-Selch but for a moment wished he’d been gifted with enhanced aural faculties rather than his soul sight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The suffering and despair that she carried with her and it was only in that moment that he regretted his words to Emet-Selch—his insistence that they wouldn’t press for answers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We ought to—” Hythlodaeus started but when he turned to face Emet-Selch beside him, he found his friend already gone and making a slow approach toward Aeliana."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For a moment bewildered and Emet-Selch caught the shimmering of her eyes, those clear blues that were glossed over with the tears that her stubborn determination wouldn’t allow her to shed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Then how did you come to discover this area?” asked Emet-Selch and though he was often less inclined toward awe, even he looked around with mild admiration."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Somehow I doubt that is the only reason,” Emet-Selch leveled a playful accusation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Obvious implications hid behind those words and though Emet-Selch merely snorted at his friend’s adventurous spirit, Aeliana spun around on her heel so fast that for a split second, a spot of dizziness blurred her sight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One of Emet-Selch’s brows arched at her sudden, peculiar behavior."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hermes can take care of himself, and perhaps some time alone is precisely what he needs right now.” Two strong arms snaked around her waist then to draw her close, and warm lips in search of those delectable little pleasure spots found the nape of her neck as Emet-Selch spoke quietly, “Whereas what you need is right here, with us.” Holding her caged within his arms, Emet-Selch guided her toward the center of the cave where Hythlodaeus already sat perched upon the edge of the hot spring."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Held her gaze while Emet-Selch ripped the panties he’d woven from her body in such a rough fashion that the fabric bit into her skin before it snapped free."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh, you’re not serious,” Emet-Selch threw back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Legs parting to steady her footing and already the anticipation of whichever punishment Emet-Selch had in mind, tightened a knot of want in her tummy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Very well then,” said Emet-Selch while his warm hand roamed up the back of Aeliana’s thighs and dipped in between, firmly cupping her slickening folds."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Yes,” Aeliana accepted his terms without hesitation in a hoarse whisper that revealed her utter desperation and behind her, Emet-Selch smirked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Those mesmerizing, golden wells of his met Hythlodaeus’ eyes in silent commands exchanged between them, their minds and desires as one before Emet-Selch raised his hand and let the first smack fall on that supple, curvaceous flesh that had been beckoning him this entire time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Its echo regrettably fleeting, until the third strike came and then a fourth, and Emet-Selch settled for an alternating rhythm that blazed from the back of her thighs across both sides of her ass."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It felt divine and freeing to be punished so, especially for those crimes that neither Emet-Selch or Hythlodaeus even knew she’d committed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There came a brief pause to Emet-Selch’s wicked treatment of her body, and she could sense him staring at her backside that blossomed an ever deepening shade of crimson."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Than the very man who administered her punishment today whereas in the past, Emet-Selch would often choose to be at the receiving end of such things instead."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She needed them, and in a stark contrast to Emet-Selch’s ferocity, Hythlodaeus’ touch was gentle and feathery light when he reached out to cup her breasts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Both of his thumbs drawing in circles across her nipples while Emet-Selch, remaining quiet and focused, renewed the palm-aching wallops he bestowed upon her ass."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Suddenly, it made perfect sense why Emet-Selch had warned her not to climax without his explicit permission, and Aeliana cursed the blinding surge of pleasure that washed over her mind when Hythlodaeus parted her folds and began stroking a finger across the throbbing bundle of nerves there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s cruel hand in juxtaposition to Hythlodaeus’ sweet caress."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Spreading her slick as he teased her folds, curled two fingers inside her cunt that clenched around him the very second that Emet-Selch’s palm struck her harshly, and all Aeliana could do was choke out another sob."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Behind her bowed body covered in a sheen of sweat and bright-red welts, Emet-Selch merely smiled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Tears that ran readily down her face just as her slick spilled to coat Hythlodaeus’ fingers, his hand, and Emet-Selch tipped her head to the side so he could lay claim to her lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The moments that followed afterward passed by in a haze, but when Aeliana regained control of her faculties and focus, she found herself cradled in the warm comfort of Emet-Selch’s arms."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh, good…” Peering up through her lashes, she met Emet-Selch who observed her with a gaze that was tender in a way she’d rarely seen of him before."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We should be the ones to ask you, how are you feeling?” Scooting ever nearer to sit snugly beside them, Hythlodaeus draped one arm around Emet-Selch’s shoulder while the other snaked around Aeliana’s middle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hm, good,” Emet-Selch had little else to contribute to the conversation, but nestled his chin on her shoulder and let his lips brush a series of doting kisses across her jaw."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A lingering ache pricked in Emet-Selch’s palms, so vigorous had he been in his punishing administration that scarlet blots still tainted his otherwise pale skin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Cracks of renewed desire resonated in each syllable that she spoke, and Emet-Selch let his eyes drift shut when she sucked his index-finger into her mouth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “But I would also very much like to have my treat now, should you permit it.” The innocent pout that she wore set Emet-Selch’s cock twitching in response, and a low growl rumbled in his throat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So close had she hovered by his lap while Emet-Selch had tanned her backside, and Hythlodaeus had been so tempted then to urge her mouth down over his cock bearing aching and neglected witness to the spectacle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Seconds dragged by and only the fluttering of Emet-Selch’s lashes betrayed just how engrossed he’d become in his own thoughts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gave a small inclination of her head to encourage him in moving closer until he sat thigh-to-thigh beside his dearest friend—precisely where she needed him to be while she slid from Emet-Selch’s lap onto her knees before them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch held her in his eyes until she submerged fully beneath the tropical waters that filled the hot spring."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A few determined strokes used to rouse his shaft further before her mouth ghosted a caress along the tip, and Emet-Selch let out a subdued groan."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I suppose it would only be fair that we allow her to hold the reins for a little while,” he said, a hand thrust into Emet-Selch’s cool and damp hair which he brushed back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hmph, if I must—” protested Emet-Selch but when Hythlodaeus slipped an arm over his shoulder and leaned in for a kiss that set his toes curling, he ceased all manners of resistance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lost as they became, the minutes passed by with only the odd moan to cut through the silence and it wasn’t until Hythlodaeus finally broke from Emet-Selch’s lips to suck in a breath, that either of them realized Aeliana yet remained submerged."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A surge of panic gripped Emet-Selch then and he fisted a hand around her braid to drag her away from his cock and above water, but she showed no sign of discomfort."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’re not the only one with a special trick up their sleeve,” she told Emet-Selch and the amusement rang rich in her tone of voice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Drawing him in across her tongue that treasured every ilm while she satisfied Emet-Selch by hand, intent on seeing them both satiated, and not once rising from her position."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hunger coiled within Emet-Selch and pleasure sparked in his nerve endings, burning a path through his body that started his hips bucking with want into the hand that stroked his shaft."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The two men found each other above the rippling surface where their tongues met and entwined, as Hythlodaeus trailed a touch from Emet-Selch’s shoulder down along his spine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Something of an incoherent moan stuttered from Emet-Selch’s lips when Hythlodaeus began teasing his taut ring of muscles, a gentle coaxing to relaxation before he slipped a finger inside."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thrusting ever so measuredly in a rhythm that, to Emet-Selch’s torturous delight, matched the way in which Aeliana swallowed him far past the roof of her mouth after once more switching her focus between them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The tranquil waters that filled the hot spring started sloshing over the edges the more Emet-Selch squirmed, caught between his two partners who spared no effort in seeing his every need met."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus’ fingers and Aeliana’s lips working in tandem, the two of them having found their connection as one with minds that rode the same current in their desire to see Emet-Selch pushed to renewed heights."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Look at you,” murmured Hythlodaeus as he cupped Emet-Selch’s chin in a free hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The long missed taste of his nectar a divine gift that overtook all of her other senses as Emet-Selch rode out the last ripples of his climax and reached beneath the waters to caress the top of her head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A page taken from his book as she curled her free arm around his lower back and repeated the trick he’d used on Emet-Selch only moments ago."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And so the student becomes the master…” Emet-Selch quipped lazily, still recovering his breath though he wasn’t ignorant to what was happening beside him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A glorious sight to behold and Emet-Selch leaned in, returning the earlier favor by working his tongue into Hythlodaeus’ mouth and swallowing those delightful noises he’d begun to make."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I would be glad to keep your company after your endeavors here on Elpis have concluded,” said Hythlodaeus once she resurfaced and he wrapped her into an embrace that was matched by Emet-Selch on her other side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With your adventurous spirit and a nose for trouble?” Emet-Selch narrowed an eye on her, one that bespoke of challenge more than a critique."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" !” exclaimed Emet-Selch when a beast—scaly, blue, and monstrous in size—came storming around the corner onto the path to meet them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Honed in on their presence, it charged toward Hythlodaeus at an alarming rate that had both Emet-Selch and Aeliana drag him aside at the very last second."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not here and not today—not when Aeliana already struggled so hard to keep her secrets from Hythlodaeus and Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Venat is the former Azem.” Mistaking her crestfallen expression for one of confusion, Emet-Selch explained, “Your… creator’s predecessor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Less so, Emet-Selch,” Venat continued."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Easier said than done thanks to your unruly successor,” Emet-Selch shot back after a split-second of near indignation, a smile tugging on his lips rather than that infamous scowl."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" From her peripheral vision, Aeliana saw the look exchanged between Hythlodaus and Emet-Selch—one that nearly screamed an ‘I told you so’—as her heart dropped to the pit of her stomach."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Worst of all was the look within Emet-Selch’s eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gaze cast to the stone path beneath her sandals so she wouldn’t have to see the sympathy Hythlodaeus held for her, the curiosity that lingered in Venat’s blues, or the growing frustration on Emet-Selch’s face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I have allowed you your secrets at Hythlodaeus’ request,” began Emet-Selch when at last he found his voice again, resonating with clear authority and command while those deep golden wells of his pinned Aeliana in place, “but no longer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Why don’t we move to a place more conducive to calm conversation?” suggested Venat when she noticed Emet-Selch’s fast souring mood and the crestfallen countenance of the one caught at the receiving end of his displeasure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A beat of silence fell when the gravitas of her situation dawned in full on those listening until Emet-Selch shifted in his seat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of Elidibus and Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even without looking up she could see Emet-Selch’s face, the one he’d worn as Solus zos Galvus, manifesting within her mind’s eye and alongside him appeared the vision of Elidibus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That battle she nearly lost though as she began to talk about her journey to The First where she’d met the Ascian Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Speaking of all that Emet-Selch had taught her about Amaurot and the Final Days, his people, and the Convocation’s efforts made to forestall the calamity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How she had battled with Emet-Selch in his true form high above the recreated streets of Amaurot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Utterly preposterous,” Emet-Selch spat his words out when he found an onze of strength to respond at all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Drawn to the slow simmering anguish that emanated from Emet-Selch who’d become lost within thoughts of his own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Listen to yourself,” Emet-Selch snapped when he couldn’t bear to listen to the debate any longer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Turned swift on his heel, Emet-Selch stalked from the humble abode at a brisk pace, leaving nothing but a devastating silence in his wake."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thickening seconds that passed by all too slowly as Hythlodaeus met Aeliana’s eyes—sheer heartache and misery clear within those violets of his that usually sparked with joy—before he too abandoned his seat to chase after Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch narrowed his eyes at her and she took a step back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Barely able to speak of Hades ends there wasn’t a possible way that she could tell him of what exactly happened."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch paused his movements, unsure if the girl was playing him a fool."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades went to touch Venat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He barely said a word in protest and gripped onto Emet-Selch’s arm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Like electricity on a wire fence, when Hades made contact with Venat, they too were pulled in by the power of the echo."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The two men continued to follow the women, the warrior in lead but when Hades looked behind him he noticed the same event of the girls walking was left behind them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Perhaps we will be able to catch up with them.” He held hope while Hades scowled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh my, how cute.” Hythlodaeus spoke and while Hades didn’t speak on the matter his lack of disagreement caused Hythlodaeus to assume he agreed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Both Emet-Selch and Hytholodus watched the scene, uncertain of what to think."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I wonder if Emet-Selch and Hythlodeaus would be able to see souls or not.” While the pair pondered both the two mentioned men stood behind them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The warrior glanced away for a second and Emet-Slech narrowed his eyes at her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Lahabrea lost his sanity; the ability to feel anything but contempt, Elidbus lost his memories; all he knew was his duty and Emet-Selch…” His morality?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades frowned at her words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That’s the concept that Azem used in her recent stunt wasn’t it?” Emet-Selch replied."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ugh, snow.” Emet-Selch made his displeasure known."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If these memories are to be believed.” Hades held onto his disbelief."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades knew that Hythlodaus was right."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But the echo didn’t listen to Emet-Selchs complaints."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Is this who our people become?” Emet-Selch hissed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Together, we could while away the quiet hours, as friend and confidant...if you will accept me.” Zenos’s statement caught Emet-Selch off guard.” Such a change in tone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I accept you.” Hythlodeus turned to Emet-Selch, surprise written on his face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodeus jumped back, a stumble into Emet-Selch who managed to catch him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With one hand connected with Hades arm, Hythloadeus was helped up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Ah, they must be talking about you.” Hytholodeus jested and Emet-Selch let out a grumble."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades questioned, his voice held no scorn, only respect and curiosity to their discussion."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For the voice that spoke was Hades own voice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch watched his future self lean over in curiosity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch kept himself a few paces behind her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I don’t think Emet-Selch saw it after the war."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Something on your mind Emet-Selch?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades who had been silently watching the interaction broke his stare from the two memories."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades.” His name was a whisper, a prayer on the man's lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He pressed his forehead against Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades grasped onto Hythlodaeus's cloak with desperation, a sob left his lips while he was wrapped up in his friends embrace."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Hades wasn't the only one in despair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His lips made contact with Hades's forehead; a gentle kiss but one full of passion."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades hand found its way to Hythlodaeus's cheek where he wiped away the small stream of tears."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus gripped onto Hades's shoulders."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This has been very Emet-Selch focus but I assure you, it is the three of them together."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus stroked Hades's hand which sat snug in Hythlodaeus's grip."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch, perfect timing.” The warrior purred as they faded into the memory."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh please Emet-Selch, just one game."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Find this rather amusing do we?” Hades questioned, his voice rather annoyed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch, I give you my word.” “We should review what we have seen.” Hades looked over to the man, both their emotions had died down but it still lingered in the pair of them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If this goes on long enough we will see to the end of her tale.” Hades frowned at his own words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Romantic erotica?” Hades coughed out at the memories words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodeaus opened his mouth in surprise and gently patted Hades on the back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “The forest is part of who she is?” Emet-Selch paused, deep in thought that was far too much for the simple book."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch, if you were in such a situation what would you do?” What would you do in Caila’s situation?” Both Hades and Hythlodeaus knew the answer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch parted his lips to answer but was quickly interrupted by a knock at the door."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades frowned at her words, it seemed regardless of the time, both Emet-Selchs knew exactly what she meant."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked upon the pair of them, content in the memory."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ah, Emet-Selch not every game can be chess."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades hissed out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades opened his mouth to argue when a voice caught both of their attention."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" While Emet-Selch had slowly started to get used to seeing and hearing his future self, Hythlodeaus was unfamiliar with the sensation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch wrapped his arms around her and rest his head on her shoulder from behind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Meanwhile, Hades stood there, face red as could be while Hythlodaeus has eyes wide with glee."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was, however, still too embarrassed and stunned to reply."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus beamed at him and Hades stared deeply at the floor as if it was the most interesting thing in the world."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus found his way over to Hades and wrapped his arms around him from the front."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He placed a kiss on Hades's cheek."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" While Hades leaned into the Ancient he didn't return the hug but he did certainly lean into it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stuttered in the hug but eventually got his words out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He pulled back from Hades with mischief in his eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades face had just started to lose its redness when it lot back up from Hythlodaeus's repeated confession."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch spoke quietly in her ear, but not a whisper."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It seems that we might be getting a show, Hythlodaeus murmured out and Hades eyes closed in both irritation and embarrassment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch carried her back to her own bed where he lay her down before he joined."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus, Emet-Selch!” Hades's and Hythlodeaus's eyes fell from Venat's to the warriors.\r\n\tHades was unable to prevent the deep blush that covered his face.\r\n\tAre you quite alright Emet-Selch?\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ah well, we just discovered the extent of how well our new friend knows Emet-Selch.\r\n\tThe shorter woman cringed and looked away, just as embarrassed as Hades was.\r\n\tWhile we have this break I would quite like to hear about your romance with Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades hissed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades head snapped to hers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She glanced over at the two men who tried to give her a little privacy, Hades still rather awkward."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Both Hades and Hythlodaeus were taken back by the appearance of her soul."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet the echo memory of Emet-Selch’s tempting offer to the former mayor did not play."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It’s killing him, he never would have had a hope to contain such aetheric corruption.” Hades frowned."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Please if there's anything I can do… She breathed out and Hades was now focused on her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was cut off."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Exarch fell to the ground as all eyes were now on Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She could not bear to look at Hades's expression."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You bastard!” Thancreds voice of hatred echoed yet Emet-Selch still had command of the scene."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Only for Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's eyebrows narrowed at the Hyur but ultimately he sighed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was unable to voice his anger, his frustration."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His voice cracked away as Emet-Selch spoke of Vauthry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Alphinaud's question rang out and it was obvious that Emet-Selch had lost all patience."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's voice was drowned out for a moment as her own voice echoed through the air."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was hard to focus on the memory when Emet-Selchs's betrayal still cut deep."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her expression was pained as  Emet-Selchs's voice was silenced once again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The song drifted to the background and Emet-Selchs's voice was loud once again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch made his way over to the pained warrior before he formed a squat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her past self begs for death, tiny whispers that Emet-Selch never heard were the last thing that they all heard before that final shard fell away from the world and they were engulfed in the light."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades practically shook with anger and he wasn't alone in his passion."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A different expression was held on Hades’s face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades's disbelief."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The events he saw broke him but watching Hades become the most twisted version of himself was another level."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Would Hades be a better reflection of himself?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was utterly speechless, he hated she had been right."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The thought raced through Hades's head and he felt his heart rate pick up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He had encouraged and been excited when he first learned of Hades's future self's relationship with her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades wanted to shout, to scream."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her voice broke Hades heart, he hated how broken she sounded."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades examined his surroundings but was unable to find another soul."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her glasses fell to the ground and Hades caught a small glimpse of her blind eyes before she shut them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It covered her head and Hades's head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Have you seen Emet-Selch or Onyx?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Right, let's find that trouble maker and Emet-Selch then get out of here.\r\n\tWhen Hades opened his eyes he found himself once again in the blinding white nothingness.\r\n\tHades's breath hitched as he took in the soul.\r\n\tHades hesitated but slowly leaned over.\r\n\tThere the woman approached them, Hades behind her.\r\n\tYet the sombre expression on Hades's face told him that he too had witnessed the deaths.\r\n\tVenat asked and Hades looked away.\r\n\tArdbert spoke, he avoided Hades's eye contact.\r\n\t“They must feel it too.” Ardbert mumbled under his breath, something that Hades picked up on.\r\n\tHer body was curled up while Emet-Selch had his arms wrapped around her.\r\n\tif you haven't noticed i did want to clarify that (the first few chapters might not reflect this idk it was ages since i wrote them) but when it says Hades in narration its referring to white haired eplis hades and if the narration says emet-selch then its evil garlean baby Hades.\r\n\tFor once, Hades had not given them specific instructions—instead, he had simply shrugged and said to use what laid within when the mood struck them.\r\n\tAfter months away from Hades and Hythlodaeus, Azem found themselves both homesick…and attention-starved.\r\n\tWithin rested a mold of Hades’s lower torso, from his waist to mid-thigh, and complete with every aspect of his anatomy in startlingly accurate detail.\r\n\t“Let’s see if you still think that’s a good idea when I’m finished, dear Hades…” Hades’s, however, they smirked and carefully drew their claws over its balls, then up the shaft.\r\n\t!” Hythlodaeus complained from his seat across from Hades in their library.\r\n\tHades kept his attention on the book he held in one hand, glasses perched on his nose.\r\n\tHades jolted, nearly dropping his book, upon feeling claws gently caressing his length.\r\n\t“Hm hm hm, did our dear little flame finally open their presents?” Hythlodaeus’s lips pulled into a twisted smile, eyes gleaming as he watched Hades’s back arch, biting down upon his lower lip.\r\n\tAs suddenly as the affections started, they halted, giving Hades a moment to catch his breath and compose himself.\r\n\t“I have not been pouting!” Hades exclaimed defensively.\r\n\tHades shuddered, his mind fuzzing in answer to soft heat running along his length—but not allowing him entry.\r\n\t“Well now, that is certainly an interesting face you’re making,” Hythlodaeus remarked, his wicked smile sending a jolt through Hades’s aching body.\r\n\t“Silence!” Hades hissed through gritted teeth.\r\n\t“…be that as it may—” A groan of desire escaped Hades, hands wandering down to his twitching cock.\r\n\t“Why don’t we get you out of this, hmmm?” Hythlodaeus remarked as he wandered over, delight shining in his eyes when Hades attempted to glare at him.\r\n\tHythlodaeus grasped the cords on the front of Hades’s robe, luring him closer.\r\n\tHades bit back a shiver, feeling phantom claws digging into his buttocks.\r\n\t“You’re not going to…?” Hades scowled when Hythlodaeus’s chuckling evolved into laughter.\r\n\t“No, no, this is quite interesting—I am content to watch.” Hythlodaeus perched on his chair, licking his lips as he looked Hades up and down.\r\n\t“Damn it all,” Hades muttered, sitting on the edge of his seat.\r\n\t“My poor Hades—your cock is drooling all over the floor!” Hythlodaeus teased, flashing teeth with his smile.\r\n\tRather than answer, Hades shuddered, a gasp of anticipation escaping him when he felt familiar heat pressing against his ass.\r\n\tGroaning in frustration, Hades reached between his legs again—but a hand snatched his wrist.\r\n\t“I asked you a question, Hades.\r\n\t“They…t-they…” Hades struggled beneath Hythlodaeus’s gaze.\r\n\tHythlodaeus grasped Hades by the chin, drawing him upwards.\r\n\tHis predatory smile sending a shudder through Hades, whose hands drifted up to grasp Hythlodaeus’s robes.\r\n\tWhich do you think will work more in your favor?” Hythlodaeus drawled, leaning down so his lips hovered over Hades’s.\r\n\t“They…” Hades’s flush darkened.\r\n\t“Good boy,” Hythlodaeus praised quietly, before closing the distance and pressing his lips to Hades’s.\r\n\tA little thrill ran through him as Hades clutched him with desperate need, lips parting invitingly.\r\n\tRather than give him what he wanted, Hythlodaeus broke the kiss and stroked Hades’s chin with his thumb, an appraising smile on his face.\r\n\t“They stopped,” Hades answered breathlessly.\r\n\tHades suddenly pulled from Hythlodaeus, a needy moan escaping him as he writhed on his chair.\r\n\t“Perhaps…we should retire to the bedroom…” Hades managed, his breath coming in short gasps, thoughts threatening to melt under Azem’s taunting affections.\r\n\tDrawing their fingertips down Hades’s length, they laughed softly to themselves at the precum leaking from the tip.\r\n\tHythlodaeus’s replica, on the other hand, had stiffened whilst Azem teased Hades.\r\n\tThey imagined he must have been enjoying the show, and little wonder, given how stoic Hades attempted to be much of the time.\r\n\tAzem laughed to themselves, lifting one of the smallest instruments and running its cool tip up the underside of Hades’s cock.\r\n\t“By the star, what has gotten into them?” Hades panted as he curled around a pillow his body aching from its heightened sensitivity.\r\n\tHades groaned desperately, face half-buried into his pillow.\r\n\t“I will not be satisfied until we have broken them thrice over!” Hades complained half-heartedly, shivering as an unfamiliar sensation stroked up his cock.\r\n\tHythlodaeus barely heard Hades over his own moan of pleasure, feeling warmth pressing against his entrance.\r\n\tJust as Hythlodaeus started to wonder after their attention, the most deliciously desperate moan erupted from Hades’s throat, drawing his attention to his companion.\r\n\tHades writhed, whimpering, his hands going down to his twitching cock.\r\n\t“O-ho?” Hythlodaeus watched Hades intently.\r\n\tHe shifted, positioning himself so he was over Hades, his own length laying against Hades’s.\r\n\tWhen no response was forthcoming, Hythlodaeus reached down and took both Hades’s cock and his own in one hand, stroking them together at a slow pace as he studied his partner.\r\n\tHades’s manhood, he realized, was undergoing a very thorough inspection from Azem…and with a manner of insertable toy he hadn’t expected them to know of.\r\n\tSmirking, Hythlodaeus ran his thumb over the very tip of Hades’s penis, tracing firmly around the hole at the end.\r\n\tBeneath his fingers, he felt shifting and swelling, as if the sound was presently within Hades.\r\n\t“My, my, aren’t they the little deviant…” Hythlodaeus smiled devilishly when Hades’s was eventually granted a reprieve.\r\n\t“A-again…” Hades groaned.\r\n\tHades threw his head back, fists balling in the sheets as he felt slick warmth engulf his glans.\r\n\t“You’re…enjoying this.” Hades glowered at him.\r\n\t“More than you may ever know.” Hythlodaeus smiled, leaning down, shifting Hades’s legs out of his way.\r\n\tHythlodaeus guided Hades into a deep kiss, delighting in the way he surrendered beneath him.\r\n\t“T-too much!” Hades gasped, barely able to withstand the pleasure overwhelming his senses.\r\n\t“Give in,” Hythlodaeus purred against the corner of Hades’s mouth, before drifting to lavish his throat with attention.\r\n\tAttention drifted away from him and to Hades, whose legs suddenly shifted wider.\r\n\tHades’s body arched, a moan rumbling deep within his chest as he felt Azem slide into him, their hand still around his stuffed cock.\r\n\tA second, phantom sensation of being pressed into Hades.\r\n\t“Let me come, please…” Hades begged, voice a mere whisper as he covered his eyes with his forearm.\r\n\t“Aren’t I?” Hythlodaeus drawled, bending Hades’s legs back further, pressing him into the mattress.\r\n\t“Perhaps what?” Hades demanded impatiently, but he grew still when he felt their rips poised against a single entrance.\r\n\tLeaning down, Hyth fastened his lips around one of Hades’s nipples, sucking and nibbling as they both slowly pumped into the shared toy—both eager to fill something.\r\n\tWhimpering with need, Hades drew Hythlodaeus into a deep kiss as their reason began to unravel and give way to lust.\r\n\t“I…by the star….” Hythlodaeus panted against Hades’s mouth.\r\n\t“They’re coming,” Hades moaned breathlessly, lifting his legs to wrap around Hythlodaeus.\r\n\tWith little extra encouragement required, Hades and Hythlodaeus released, their come trapped between them as they continued to explore each other’s mouths.\r\n\t!” Hades exclaimed in disbelief, feeling a hand other than Hythlodaeus’s stroking his cock lovingly.\r\n\t“…debauched…” Hades offered.\r\n\tChuckling, he patted Hades chest.\r\n\tHades peeked out from under his forearm, attention drawn.\r\n\tAzem yawned as they walked through the door of the condo they shared with Hades and Hythlodaeus, a heavy pack slung over their shoulder.\r\n\t“Can we wait that long?” Hades groaned into Azem’s neck, his hardness pressing into their hip.\r\n\tHades drew Azem’s robe upward, but Hythlodaeus reached out to stop him, smirking.\r\n\tHades caught up to them, lips traversing the back of Azem’s shoulder as one of his hands drifting to cup Azem between the legs again.\r\n\t“I grabbed a treat on…mmm…the way through t-the…” Azem struggled to get their words out as Hades’s hand continued to work between their legs.\r\n\tHades’s other hand lifted to Azem’s throat, fingertips gripping their jaw.\r\n\t“Hades, be a dear and take them out of those ruined robes,” Hythlodaeus instructed, violet eyes studying Azem.\r\n\tHades didn’t need to be told twice.\r\n\tThen, Hythlodaeus instructed Hades to help Azem out of the rest of their attire, freeing their half-hard length from their trousers.\r\n\t“They have new scars…” Hades growled as he stepped around to study Azem’s form.\r\n\tI…m-mmm…” Azem writhed as Hythlodaeus kissed them roughly, Hades’s hands gliding over their torso in search of more additions.\r\n\t“Someone seems needy…” Hythlodaeus remarked, hand wrapping loosely around Azem’s throat as he guided their head aside, allowing him to study Hades.\r\n\t“Get a cloth and follow my instructions, Hades.” “Hades, start with their face.\r\n\t“You never do,” Hades muttered, removing the bloodied cloth from Azem’s face.\r\n\t“W-well…” Azem stuttered, their mind wandering briefly to their toys, their cock twitching an answer—bringing a mischievous smirk to Hades’s face.\r\n\t“W-while the gifts the two of you gave me are quite…quite…mmm… H-Hades, p-please—” Azem arched back as Hades slowly worked their cock in his hand, their breath coming in needy gasps.\r\n\t“Enough, Hades.\r\n\tLet them answer the question.” Hythlodaeus raised a foot and pressed gently against Hades’s groin until the other man obeyed and sat back, releasing Azem.\r\n\t“Next question…” Hythlodaeus purred dangerously by their ear, hand languidly stroking their cock, while with the ball of his foot he tended to a flushed Hades.\r\n\t“Well then~” Hythlodaeus drawled, releasing their cock, and turning his gaze to Hades.\r\n\t“Indeed… After how our dear Hades reacted to your rather surprising ministrations, I just knew we would have need to expand our collection…” Hythlodaeus smirked when Azem’s breath caught.\r\n\t“Hades—show them.” A flush crept into Hades’s cheeks as he lifted his damp robes to reveal he was wearing nothing underneath.\r\n\tHades shuddered, fingers curling around his dick as he remembered the sensations.\r\n\tAzem struggled to contain themselves as Hades and Hythlodaeus set about the task of cleaning the blood and dirt from their body, fingers exploring their new scars.\r\n\tDesperate for some manner of release, Azem reached for their own cock again—but at a word from Hythlodaeus, Hades bound Azem’s wrists in ley lines and where they couldn’t reach any of their aching body.\r\n\t“Hades, attend to them while I dry them off.” “Attend—?” Azem arched, a desperate moan escaping their throat as Hades took them into his mouth, tongue rolling over their sensitized flesh.\r\n\tHythlodaeus stepped aside to pull off his soaked robes, a smirk coming to his face as he watched Azem struggle to free their hands from Hades’s ley lines.\r\n\t“W-why?” Azem gasped as Hades took their entire length into his throat, their eyes rolling back as they shuddered—the spell keeping them from their release.\r\n\tHow they wished to pump into something, yet they couldn’t even compose themselves enough to rock their hips against Hades’s ministrations.\r\n\tHythlodaeus gripped his panting partner’s chin, tilting their head back so he could whisper against the corner of their mouth, “Because Hades is not the only one you tormented.\r\n\tHythlodaeus set about the task of lovingly drying Azem’s skin and hair, delighting at the little gasping whimpers of pleasure escaping both them and Hades.\r\n\tA villainous sneer spread across his lips as he reached down, fingers entangling in Hades’s hair.\r\n\tHades, however, glanced upwards with a defiant glare that earned him a flash of teeth from Hythlodaeus.\r\n\tYou won’t be finishing them yet—and not in that manner.” Hythlodaeus gently pulled at Hades’s hair, guiding him off Azem’s shaft.\r\n\tA devious chuckle escaped him when he felt Hades’s resistance.\r\n\tHades’s gaze flicked from Hythlodaeus to Azem, a smirk of his own growing when he saw the state they were in.\r\n\tWho would have thought relieving their tensions would turn into more heated desire?” Hades murmured, fingertips trailing along Azem’s jaw, even that simple touch making them writhe.\r\n\t“Oh, I have an idea…” Hythlodaeus lifted Azem into his arms, then smirked and nodded in the direction of Hades’s dick.\r\n\tIf you'd love to have more stories to read, come join us at Emet-Selch's Book Club, a wonderful community of authors and readers!\r\n\t“Come here, Hades,” Hythlodaeus beckoned as Azem lost themselves in a sea of sensation.\r\n\t“How surprising to see them reduced to such a state…” Hades murmured, his gaze trained on the squirming Azem, his cock twitching in anticipation as he studied their flushed form.\r\n\tHades took a shaky breath and did as he was told, gently enveloping Azem in a network of ley lines, accentuating their body and binding their wrists together behind Hythlodaeus’s head.\r\n\t“You want me to fetch them?” Hades inquired, uncertain.\r\n\tIntrigued, Hades did as he was told and fetched the box of sounds they had purchased upon learning of Azem’s little fixation.\r\n\tThough puzzled, Hades looked at the selection, mulled it over, then did as asked—selecting one with bulbs of varied length and girth dotting its length.\r\n\t“Good—now get up here and use it on them.” Hythlodaeus chuckled at Hades’s visible reaction to the order.\r\n\tHythlodaeus pulled Azem’s legs further apart, hooking them over his thighs, as Hades approached.\r\n\tHades drew closer, nestling himself before both his partners.\r\n\t“Hades,” Hythlodaeus rumbled, jolting the man to his senses, “pleasure them.\r\n\tHades didn’t require any further encouragement.\r\n\tWith that done, Hades grasped Azem in one hand and lifted the sound, drawing its cool tip along their length, listening to the whimpers of anticipation that escaped them.\r\n\t“Why must you both be such unforgivable te…tea…tease…h-hnn…” Azem’s body quaked, straining against their restraints as Hades slowly slid the first notch of the sound inside their penis.\r\n\tWith great interest, Hythlodaeus watched as Azem tried to thrust against it, only for Hades to move with the motion and refuse them their desire.\r\n\tHades carefully controlled them with both hands despite how desperately he wished to reach down to his own drooling cock.\r\n\tHades removed the sound from Azem, leaving them a panting, whining mess in Hythlodaeus’s lap.\r\n\tI am quite curious to see how much of the sound they can take.” Hythlodaeus looked to Hades with a grin.\r\n\tHades’s breath hitched and, a moment later, he promptly began working the sound into his partner once again.\r\n\tHades’s lips and tongue explored their shaft, tip flicking around the sound, pressing against it, teasing Azem into thinking there might be more coming to stretch them.\r\n\tHythlodaeus’s fingers laced into Hades’s hair, guiding him down further to Azem’s more feminine set of genitals.\r\n\tWithout requiring further instruction, Hades began preparing their cunt with his fingers and tongue, a thrill going through him as he felt just how much they were twitching.\r\n\tOnce finished withdrawing the sound, Hades drew closer as he was told.\r\n\tHe flinched, hypersensitive, as Hythlodaeus set about freeing Hades’s cock from the sound being kept inside it.\r\n\tWhen the pleasure threatened to overwhelm Hades, Hythlodaeus gave him the same treatment as Azem, forbidding orgasm and leaving a glowing mark above his cock.\r\n\tTheir struggle to try and milk his shaft didn’t last long, as Hades joining them distracted them from their attempts.\r\n\tWith some adjustments, Hades wove his legs with Hythlodaeus and Azem and sat facing them, his shaft pressed against that of a whimpering Azem.\r\n\tBefore Hades could give much thought to the position, Hythlodaeus took Azem and Hades’s shafts together in one hand and began to stroke.\r\n\tHades, so accustomed to Hythlodaeus’s ministrations, began thrusting into his hand, groaning as he felt Azem’s shaft rubbing along his.\r\n\tHades fared little better, but remained aware enough that he, at least, could still form the words both he and Azem were thinking, “What must we do for you to remove this accursed magick?\r\n\t“That’s…a bit much, isn’t it?” Hades asked carefully despite how his cock ached to feel such sensations again.\r\n\tThen, he turned his dangerous smile to Hades.\r\n\tBreath shaking, Hades obeyed.\r\n\t“I suppose they are more experienced in this field…but I so hoped you would endeavor to impress me, Hades.” Not one to disappoint, Hades let go his inhibitions and began to rock his hips in sync with Azem, a soft groan rumbling in his chest as the sound pressed deeper inside him.\r\n\t“T-too much…” Hades gasped in protest as the head of Azem’s dick pressed against his upon the shared sound.\r\n\tEvery little sound that escaped him and Hades seemed to spur them into trying yet harder to pleasure him despite their compromised position.\r\n\t“Hades—would you like to fuck them?” Hythlodaeus asked, causing a moan to escape Hades at the mere thought.\r\n\tEagerly, Hades pulled himself off the sound, then slowly withdrew it from his partner as well.\r\n\tHythlodaeus beckoned him closer, placing his fingers over the aetheric mark he had placed upon Hades.\r\n\tOnce that was done, he rearranged Azem’s legs with no resistance and smirked at Hades.\r\n\tHades nestled in close before thrusting into Azem’s cunt, their nails digging into his torso as his strong stroke ripped a moan from their lips.\r\n\tHythlodaeus petted Azem’s hair as they took Hades’s desperate pounding.\r\n\t“Tight…” Hades moaned as Azem clenched around him.\r\n\t“Come here…” Hythlodaeus grasped Hades by the jaw and pulled him into an exploratory kiss, tongue dancing over his, savoring the taste of both his lovers.\r\n\tFully overwhelmed, Hades moaned into Hythlodaeus’s mouth as he came, pumping his seed deep within Azem.\r\n\tWhen Hades recovered enough to move, Hythlodaeus lifted Azem so they were straddling his lap, facing him.\r\n\tHades slid a hand up Azem’s torso, massaging the other half of their chest as they rocked their hips against Hythlodaeus with increasing desperation.\r\n\t“Hades, hand me that,” Hythlodaeus ordered, voice thick with lust as he indicated the nearby box with one hand.\r\n\tUncertain which of them he intended to use the instruments on, but eager to find out, Hades did as he was told, then pressed himself into Azem’s back again, his hands moving to slowly lavish their length with attention.\r\n\tReaching between them, he grasped their cock just under the head, while Hades’s hand shifted lower.\r\n\tFrom behind, Hades held them, murmuring praise into their shoulder, his hands and fingers caressing their hot skin.\r\n\t“What do you think…Hades?” Hythlodaeus paused, chewing his lower lip as a wave of pleasure washed over him.\r\n\tHades drew a hand up Azem’s chest to their throat, pulling them back against him, his other hand smoothing over their thigh as he studied them, and where their body met with that of Hythlodaeus’s.\r\n\t“Are you satisfied that you got your revenge?” Hades asked, lips quirking into a lopsided smile.\r\n\tWordlessly, Hades shifted, taking the sound from Hythlodaeus’s hand so he could dig his hands into Azem’s flesh, pulling them down against himself roughly.\r\n\tGently, Hades took Azem’s cock in one hand and began to thrust the sound into them with the other, their impassioned gasps and moans fueling him further.\r\n\t“W-wait,” Hythlodaeus instructed, grasping Hades’s wrist in one hand, a troublesome smile spreading across his face.\r\n\t“Me?” Hades exclaimed as Hythlodaeus guided his hand, removing the sound from their partner.\r\n\tAetheric tendrils erupted around Hades, drawing him back on the bed and drawing him into a most unseemly position, giving full view of his excitement.\r\n\tThe aetheric tendrils began gently working over Hades’s entrance, while Hythlodaeus lifted Azem off himself.\r\n\t“My, my, look at how needy Hades is for you.” Azem’s breath caught in their throat, their gaze transfixed on Hades as he writhed on his back, his legs pulled wide apart by the lavender tendrils.\r\n\tHades gasped as one of the tendrils worked into him, others coiling around his nipples.\r\n\t“Come inside me,” Hades’s invitation rumbled deep in his chest, a taunting smile spreading across his lips.\r\n\tHythlodaeus pressed Azem into Hades, a sadistic grin on his face as they spasmed around his length.\r\n\tHe directed his aetheric tendrils around both Azem and Hades’s bodies as he settled into a sensuous pace, denying Azem any control over their thrusts into Hades.\r\n\tHades drew Azem down into a kiss, inviting in their tongue, moaning against them as the cool aetheric tendrils pulled him apart, making way for Azem’s burning hot cock.\r\n\tHythlodaeus looked on with an approving smirk, fingers stroking Azem’s back as he let them maintain their own pace for a time, their rough thrusts bringing out a side of Hades that was so rarely seen.\r\n\tGrasping their hips, he did as he promised and began fucking Azem into Hades, making them shudder and whimper as they failed to regain control of themselves.\r\n\tNoting the pure struggle upon Hades’s face, Hythlodaeus wrapped his tendrils around Hades’s wrists and bound his arms to the bed and out of their way.\r\n\t“C-close…so…” Hades gasped, arching beneath Azem.\r\n\tA scream of pleasure escaped Azem as both sets of their genitalia found release, their cunt clamping down on Hythlodaeus like a vice, their cock releasing buried deep inside Hades.\r\n\tThey shook and shuddered and clawed, nails leaving angry red lines upon Hades’s skin.\r\n\tHades groaned beneath them, body spasming as he climaxed, spilling his seed between his torso and Azem’s, hands grasping the sheets, struggling against his bonds, and begging permission to touch himself.\r\n\tAzem collapsed atop Hades, trembling and whimpering against his chest as Hythlodaeus’s pace hastened yet again.\r\n\tGasping, Hythlodaeus buried himself fully in Azem and released within them driving them to a second climax, body shaking as they squirted around his length, a dry orgasm simultaneously rocking their dick as it remained within Hades.\r\n\tSlowly, he let his aetheric tendrils withdraw from them, then nudged Azem to roll off Hades’s chest.\r\n\tIf you'd love to have more stories to read, come join us at Emet-Selch's Book Club, a wonderful community of authors and readers!\r\n\tAlas, a long, drawn-out moan escaping Hades’s mouth sent a rush of arousal through Azem.\r\n\t“Then go back to sleep, if you like,” Hythlodaeus suggested deviously from where he sat with his back against the headboard, Hades perched in his lap.\r\n\tAzem raised an eyebrow at them, watching as Hades frantically rode Hythlodaeus’s length.\r\n\t“It is quite entertaining, yes,” Hythlodaeus answered with a smile, his gaze drifting back to Hades as he coiled a hand around his throat, pulling the other man back against his chest.\r\n\tThey jerked away from their shoulder and looked back toward the door upon hearing Hades practically screaming in pleasure—followed by incoherent whimpering.\r\n\tWhat were they to do when Hades made noises like that?\r\n\t“You’re doing this on purpose,” Azem huffed, gaze sliding over to the rather overwhelmed—and still very denied—Hades.\r\n\tThe result is never so pleasant as when we aggravate our poor, mewling, Hades.” They promptly curled up against Hythlodaeus’s side, faint intrigue grasping them as they watched Hades’s eager attempts to pleasure himself on Hythlodaeus’s length.\r\n\t“Please,” Hades begged as Hythlodaeus shifted, releasing Azem in favor of pressing Hades face-first into the mattress.\r\n\tAre you going to apologize for waking them, and without any prompting from me?” Hythlodaeus remarked, resting a hand on Hades’s rump before looking to Azem.\r\n\t“Hmph.” Azem shifted around on the bed so they were in front of Hades.\r\n\tA chill washed over Azem’s body, their skin prickling into goosebumps and their nipples stiffening as Hades took them into his mouth, his hands gripping their buttocks as if he needed leverage to work their length into his throat.\r\n\t“Not quite what I had in mind but entertaining nonetheless.” Hythlodaeus studied Hades, a brow raised, as the man worked Azem’s length with his mouth.\r\n\t“I’m…certainly not complaining,” Azem moaned, leaning back on their hands as Hades continued his work.\r\n\tIt’s not a race, Hades!\r\n\tHythlodaeus shifted, looming over Hades, and began to stroke into him, watching as he continued to service Azem as if he was trying to get them off before either of them finished.\r\n\tTaking a fistful of Hades’s hair, he pulled him off Azem’s length, giving them a much-needed reprieve.\r\n\t“Now, now, Hades.\r\n\tHis violet gaze flicked to them, taking in the marks he and Hades had left on their flesh, a sense of pride coming over him.\r\n\t“Be gentle with them, Hades.\r\n\tDespite the order, the moment Hythlodaeus released him, Hades took Azem into his throat, causing them to gasp dig their fingers into his shoulder.\r\n\t“Then I will simply have to worsen your punishment.” With that foreboding comment, Hythlodaeus pulled Hades off Azem again, then gave the latter an amused smile.\r\n\tAzem took a moment to recover, then did as Hythlodaeus asked, while the man in question began to rail Hades into the mattress, pulling desperate cries of passion from deep within his chest, his cock leaking all over the sheets.\r\n\tAzem walked around the side of the bed closest to Hythlodaeus, arching an eyebrow as he thrust hard into Hades one last time, throwing his head back as he savored his release.\r\n\tHythlodaeus slid himself out of Hades, then turned an inviting smirk toward Azem, one hand still on Hades’s ass, pulling his flesh to the side.\r\n\tChuckling, Hythlodaeus placed the box aside and grasped Azem by the hip, pulling them alongside him behind Hades’s eager ass.\r\n\tYou are to be rewarded, and I know you have fantasized about being the one to dominate our dear Hades…” “Well…perhaps from time to time…” Azem admitted as Hythlodaeus pulled them closer, guiding them toward Hades’s ass.\r\n\tA soft moan escaped Azem as they pressed into Hades, his slick entrance sucking them in.\r\n\tHythlodaeus took the opportunity to seek out their tongue, holding them as they began working themselves into Hades.\r\n\t“Oh?” Hythlodaeus murmured into their shoulder, massaging their chest, fingertips flitting over their nipples while they settled into a sensuous rhythm against Hades.\r\n\tHe shifted, taking in their enraptured expression as they sheathed themselves fully inside Hades, pulling whimpered pleas from the man.\r\n\t“Harder,” Hades whined, bringing a glint to Azem’s eyes that was wholly new.\r\n\tTheir hands gripped Hades by the hips, nails biting into his flesh.\r\n\tA low chuckle escaped Hythlodaeus as Azem gave Hades precisely what he asked for.\r\n\tAzem pounded into Hades with abandon they scarcely ever allowed themselves, reaching as deep into him as they could, grinding their hips against his round ass, and basking in his oh-so-encouraging sounds of pleasure.\r\n\tWhen Azem finally tumbled over that edge, Hythlodaeus released the spell he had cast on Hades, smiling at the primal, guttural moan that Hades released into the blankets, spilling his seed all over his hand, torso, and the bed.\r\n\t“We will send him to work with this, yes,” Hythlodaeus purred deviously, pressing the toy alongside Azem’s shaft and against Hades’s entrance.\r\n\tAzem bit their lower lip, watching Hades writhe beneath them at the thought.\r\n\tIndeed… With Azem often being the subject of his and Hades’s combined attentions, and rarely ever with the opportunity to top either one… Yes, they were the perfect choice.\r\n\tAnd, since it was their idea, they couldn’t rightly complain about it later when Hades inevitably gave in to lust at the office.\r\n\t!” Hades exclaimed indignantly as Azem withdrew, and Hythlodaeus pressed the new toy into Hades.\r\n\t“For a member of the Convocation, t-this is most un…unseem…” Hades groaned as Hythlodaeus pushed the to the rest of the way in, firmly angling it in a direction he knew would break Hades’s train of thought.\r\n\t“Now then, with that taken care of—Hades, you should clean up before you get dressed!\r\n\tYou are going to be late for work~” Hythlodaeus smiled in answer to Hades’s indignant glare.\r\n\t“You…really expect me to…” Hades flushed crimson.\r\n\t“N-no, I’ll do it,” Hades interjected with far too much eagerness, giving himself away to both his partners.\r\n\tHades flushed darker before retreating to the bathroom to ready himself for work.\r\n\tIf you'd love to have more stories to read, come join us at Emet-Selch's Book Club, a wonderful community of authors and readers!\r\n\t“Nngh… Hades may have snuck away from his duties…” Azem shuddered, gnawing their lower lip as they tried to regain their composure.\r\n\t“I confess, I find it thrilling to see you both so needy and willing to let go your inhibitions… You and Hades have always been so prone to holding back…” “Shall I lavish you with attention of another variety while our dear Hades rides you?” The sensation of Hades fucking himself on his toy transmitting to Azem’s aching length.\r\n\tIt wasn’t long until a dry orgasm rocked their body from whatever Hades had taken to doing on the other end.\r\n\tIf you'd love to have more stories to read, come join us at Emet-Selch's Book Club, a wonderful community of authors and readers!\r\n\tUnder most circumstances, Emet-Selch was known to be one of the most dutiful and attentive members of the Convocation of Fourteen.\r\n\t“Emet-Selch, are you quite alright?” Emmerololth inquired with a small frown.\r\n\t“I will be quite fine!” Emet-Selch insisted, putting the thought of his filled derriere out of his mind.\r\n\tIt took all of Emet-Selch’s willpower not to rush the door.\r\n\tDesperate for a reprieve, Hades started riding the toy modeled after Azem, his breath coming in short pants.\r\n\tWould Hythlodaeus merely watch, or would he let Hades serve him too?\r\n\tHades shuddered as he sunk the toy deep into himself and began to grind on it, one hand going to his own cock as his breathing hastened.\r\n\tDesperate, ecstatic moans escaped Hades as the feeling of fullness pushed him over the edge, his own excitement painting the floor.\r\n\tWith Hades, on the other hand…” “Bring Hades’s here and set it somewhere.\r\n\tMore than a little interested in the idea, Azem trotted off to their bedroom and rummaged around until they found Hades’s toy.\r\n\t“So, that explains me—but not Hades.” Hythlodaeus offered no resistance as Azem guided his hand down to the front of their pants—stiff again, and he hadn’t even activated the link between them and the toy inside Hades.\r\n\t“Fiiine,” Azem whined, turning their frustrations to Hades’s toy—just as Hythlodaeus planned.\r\n\tEmet-Selch did his damnedest to pay attention as Lahabrea droned on about…something.\r\n\t“D-damn them…oooh…” Hades instinctively spread his legs wider when he felt Azem press against his anus.\r\n\tThe link was reestablished, and Hades let out a desperate moan, the sensation of Azem’s cock filling him twice sending him immediately over the edge.\r\n\tAzem held back a shudder as they watched Hythlodaeus tease Hades’s shaft with lips and tongue.\r\n\tWhenever Hades performed such acts, he always appeared so…subservient.\r\n\tHythlodaeus ran his tongue up Hades shaft, maintaining eye contact with Azem, then gave the head a gentle suck before asking.\r\n\t“If you need release so badly, why not fill Hades further?” Hythlodaeus asked deviously as he himself straddled the toy, bringing the tip to his own entrance.\r\n\t“I-I’m trying it’s just…” Azem panted, their hips jerking in answer to Hades’s spasms on the other end.\r\n\tA snarl rumbled in his chest as he pulled them in, his hips continuing to work the replica of Hades’s madly twitching cock.\r\n\tTheir desperate cries of pleasure filling the air as they filled Hades with yet another load of their hot release.\r\n\tI’ll make certain Hades is well, well taken care of…” Truly, it was a crime that the Convocation had given Azem time off but not Hades… Perhaps he could rectify that offense.\r\n\tHe groaned as he controlled himself, a dry orgasm rocking his body as he ground against the toy, savoring the thought of how helpless his dear Hades was in his office.\r\n\tWith a shuddering sigh, Hythlodaeus pressed himself into the toy, languidly rocking his hips into it, gnawing his lower lip as he felt Hades clench around him.\r\n\tHe waited a short while, then buried himself in the toy again, this time angling himself in a way he knew would send Hades immediately over the edge—and his plotting was instantly rewarded.\r\n\tThis time, Hythlodaeus allowed himself release, gladly adding to the load Hades already carried.\r\n\tIt would be a simple matter to recover faster and see to filling Hades further, perhaps pushing him to the point where his fullness began to show…but… If you'd love to have more stories to read, come join us at Emet-Selch's Book Club, a wonderful community of authors and readers!\r\n\tWhen Hades got home, he barely made it over the threshold and closed the door before yanking at his robes, panting mess that he was.\r\n\t“There you are, Hades,” Hythlodaeus remarked, a dangerous lilt to his voice.\r\n\t“Hythlodaeus, please,” Hades groaned in pure desperation, beads of precum dripping from his excited length.\r\n\t“They’re napping?” Hades asked indignantly, following Hythlodaeus to the bathroom.\r\n\t“You will get what you want eventually.” Hythlodaeus entangled his fingers in Hades’s hair, guiding him down to his knees.\r\n\tHades moaned as he took Hythlodaeus’s soft cock into his mouth, lavishing his partner with fervor.\r\n\tOnce hard, Hythlodaeus began to slowly thrust down Hades’s throat, driving him to reach down and pleasure himself as he moaned around his owner’s cock.\r\n\tAn excited whimper escaped Hades as he rushed to please, bending himself over and giving Hythlodaeus full view of his ass as he reached back and grasped the toy by the base.\r\n\tWith some difficulty, Hades obeyed.\r\n\tHades came uncontrollably as his partner worked him over, and soon enough Hythlodaeus let him collapse to the floor to regain his breath.\r\n\t“But…but what about you?” Hades managed to ask, gaze going to Hythlodaeus stiffness.\r\n\t“We could…” Hades studied Azem’s cock.\r\n\tAzem obeyed as they stifled a yawn, but Hades less so.\r\n\t“Hades, behave,” Hythlodaeus warned, gaze like daggers.\r\n\t“You’re still riled up?” Azem asked as Hades begrudgingly sat across from them.\r\n\t“I want to serve you, not mere replicas!” Hades retorted hotly.\r\n\tAzem raised an eyebrow when Hades didn’t finish his comment, his face flushed and his gaze making it clear his mind had wandered off.\r\n\t“I want you to…to… I want you both inside me, at the same time,” Hades admitted, causing Azem’s smirk to broaden.\r\n\t!” Hades exclaimed indignantly.\r\n\tSmirking, he grabbed Hades by the jaw, pulled him away from their slit, and up to the other side of their shaft.\r\n\tAzem’s head flung back, whimpers of delight rumbling in their chest as Hythlodaeus and Hades both worked their shaft, their breaths coming in short gasps, lightheadedness taking them as the scenario threatened to overwhelm them.\r\n\tTo their other side, he had gone as far as to bind Hades in lavender tendrils to make him behave.\r\n\t“Perhaps I should have you watch while I take care of our dear Hades?\r\n\tAfter laying them on a nearby chaise and covering them with a blanket, he turned his devilish smile to the bound and painfully excited Hades.\r\n\t“Why not?” Hades scoffed.\r\n\t“Dealt with—?” Hades started to ask, but fell silent as Hythlodaeus’s fingers entangled with his hair, nudging him downward.\r\n\t“Be good for me,” Hythlodaeus purred, guiding Hades’s mouth to his shaft.\r\n\tHades eagerly set about the task of worshipping Hythlodaeus’s length, fingers digging into his hips.\r\n\tA moan rumbled in Hades’s throat as Hythlodaeus began to slowly thrust his hips, fingers remaining in Hades’s hair.\r\n\tTendrils began to coil tighter around Hades probing his body.\r\n\tHythlodaeus pulled Hades’s mouth from his cock, watching his face as he eased several tendrils into his ass, several others coiling around his cock and balls.\r\n\t“More,” Hades begged, drool trickling from the corner of his mouth as he stared up at Hythlodaeus.\r\n\tHythlodaeus smiled as he watched Hades writhe in answer to getting his wish—a larger tendril pressing into him, the smaller ones spreading him to make room.\r\n\tHades reached for his own cock with a groan, but Hythlodaeus swiftly bound his arms behind his back, then guided him forward again.\r\n\t“Good boy…” Hythlodaeus groaned as Hades took him fully into his throat, his toes curling as climax neared.\r\n\tHe eased Hades off him again, lifting the man into the air with his tendrils, a sadistic smile spreading across his face as he watched Hades writhe in anticipation.\r\n\t“Azem’s…?” Hades’s gaze shifted over to their slumbering partner, a shiver running through him at the thought.\r\n\t“Perhaps a touch of training?” Hythlodaeus purred, resting his dick against Hades’s ass—and the tendrils languidly lavishing it.\r\n\tHe traced fingers over Hades’s thighs as he guided their aetheric tendrils to coil up his partner’s shaft.\r\n\t“Please, Hythlodaeus,” Hades whispered, writhing against his bonds.\r\n\tHythlodaeus chuckled as a tendril filled Hades’s mouth, another, much smaller one, slowly working its way into his dick at the same time.\r\n\tHades’s eyes rolled back with pleasure as he quickly gave into the varied affections, a deep moan rumbling from his chest as Hythlodaeus carefully began to work him apart.\r\n\t“You’re doing so well for me,” Hythlodaeus purred, cupping Hades’s face in one hand.\r\n\tHythlodaeus pressed against Hades gently again, and this time he gave way to his partner’s affections.\r\n\tMuffled by the tendril working his throat, all Hades could do was whimper with pleasure as Hythlodaeus and his tendrils swiftly brought him to climax, his mind going fuzzy as the myriad sensations threatened to overwhelm him, the murmured praise from his partner sending shivers through his very soul.\r\n\t“Too much?” Hythlodaeus questioned quietly, stroking Hades’s hair—a shake of the head received in answer.\r\n\tHythlodaeus leaned over Hades, kissing him deep as he continued to slowly work himself deeper into his partner.\r\n\tThis time, Hythlodaeus would forgive Hades for using his powers whilst bound.\r\n\tEventually, Hythlodaeus withdrew from the kiss and gripped Hades’s jaw, lips curving into a mischievous smile.\r\n\tHades cried out in ecstasy, body bending and shuddering against his bonds as he obeyed the command despite the tendril massaging the interior of his dick.\r\n\tWhen Hythlodaeus released in him with a low, purring groan, Hades passed out, overwhelmed.\r\n\t“Heh…” Hythlodaeus withdrew from Hades, keeping him suspended in his tendrils.\r\n\tIf you'd love to have more stories to read, come join us at Emet-Selch's Book Club, a wonderful community of authors and readers!\r\n\tHades slept on his other side, head on his stomach.\r\n\tHe raised an eyebrow, lifting one of the vials—how had Azem managed to absorb that much of the aphrodisiac without becoming worse off than Hades?\r\n\tHythlodaeus watched in disbelief as Hades straddled the groggy Azem and eased himself onto their length.\r\n\tAzem grumbled blearily and rubbed at their eyes before peering up at Hades.\r\n\t“Fill me,” Hades groaned as he rode Azem’s shaft.\r\n\tHythlodaeus silenced Hades with a deep kiss, hand loosely wrapped around his throat and pulling him back.\r\n\tHades shuddered and moaned as Hythlodaeus pressed into him alongside Azem, the pleasure threatening to overwhelm him in an instant.\r\n\t“T-tight…” Azem gasped before biting the back of their hand, trying to keep themselves from falling to the friction of Hythlodaeus’s shaft against theirs within Hades.\r\n\tHythlodaeus broke his kiss with Hades to look down at Azem, studying them as they struggled and writhed, their cloudy gaze fixated on Hades’s hips as they matched Hythlodaeus’s speed, thrusting into their partner as he withdrew.\r\n\tThere’s no need for you to control yourself—isn’t that right, Hades?” “Please,” Hades groaned, shuddering on his partners’ cocks.\r\n\tHythlodaeus looked to Azem again, this time in a way they recognized well—he wanted to truly break Hades, and that was not done by giving him what he wanted.\r\n\t“And what has possessed you to give us orders this morning?” Hythlodaeus murmured by Hades’s ear, his fingers caressing over his torso.\r\n\t“I am begging you,” Hades exclaimed in defense.\r\n\tI—” Azem slowly rolled their hips deep into Hades as Hythlodaeus held him in place, causing him to squirm and moan in desperation.\r\n\tHades shuddered, his concentration swiftly crumbling against his partners’ slow, sensuous affections.\r\n\t“Ours,” Hythlodaeus interjected, feeling Hades and Azem both twitch in response to his tone.\r\n\t“Don’t you want to let go?” Azem’s question made Hades shudder, his gaze glossing over.\r\n\tA soft moan in reply as Hades’s mind flitted to fantasies of serving his partners, his ass clenching tight as his thoughts began to blur, his breaths coming in short pants.\r\n\tSo unbecoming for the one who held the title of Emet-Selch.\r\n\t“Please…” Hades shuddered as Hythlodaeus’s fingers traced down his abdomen.\r\n\t“There, was that so difficult?” Hythlodaeus brushed his lips over the ridge of Hades’s ear, his fingers grasping Hades’s length.\r\n\t“Slowly,” Azem added, resting a hand on Hades’s thigh.\r\n\tAzem bit their lower lip as they ceased their movements and watched as Hades obeyed, his flushed body settling into an entrancing rhythm above them, his hips rolling and rotating as he sought to please both of them.\r\n\t“Look at him, orchestrating his own downfall…” Hythlodaeus chuckled as he kept his hand around Hades’s cock, letting him thrust into his hand while he worked.\r\n\tTheir breath hitched as Hades shifted and buried his face in their throat, lavishing them with lips, tongue, and teeth, ruining their train of thought entirely.\r\n\tFor his part, he began thrusting into Hades, well aware the esteemed Convocation member could no longer focus enough to please him.\r\n\tSparks flew up his spine as he felt Azem come deep inside of Hades, their length twitching against his, their hot seed coating them boat.\r\n\tToes curling, he allowed himself his release, shuddering as he dug his fingers into Hades’s hips.\r\n\tWhen he withdrew, he raised a brow as Azem rolled Hades off them.\r\n\t“Are you…” Azem took a moment to regain their breath, then sat up, Hades’s come dripping down their chest and abs.\r\n\t“Oh?” Hythlodaeus murmured, running a finger up Azem’s come-soaked belly, expression darkening as he glanced over at Hades.\r\n\tIf you'd love to have more stories to read, come join us at Emet-Selch's Book Club, a wonderful community of authors and readers!\r\n\tI post various poses of my WoL\/Azem, Hythlodaeus, and Hades.\r\n\tHades, you were right!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hello, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You hear Hythlodaeus chuckling, sprawled at your side on top of Emet-Selch like he doesn't have a care in the world, and you begin to laugh as well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch says nothing, but his grip tightening on your waist is telling enough before he pulls you and Hythlodaeus down for an embrace."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You shouldn’t be here, Emet-Selch frowns, black robe dusted off if only for the sake of appearance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You know Emet-Selch is just using it as an excuse to take advantage and compose himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch, however, remains as frowny as ever."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s voice makes you jump, realizing that you’d zoned out during his lecture."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You jab your finger against Emet-Selch's chest without a care in the world, enjoying the look of surprise you get from him as a reward."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch narrows his eyes and looks about to shoot something back before a gentle pressure on your shoulder pulls you backwards, making you collide against something—or rather,  someone —solid and warm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh, that makes you feel even warmer, a silly grin forming on your face, however Emet-Selch looks like Hythlodaeus has just sworn war on his kingdom (or empire, rather,  you muse)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I missed you too, Hades.\r\n\tVery much so, and maybe it is the way you are smiling, maybe it is that you have just used his name or maybe it's the sight of you and Hythlodaeus together again, but you see Emet-Selch’s frown slowly disappear before he lets out a dramatic sigh in his own Emet-Selch-way, and smiles."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Don’t you think so, Hades?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A clap startles you as Hythlodaeus gently places an arm on Emet-Selch’s shoulder while keeping you close with the other."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch clicks his tongue."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus cackles in delight, a clear contrast to Emet-Selch’s scowl."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A sudden idea pops into your mind and you gaze upon both Emet-Selch and Hythlodaeus with eager eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Perhaps it’s due to your soul still being incomplete, Emet-Selch nods, thoughtful."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus chuckles as Emet-Selch rolls his eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Since you and Hades were close friends in the Convocation, it was often him who ended up with Pashtarot’s reports on your discipline."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Why, he almost made Hades here take your habit of disappearing whenever he so much as put a foot in his office!\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch asks, but you shake your head once again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You told me how Emet-Selch joined the Convocation, Hythlodaeus nods at that while Emet-Selch sputters an indignant  \"surely you did not—!\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What say you, Hades?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch, at your left, shifts in place, and you notice he'ss almost,  almost,  hiding his face from you at his side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One thing is very, very clear: Hythlodaeus loves his stories as much as Emet-Selch loves adding his own dramatic flair to them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It's in his gesturing while holding both of your hands in his own; in his smiles as he tells the story of a younger, tinier, and always frowning Emet-Selch as he fought to control his special power to see the colour of souls and how he'd decided to approach him, knowing they shared the same hardship; and on the fondness in his voice as he adds tidbits of their growth together, like how they stopped seeing their power as a burden that only gave them headaches back then and learned how to master it despite the difficulties."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There's a beat of silence before you hear Emet-Selch clear his throat at your side, but when Hythlodaeus wiggles his eyebrows playfully you can't hold it in and burst out laughing, unable to stop despite Emet-Selch groaning something that sounds suspiciously like \"incorrigible\"."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, please, don't be shy.\r\n\tAnd then Emet-Selch's expression turns into a wicked smile.\r\n\tYou suddenly understand Emet-Selch's reaction a little better, but you find yourself unable to look at him straight to his face.\r\n\tYou met me first, when both Hades and I were about to graduate from the Akadaemia,\" Hythlodaeus smiles at you, like he's remembering another event he's fond of."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You beam with pride at Emet-Selch, whose brows are giving him away despite him doing his best to hide his surprise in your eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The braid was yours and Hades' idea a bit after I got my position as Chief of the Bureau of the Architect…\" Emet-Selch cuts in."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch sighs like he wants to send his soul away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And how, pray tell, you start, sending your best smile in Emet-Selch's direction, \"did I meet this wonderful man?\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch narrows his eyes while Hythlodaeus outright cackles, looking like he's enjoying every second of it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And I still haven't forgiven him for it, Emet-Selch mumbles."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I told you that back then when we met, both of us were getting ready to graduate on top of our peers, so we spent most of our time in the Capitol library… and then he looks at Emet-Selch with a mischievous glint in his violet eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch scoffs next to you, but Hythlodaeus ignores him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So my good childhood friend, this  lovely  partner of mine, Emet-Selch steps in, sarcasm dripping from his every syllable, \"decided to send a relentless madwoman carrying  a bowl of fruit  my way.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's expression turns into something akin to fondness, his amber eyes lost somewhere far away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch purses his lips together and glares at Hythlodaeus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus leans forward with interest while Emet-Selch raises an eyebrow yet again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This time  both  their brows raise before Emet-Selch gives you a tiny smirk."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It's a warm colour, one that shines very brilliantly too, and with a smirk that usually spells trouble, he adds: \"I always thought it matched Hades' eyes quite well.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Before you can question what you're doing yourself, you turn your head to look directly into a very wide-eyed Emet-Selch, who leans back like he's trying to escape your gaze."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch swallows."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch clears his throat while you put your heart over your chest, begging your heart to stop pounding like it wants to escape into the sea of souls and never come back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Every painful experience, every joy you felt, every little surprise you planned… One look from our dear Hades and we'd know everything.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His sudden firm grip on your arms startle you and you find yourself eye-to-eye again with Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's hands, still gripping your arms like they're a lifeline to him, tremble as he leans closer to you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I can see, Emet-Selch murmurs, his voice low and almost a whisper, \"a soul so brilliant, it made me look twice the first moment I saw you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There’s a warning in Emet-Selch’s eyes as he gazes at the figure behind you, but by then it’s too late."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It’s like the weight is back on Emet-Selch’s shoulders as they drop with a sigh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When we met you, Hades and I were still trying to figure out where we stood with each other, but we had made some… advances.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch lets out something that sounds suspiciously like a snort."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch crosses his arms, brow furrowed in thought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades— Like Hades said, we don’t want to compromise the life you still have to live.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You shake your head  no, to which Emet-Selch seems to mutter something that sounds like \"stubborn.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For a moment, both are silent until Emet-Selch heaves out a sigh so long you think he might just poof out of existence."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There’s a few seconds of silence, although to you they feel like an eternity before Hythlodaeus turns to Emet-Selch, who sighs again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You think Emet-Selch has had enough of it for a lifetime."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Do I have to say  please, Emet-Selch?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh, my dear Hades.\r\n\tEmet-Selch sighs once more, exasperated, and you  almost  feel bad for him, if a part of you didn’t whisper it was all a front for the man.\r\n\tWhen Emet-Selch begins to walk away, you hurry to his side, Hythlodaeus quickly catching up.\r\n\tYou’d attained your seat at the Convocation and had worked hard to get Hades as the one recommended for Emet-Selch’s seat.\r\n\tEmet-Selch groans at your side, speeding up the pace like he wants to escape his lover’s teasing.\r\n\tEmet-Selch raises an eyebrow as he looks at you before shaking his head, the ghost of a smile appearing in his face.\r\n\tYou can see it as clear as day when you close your eyes: the same room you’d seen before in your head, with a tired Emet-Selch with rumpled hair and clothes laying atop the middle of the bed.\r\n\tThat,\" Emet-Selch interrupts you a bit  too  fast, \"is not true."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You just liked to put up a front whenever we brought it up,\" he grins like the cat who’s caught its prey, and all Emet-Selch can do is squint at the man like he’s committed a grave offense."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Hades was tired—don’t look at me like that—we pushed him there so he’d get proper rest and plenty of cudd– You snort and Hythlodaeus shrugs at Emet-Selch’s finger being pointed at his face before turning to you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One time you were being extremely stubborn about it, and Hades here just outright teleported himself in our living room dragging you with him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was a rare occurrence, Emet-Selch adds, \"but he always had the  annoying  habit of looking out for us over his own health, and  then it was our turn to watch over his wellbeing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus bursts out laughing again, much to your delight, and you find yourself at the end of one of Emet-Selch’s frowns, to which you answer with an innocent look."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He missed you whenever you left, you know, Hythlodaus says, ignoring the look Emet-Selch sends his way."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not ‘nothing’, it was always  something, Emet-Selch answers instead, eyes lost forward into the nothingness as you walk."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Come now, Hades, she knew you as well as I did: down to your very heart, no matter how deep you try to hide it.\r\n\tEmet-Selch shakes his head stubbornly, yet you know, deep down, Hythlodaeus is right.\r\n\tEmet-Selch and Hythlodaeus are a few steps behind, the former looking down with his hair covering his expression while Hythlodaeus looks at him with a curious but worried look.\r\n\tEmet-Selch’s fists are clenched.\r\n\tEmet-Selch raises his head and for a moment you see nothing but horror cross his features.\r\n\tI could bear the loneliness if it was for you, my dear Hades, just as you bore it for us.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Hythlodaeus holds Emet-Selch’s face between his hands you decide to turn around and look away, feeling your heart about to burst."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There’s a hint of a smile in Emet-Selch’s voice when he speaks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch repeats the question like it’s an insult in his mouth, stepping towards you like he’s about to  pounce."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch ignores him as he grabs your arms once more to stare you down with his golden eyes and keep you in place, like he’s stopping you from running away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The grip in your arms tightens again before Hythlodaeus gently places his hand on his his shoulder, pulling Emet-Selch back to his collected self."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I’m so sorry I left you alone for all these years, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This is our Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You hold him back with all your strength, and when you spot Hythlodaeus over Emet-Selch’s shoulder, looking at you two with nothing but fondness and  something  else you cannot pinpoint in his eyes, you scowl and pull him over by his sleeve."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Both you and Emet-Selch ignore the soulseer’s squawk of surprise and drag him into Emet-Selch’s chest at your side the moment you get him within reach."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Daeus, Emet-Selch warns with a low voice that sends shivers down your spine, but then you feel his smile against your neck before he drops a kiss there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades–!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s voice sounds rough iand strained n your ear, like he’s holding himself back (and the thought makes you want to shake him by his robe) ,  and his next words leave your body trembling even harder."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch finally loosens his grip on you, but you don’t try to step away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s hands rest atop of yours, still gripping his robe."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I’ll come visit soon, you say, seeing Hythlodaeus waving and Emet-Selch looking at you with a genuine smile, one happier than the one you last saw in Ultima Thule."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Good morning, Daeus, Hades.\r\n\tI owe you guys that-oh who am I kidding I want to write it-and Azem deserves her revenge too lol, as much as Emet and Hythlo deserve both a rest and lots of loving.\r\n\tEmet-Selch had tuned out somewhere around the statistical likelihood of the onset of estrous becoming more likely with each passing year after sexual maturity, an indefinite cycle infuriating with its seeming randomness, the length of which apparently changing from person to person.\r\n\tEmet-Selch does not need anything, thank you very much.\r\n\tYou know that the ban on the permanent alteration of biological functions has not changed, Emet-Selch,\" Loghrif says with a patient but amusedly curling smile, looking side-along at him through the holes in her mask, \"Concept Matrices for contraceptives are freely available and widely used, I still fail to see what the issue is."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch.\r\n\tShe's making fun of him, and Emet-Selch is going to go ahead and blame Azem for setting the example.\r\n\tThough he does not deign to respond, in a final show of an utter lack of professionalism, her voice echoes after him, You're awfully moody, Emet-Selch!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch has no idea where he made a name for himself as the de facto solution to such problems, but while it is not strictly in his job description, he would nevertheless consider himself not adequately fulfilling the obligations of his duty to their fair city should he refuse to render aid."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His office surprisingly offers no reprieve from the weather, remaining obstinately of a similar temperature, resulting in an Emet-Selch who is mortifyingly rumpled, and in a very foul mood indeed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch.\r\n\tEmet-Selch blinks, feeling stupid and more distracted besides.\r\n\tHe knows precisely which practical jokes Emet-Selch is referring to, of course, as he likely eagerly assisted in pioneering them with their aggravatingly creative partner.\r\n\tNo,\" Hythlodaeus is quick to reassure him, bowl and fork abandoned in favor of reaching across the desk to snag Emet-Selch's sleeve, winding those clever fingers around Emet-Selch's wrist."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His hands are wonderfully cool, deceptively strong, and for an embarrassing moment, Emet-Selch is certain that Hythlodaeus must be able to feel his pulse quicken under the press of his thumb."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Would that I had the luxury, Emet-Selch remarks dryly, casting a pointed look first to the stack of paperwork that has been abandoned for the sake of his morning running around after errant concepts and then to the man responsible for it, \"But  someone  had me running across the city all morning, and now I'm behind.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He at least has the decency to look sheepish, but that doe-eyed look from beneath long lashes reminds Emet-Selch in explicit detail of the last time he saw it: with Hythlodaeus on his knees, red mouth wrapped around his-- This is neither the place nor the time for him to indulge a trip down a somewhat inappropriate memory lane, and if Emet-Selch is honest with himself, he's both horrified and embarrassed by the sudden intrusion of thought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Clearly, the man's presence was absolutely the problem to begin with, as even in his absence the smell of lilacs persists, every bit as strongly as if Emet-Selch had pressed his nose to Hythlodaeus's nape and inhaled his scent from there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The painfully loud thud that follows is absolutely the sound of Emet-Selch's forehead hitting the desk in the vain hope that more.. percussive maintenance will assist in getting him back on track with his looming paperwork."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It is for this reason that when the next knock on his office door comes, Emet-Selch is pacing his floor like a man hunted, and having no luck for it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lahabrea, He says, more an observation than a greeting, voice hoarse and rough with want (not need, Emet-Selch does not need) in a way that surprises even him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What it is he's looking at is Emet-Selch, of course, hair damp and curling with perspiration, flushed from his nose to the tips of his ears and in a wash of pink down his throat and disappearing into his robes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What he's looking at is Emet-Selch, fidgety with the desperate urge to palm himself through his clothes like an overwrought youth, plainly and obviously painfully erect even through his robes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Absolutely not, Lahabrea says bluntly, stepping around Emet-Selch to deposit a file on his desk, \"And don't sulk, Emet-Selch, I am  busy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It's not unreasonable, and however much there  is a whine building in Emet-Selch's throat, it's more for his pitiable situation than it is for anything else."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You're worse than useless out of your mind in heat as you are,\" The near violent protestation dies in Emet-Selch's throat at the pointed look from head to toe that Lahabrea gives him, pushing him into petulant silence, \"And as free advice, change things."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He's also not wrong about the friction-- even debilitated by his body's attempt to force him to procreate, altering its basic form is as easy as breathing to a mage as accomplished as Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch can, at least, maintain some semblance of dignity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus is particularly fond of it, in fact, Hythlodaeus is the one who suggested it initially, and then took a near fanatical amount of delight in making Emet-Selch cum so hard he couldn't stand, several consecutive times."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Both of them and, Emet-Selch imagines, must smell like him, too."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is loathe to be a noisy lover, easily embarrassed however much his partners enjoy it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By his third orgasm, Emet-Selch realizes the need is not going to abate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He's quick and attentive, always, coming to Emet-Selch's side to push his sweat damp hair out of his face and kiss his jaw, his ear in gentle greeting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He runs a soothing hand down Emet-Selch's back, and it's a testament to how thoroughly into the throes of his heat he is that he can't think of anything but how he wants those strong hands lower, gripping his ass and spreading him open-- Azem says, fumbling his way out of his robes before dropping into bed beside Emet-Selch and mouthing at his shoulder."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You're gorgeous, Hades, but I want to be the one putting you in that state.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Cool, Emet-Selch says, clearing his throat and reaching for Azem as he goes into the bathroom."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Azem looks over him now with a concern that Emet-Selch would find irritating if he wasn't so sticky and tired and uncomfortable."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He refuses to admit it, but the tender look in Azem's eyes as he goes about filling the bath, making sure Emet-Selch's knees cooperate long enough for him to get into it, settling in behind him and kissing the salt from his shoulder fills him with an unusual sense of peace."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus too-- it was only Emet-Selch left who had never been subjected to it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Azem is humming as he pulls a cup from thin air and uses it to rinse Emet-Selch's hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Azem's hands do nothing to help matters, lingering where they touch and, once clean, settling on his chest and belly to splay across them, the edge of a thumb dragged back and forth over one of Emet-Selch's nipples."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aha, The redhead says, grinning and coaxing Emet-Selch to lay back against him, even if he is far shorter, \"Welcome back to the land of the lucid, bright eyes.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Give over, Azem laughs at him, pinching his nipple hard enough to wring a particularly uncharitable groan from Emet-Selch, only ameliorated by the fact that his lover's own dick is burning a brand into his lower back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Everyone goes through it, Hades, like it or not.\r\n\tHe carries on like this for a few times more until Emet-Selch is gasping like a dying man with each denied orgasm.\r\n\tEmet-Selch is on his belly with Azem enthusiastically wringing a litany of breathy cries from him as he fucks him within an inch of his life by the time Hythlodaeus makes it home.\r\n\tAzem is short, near comedically so, but what he lacks in stature he certainly makes up for in strength and endurance and  damned cruelty, if the fact that he's determined to abuse Emet-Selch's prostate as much as humanly possible without allowing him to actually cum is anything to go by.\r\n\tHe even gives their mutual lover a cheerful wave before nipping at the back of Emet-Selch's neck to make him whine and shudder.\r\n\tEmet-Selch knows this, knows that they both are very much affected by it, the pageantry of protest along with it.\r\n\tYou have to learn patience, Hades,\" Azem laughs, pulling back to look down and watch his cock disappear into his lover again and again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Azem says, and Emet-Selch can't help flushing to the tips of his ears because he absolutely knows the intention behind the statement."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It's a quick shift, Azem pulls out and then a second later the magic does its work and Emet-Selch, and he's sitting back and tugging Emet-Selch into his lap, back to chest, to press right back into his arse before he even really has chance to miss it, fingers finding his clit and working it to make him squirm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Before, Emet-Selch might have been tempted to say that it was a prostate that made such things enjoyable, and yet this is scientific evidence to the contrary."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No instead, he gets Hythlodaeus's mouth, greedy and eager, closing over his clit to suck so enthusiastically that Emet-Selch's thighs reflexively shake."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Azem has spent so long edging him that it's a very near miss, but much to Emet-Selch's extreme displeasure, Hythlodaeus manages to pull off right before he peaks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It's the same now, Hythlodaeus is quiet as a mouse and intent with concentration as he settles between their spread legs, rubbing the head of his cock between Emet-Selch's wet folds."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And much to Emet-Selch's mild annoyance, Azem was right."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It's short-lived, really, especially when Hythlodaeus moves first, his cock dragging over every single tortuously pleasurable inch of Emet-Selch's channel, pressed in tight quarters by Azem."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And then Azem shifts, adjusting his angle just enough that Hythlodaeus's hips drop, pushing  up  and in, and Emet-Selch swears he goes blind for a moment when his lover's cock pushes at  just  the right angle to hit that spot within him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The pair share what Emet-Selch can only assume is a terrifying look of agreement, because then they're both moving and all he can feel is a pressure inside him that he can't place, that familiar tightness from before along with it, growing to an alarming degree until-- \"That's it, let go,\" Hythlodaeus murmurs, somehow both soothing and demanding, and pushes his fingers low on Emet-Selch's belly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a hoarse shout and no other warning, Emet-Selch cums, each tight clench of his body accompanied by what can only be described as a hot  gush  that leaves him shaking and whining."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh, fuck, Azem near sobs, forehead buried against Emet-Selch's shoulder, he and Hythlodaeus both fucking him through it, chasing their own orgasms."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Had he a single thought left in his mind, Emet-Selch might find it somewhat satisfying to know that it was hot enough and experience for them to push both near immediately into their own shared climax, but as it is, he's damn near asleep by the time the aftershocks fade."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus laughs once they catch their breath, buoyed by a bizarre love over the whole display and gently taking up a by now virtually comatose Emet-Selch into his arms to gently lay him in the bed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Whether this one event would be enough to put an end to Emet-Selch’s cycle is a mystery for the morning, but for now, not one of them is inclined to do anything other than tangle like ancient vines and rest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But neither does it turn out to be quite the ordeal Emet-Selch had so vehemently protested being subjected to.)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus laughed and pressed his lips against Emet-Selch’s neck."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus moved his hands from Emet-Selch’s hips, reaching around him to grasp at the hem of Azem’s robe and tug."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The loose cloth fell forgotten to the floor, and Azem stepped on it and kissed Emet-Selch again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If Emet-Selch had been prone to pointless imaginings, he might have spent unconscionable lengths of time considering what Azem looked like underneath their robe."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch grew still."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus wrapped his arms around Emet-Selch, a comforting motion, as if anchoring him in the present."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “A good memory?” Emet-Selch said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And Hades had not the slightest idea where he was."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades did not have time for this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades moved before his thoughts caught up with him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hello, Hades,” Hythlodaeus said, bright and cheerful and oh so amused."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This close, Hades could clearly see his eyes behind his mask, mischievous as always."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades breathed deeply and forced himself to think rationally."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’s scowl deepened and he stalked toward the decrepit structure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades ignored him and flung open the door."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades squinted, unable to see through the darkness, and so it was that the stench hit him first."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A curse escaped Hades’s lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Their mouth formed the shape of words—Hades, Hythlodaeus—but no sound escaped them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No matter what they later chose to specialize in, whether it was concept creation like Hythlodaeus or esoteric magicks like Hades, all students received the same basic education."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And yet, for all that he had taken the required courses with the Words of Emmerololth and passed with highest honors, Hades was finding that he really knew nothing at all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked down at them, hating what he was about to ask, hating what he thought he might see."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades growled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I never thought I’d see the day when Hades requested that you disrobe for him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades drew in a sharp gasp."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades paid him no mind; he had other concerns."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was not prepared for this, and he was more frightened than he’d ever been in his life."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I will hit you,” Hades said, and meant it not at all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus nodded when Hades met his eyes, and Hades looked down at their patient."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades rocked back on his heels and tried to think."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” Hythlodaeus said quietly, and Hades turned."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Be careful,” Hades said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades drew a shaky breath and turned back to the bed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That’s a fish,” Hades said, just to be sure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades knew immediately of whom he spoke: a young woman who gave off an air of impatience and constant distraction, as if she’d rather be attending to her studies than spending time with a class of youngsters."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades knew what Hythlodaeus was implying."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Did it work?” Hades asked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades paid him no mind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had long been aware that this youth was beloved of trouble, chaos following them wherever they went."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’re staring, Hades.” Their irises were still white: Hades didn’t think he’d ever seen them go so long without changing their appearance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades breathed a sigh of exasperation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That is an astonishingly terrible suggestion,” Hades said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We’re on the far continent,” they said, confirming what Hades and Hythlodaeus had already suspected."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And you didn’t punch it?” Hades said, taking refuge in sarcasm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could well imagine it: his friend recklessly throwing themself between a stranger and a beast and having their stomach clawed out in return."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The conviction in their voice was so absolute that Hades couldn’t bring himself to argue."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even so, the traveler whispered, “She’ll come,” and Hades had not the heart to argue."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades gazed through the hole in the roof up at the stars above: they were utterly unfamiliar, different constellations than what he had always seen in Amaurot and studied at the Akadaemia."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades clicked his tongue."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I wish exams were our greatest concern,” Hades said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If you’d known better, you would have realized I was avoiding you,” Hades rejoined."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That was not the part that caught Hades’s attention."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades wondered what that was supposed to mean, but he refused to rise to the bait."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades.” Hades didn’t think."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Next time you do it then,” Hades growled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades has everything well in hand.” Hades rolled his eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even so, neither Hades nor Hythlodaeus slept that night."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stood gazing at the eastern wall for some time, where the claws of some great beast had gouged through the soft, rotted wood."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades and Hythlodaeus had a quick muttered discussion, at the conclusion of which Hades reluctantly agreed to investigate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades tried not to think about the zoology exam he had by now missed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They scattered upon Hades’s approach, and he looked down at the remains of the creature."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not for the first time, Hades found himself reluctantly impressed by his friend’s strength."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades refused to think about what would happen then."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Hades returned to the cabin, the half-rotted table was littered with squares of paper of all colors."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus listened to him with half an ear, turning one of the papers over and over as Hades described his findings."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hythlodaeus,” Hades said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades shook his head, disgusted, and walked over."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades…” Hades narrowed his eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’s brows drew together."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades, take a look at this, will you?” Hades shot one last glare at the traveler and walked over."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus passed him a sheet of offensively loud pink paper, and Hades squinted at it suspiciously."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stared at the schematic in his hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You had this ready?” Hades asked, unable to hide his skepticism."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stared at the plans for the equine, lifted his gaze and stared at Hythlodaeus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I only wish you’d put your mind to it more often,” Hades retorted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As he stood in front of the cabin, watching it toss its head restlessly and paw at the grass, Hades reluctantly admitted to himself that Hythlodaeus had judged correctly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not that Hades would say as much."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades started."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had not the strength to make another."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Instead Hades said, “What do you have there?” “How is it that you can identify medicinal herbs and suggest culinary atrocities in the same breath?” Hades said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He grabbed for Hades’s sleeve, herbs scattering across the ground as he did."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades paused, startled, and glanced back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus’s eyes shone with utmost seriousness, and he said, so low that only Hades could hear, “We’ll make it through this.” He was trying to encourage Hades in his own way."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades gently detached himself from his friend’s grasp and stepped inside."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus said, arrogance in his voice, that he’d known it would; Hades retorted that it was because of his efforts and nothing Hythlodaeus had contributed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Upon hearing that Hades had conjured up a flying lightning equine, the traveler immediately wanted to ride it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It took only a cursory inspection for Hades to know that it wouldn’t even last another night; he’d burned so much magic over the past two days that he no longer had the power to sustain it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Only when Hades was standing over his shoulder did he glance over with mild curiosity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stared down at the little craft project."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Even I can do this much, you know,” Hythlodaeus said into Hades’s silence."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades wanted to grab and shake him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That’s what you’ve been doing these past few days?” Hades hissed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Tell me, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades hesitated."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades paced outside to study the lightning beast again, as if that would lend it—and him—strength."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades didn’t pay him much mind, not until he heard Hythlodaeus suddenly snap, “Absolutely not.” Hades was on his feet in an instant, pushing open the door to the cabin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Not this again,” Hades said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I am tired of repeating the same argument,” Hades said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades couldn’t help it: for a moment, he imagined it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “How dare you,” Hades said, and his voice trembled with grief or with rage."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Because you have exams,” they said, and Hades’s breath caught, because he had never in his life heard something so foolish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And I suppose you don’t care to hear our opinions,” Hades said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” Hythlodaeus hissed, shocked out of his anger."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades ignored him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades continued, unable to stop, “What sort of person would throw themself unflinching into the path of a beast to save a child?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He lifted their joined hands, and Hades reached out, clasping their hands in his own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We’re not going anywhere,” Hades said, and that was the end of that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They knew—they would always know—when Hades declared an argument over."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades gave it approximately four hours, less than half the night, before the equine could no longer sustain itself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades frowned and nudged him in the side with his elbow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Their eyes were still closed; Hades didn’t know if they were listening or if it was merely a coincidence."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stared at him, then turned his gaze in the same direction."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades tensed, but as it emerged into the candlelight, he saw that it was only a small creature: a bird flying on wings of paper."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades could never clearly remember what happened after that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He was dozing off, his head leaning against Hades’s shoulder, and Hades didn’t have the heart to wake him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The door across from him opened, and Hades started violently."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Azem crossed the room in a few long strides and knelt before them; Hythlodaeus gasped sharply, and Hades tried very hard to keep his expression neutral."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You would be Hades and Hythlodaeus, right?” she said softly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades lost his fight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades opened his mouth to protest—what else were they to do?—but at Azem’s warm smile, the words caught in his throat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “They’ll be fine,” Azem said, and such was her bearing that Hades believed her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She placed a hand atop each of their heads, and only then did Hades realize with a flush of embarrassment that they’d forgotten to don mask and cowl."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “But—“ Hades began."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades stopped in the doorway, rocking back on his heels and staring; Hythlodaeus had no such reservations, feet carrying him forward until he stopped next to the bed, where the young traveler was propped up by a generous number of pillows."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades…” Hades took a deep breath and said the first thing he could think of."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades hesitated, but then he closed the distance between them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The traveler draped one arm around him and held out the other to Hades; reluctantly he leaned in, allowing himself to be drawn into a loose embrace."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We love you too,” Hythlodaeus said, when Hades couldn’t find it in him to respond."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After a moment, Hades closed his eyes and sighed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades and Hythlodaeus returned to Amaurot the following day, carrying a promise from their friend to visit as soon as they could make the journey."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades suspected he merely did not want to want to return to school, even though they had by now missed the last of their exams."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When the summons came from the administration, Hades was surprised to find that it was from the Akadaemia headmaster himself rather than his departmental dean."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades ignored him, greeting the headmaster with restrained courtesy and taking the seat that was offered him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had never spoken to him before, nor had Hythlodaeus; most of their interaction with the administration had been limited to the deans of their respective departments."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades found that he was holding his breath."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades tried his best to argue."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had been more occupied with the problems in front of him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A matching anger thrummed through Hades’s veins."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was with great dread that Hades looked down, fearing what he would find."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Graduating with honors?” Hythlodaeus whispered, and Hades realized at that moment that Hythlodaeus saw the same—that, in fact, he wasn’t misreading."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades too could find nothing to say."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “No, of course not,” Hades said quickly, before Hythlodaeus could get any ideas."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s hand trailed across the bare skin of their stomach, tracing the outlines of the scar he could feel but not see."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Surrounded by his lovers’ protests, Emet-Selch’s eyes drifted closed, and he smiled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Exarch—G’raha Tia, you reminded yourself—had avoided you at every turn since you’d returned from your confrontation with Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At least Emet-Selch did me the courtesy of being honest.” His eyes burn the selfsame fire you saw when he saved you from Emet-Selch, when he summoned the Warriors from beyond the rift in your direst moment, and you wonder if you underestimated your mark."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “A certain Ascian—Emet-Selch, he calls himself—informed me of my condition, that you willfully put upon me,” she snarls venomously."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A scene in-between; how Emet-Selch might interrogate the Exarch.Emet-Selch & Exarch, discussed WoL\/Exarch and WoL\/Emet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Implied Emet\/Exarch if that's your thing Emet-Selch drags a careless hand across his shoulders, slinking forward into his vision."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He once thought Emet-Selch's characteristic slouch was one of reckless depression, one only felt by someone who had truly seen everything existence could offer and found nothing of worth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch,” he grits out, “thank you so much for having me as your guest.” He struggles against the pain blooming in his chest to keep his voice light, airy, condescending."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Perhaps your time would have been utilized better.” Emet-Selch swirls a crystal wineglass with a careful rock of his wrist, the scarlet liquid lapping the rim, but not a drop spilling."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet pinches his chin between forefinger and thumb with deceptive delicacy, his soulless eyes glimmering as he tips the wineglass to his lips, enough for a swallow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And then he spits in Emet-Selch’s self-assured face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch rips off his pristine glove with his teeth and dashes the back of his hand across the Exarch’s face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You know nothing of her,” Emet-Selch seethes, “nothing of substance, nothing that matters."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The chilly anger in his timbre gives the Exarch pause, it was an angle he hadn’t considered: Emet-Selch, an Ascian, might care for the Warrior in some regard."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I consider her nothing but a pretty trinket, from one I used to hold dear,” Emet-Selch says airily, dominance once more established."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The crystal might have partially shielded his neck, but Emet-Selch applies crushing pressure to his windpipe."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A dizziness overtakes him, as if floating; at that instant, Emet-Selch releases him, and he heaves like a drowned man for the precious commodity of air."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And Emet-Selch smiles."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I can’t believe I didn’t realize,” you croak, “so wrapped up in my own head, so absorbed with my task, wrapped around Emet-Selch's finger…” “Although you should save your best punches for Emet-Selch’s smug face.” The matter of Emet-Selch was something else entirely, and you sensed neither of you had heard all there was to see in that matter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Fifteen years before the Exarch summoned the first Scion, Emet-Selch swaggered into the Ocular, surprising the Exarch into spilling his quills and papers all over his desk, stumbling to pick them up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch huffed, irritated."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was far from the last he’d heard of him; the very next morning Emet-Selch caught up with him as he was making his morning rounds, overseeing the nearly completed construction of the Musica Universalis."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That strut isn’t load-bearing,” Emet-Selch whispered, suddenly there, surprising him into yelping."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch chuckled, a dark, ugly sound."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch rolled his eyes, settled a hand on his slender hips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He did not see Emet-Selch until the following year."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Two months later Emet-Selch stormed into his office."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch.” He snapped."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Many, many, many years ago, yes,” Emet-Selch demurred."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This time Emet-Selch leaves a tin of tea on his desk."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A taste he would never be able to separate from Emet-Selch thereafter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Now we’re talking,” Emet-Selch grinned."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Exarch watched at Emet-Selch dumps six sugar cubes into his teacup, taking a sip before nodding his approval."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’m playing by a different set of cards than you,” Emet-Selch stated, “an unfair advantage, really."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If Emet-Selch could leap through time, there was little he would not know."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s vicious grin widened."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It took three cups of tea to work their way through Emet-Selch’s tale, so wild, so ridiculous it did not belie belief."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hydaelyn and Zodiark, a glimmering city he once called home, the Ascians… the Ascians were well-chronicled in the tales of the Warrior of Light’s adventures, and Emet-Selch filled in all the necessary gaps to paint a cohesive picture."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Are we not so alike?” Emet-Selch countered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" On the eve of the event, Emet-Selch visited again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Miss me, did you?” Emet-Selch crooned, setting another tin of tea on his desk beside his crystal hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’re summoning her, aren’t you?” Emet-Selch smiled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Good guess,” Emet-Selch smiled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Exarch grabbed his hand in both of his as Emet-Selch’s wrapped around his hood."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And it wouldn’t be very fun for either of us if I spoiled your secret, would it?” Emet-Selch purred."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He did not think any evening could approach the shame he felt when he took himself in hand and thought of Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “How long has it been?” Emet-Selch asked, his voice lined with velvet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And Emet-Selch lifted up his robe, fixing him with one last glimmering look before slipping aside his smalls and wrapping his mouth around his impossibly hard cock."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Merely canted his hips further into his scorching mouth, shuddering when Emet-Selch hummed his approval around his cock."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But he would be lying to himself if he didn’t desire Emet-Selch in just as profound of a way, a darkness snarling in his soul he could not escape, would not escape."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He came into his mouth with a shout, “Emet—!” clutching at the man’s hair from beneath his robes, tears at the edges of his eyes as he released onto his waiting tongue and lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I didn’t expect you to even last that long,” Emet-Selch chuckled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s hand came up to wrap around his throat, gently, promising."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Sometimes Zenos, sometimes Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Myriad cuts and scrapes across his chest, and the dark, puckered circle of his bullet wound courtesy of Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s interrogation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No one crawls into his head like Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 12 | promise » Emet → Azem, implied F!WoL\/G'raha, 2.3k, T.to tell someone one will certainly do, give, or arrange something."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The day Hades meets the woman who would one day come to be known as Azem happens to also be the last day he knows peace."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 18 | devil's advocate » Emet\/Exarch, mentions of ambiguous WoL, 0.6k, E.a person who expresses an opinion or takes a side they don't agree with in order to foster debate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch disagrees."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I avoided using the romantic relationship tag for a reason—if you're expecting requited Azem\/Emet, this may not be the piece for you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It is a no more than ordinary day when Hades meets the two most aggravating people in the star."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades starts, pulling away on instinct, only to see the voice belongs to a smiling woman with striking blue eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Nothing of your interest,” says Hades, pulling his tome away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The white-haired man pulls Hades’ tome away, skimming through the pages."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’ patience begins to run very, very thin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of course—no person who aims for the seat of Emet-Selch would not know the name of the man with the strongest affinity to the Underworld."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “A pleasure to make your acquaintance, Hades.” “Not pleased to meet me, Hades?” Hades frowns."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Well, Hades,” Hythlodaes begins, “my friend and I had been eyeing you for a while.” Hades did not know, at that point, that this was not going to be a choice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Weeks later, once Hades has accepted his fate, he asks Hythlodaeus a question."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You know full well what I’m talking about,” Hades insists."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Some of us are born with particular affinities, Hades, as I’m sure you’re aware.” He closes his tome with a smile, casting it aside."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades sighs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades hums thoughtfully."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I don’t know, Hades,” says Asteria, leaning too close for comfort."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades brushes her arm aside, earning himself a very overdramatic oh, I guess you just hate me, then."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “See, I can already imagine the announcements—Hades, Hythlodaeus and Asteria master the mysteries of affinity swapping."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades sighs, but there is, much to his chagrin, a smile tugging at the corner of his lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Perhaps friends weren’t too bad, Hades thinks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Willingly spending your spare time within the Words of Lahabrea?” Hades scoffs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh?” Hades quirks an eyebrow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I’d wager you’d be interested in it yourself, Hades.” Still, Hades finds himself fixated not on the latter part of it, but rather that name."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For unfortunate reasons, Hades might be compelled to say."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “See you, Hades!” Hades does not, in fact, pay a visit; at least not until circumstances force him otherwise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades!” Endymion greets upon his arrival, cyan eyes bright even under the cover of his mask."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Asteria didn’t come home last night,” says Hades, with little patience for pleasantries."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades frowns."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Endymion clears his throat, averting Hades’ gaze."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I see,” says Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “No, that was all,” says Hades, already turning on his heels."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She bolts away from the Convocation quarters before Hades has the chance to speak."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Azem!” Hades calls out, muttering apologies to the many people he bumps into on his way."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Tell me, most eminent Emet-Selch, what is the purpose of my seat, if when it comes to the outside, none of you will consider what I have to say?” Hades sighs, rubbing his temple."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Perhaps you can talk some sense into her,” Hades tells him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Perhaps she doesn’t need to have sense talked into her, Emet-Selch,” he says, turning cyan eyes in Hades’ direction."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Perhaps that”—he turns his back to Hades—”is something you should consider.” He follows Asteria without another word, leaving Hades alone with a tightness in his chest and a bitter taste in his mouth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I am trying,” Hades murmurs, “to understand you.” He takes a seat beside her, glancing up at the starry sky with a sigh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “If you ever knew me, Hades,” she says at last, after long moments of tense silence."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But not from you, Hades.” Her eyes flutter shut."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades has no answer for that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The streets are empty, only the echo of their steps breaking through the silence as Hades chases the shadow of Asteria’s back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You promised me you would try, Hades!” Frustration and concern overwhelm Hades in equal measure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I… I’ve heard enough, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You truly mean to leave,” Hades murmurs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Yes, Hades, I do,” she sighs, “and spare me the condescension."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He may opt to keep his features hidden for reasons that are yet beyond Hades’ understanding, but that mouth and its penchant for whispering the most aggravating things, the way his gaze follows her shade’s every movement, and the unmistakable color of that soul, sundered though it may be— Hades suddenly feels very, very tired."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades smiles."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This time, Hades does not look back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Despite his complaint, the look the Exarch shoots at Emet-Selch once the Ascian’s mouth comes off his cock can only be described as disappointment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Truly?” Emet-Selch quips, quirking an eyebrow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch runs his tongue along the underside of the Exarch’s shaft, thriving on the way it makes him shiver."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A long and harsh road, it had certainly been, but Emet-Selch might even be inclined to say it was worth it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Perhaps.” Emet-Selch smiles, crooked and devilish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Exarch’s eyes are dark and tarnished scarlet as they follow the movements of Emet-Selch’s hand, his words clearly struggling to catch up to his lust-addled mind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You wound me, sir,” Emet-Selch laughs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His crystal hand finds its way into Emet-Selch’s hair, making the latter smile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You realize that implies you do not agree with the point you’re arguing for yourself,” he huffs, nudging Emet-Selch forward."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Well, perhaps this may indeed not benefit your so honorably heroic goals,” Emet-Selch murmurs, low and heady."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And you, good sir,” Emet-Selch jeers, looking straight into those ruby eyes, gleaming like moonlit jewels, “certainly seem like you could use more indulgence.” Emet-Selch thinks it might be a little upsetting, when the time comes to finally kill him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And whoever the librarian was, in the end, he’s a creation of Emet-Selch’s."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “No wonder Emet-Selch wants to kill us so badly.” She’s seen the answer, perhaps, in the way she’d catch Emet-Selch looking at her, sometimes; when she’d say something that would make him ever imperceptibly falter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even Hades and Hythlodaeus, despite everything."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If you want something done right, Emet-Selch thought to himself, kill everyone and do it yourself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It made Emet-Selch tired."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Best of luck,” Emet-Selch snarled dismissively as Elidibus watched him turn away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch had to give the people of the First their due credit—they were a hardy folk."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch wondered who the leader was—but all the eddies and flows of people, guards, teachers, chirurgeons came and went from one central figure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch blinked hard and looked down."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch smiled as her small fist grew tighter on his robes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch saw a valuable asset in the child."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Nevertheless,” The Exarch murmured, scooping her into his arms and settling her on his hip, “I’d much prefer you stay within my sights.” The Exarch settled his gaze on Emet-Selch now—a gaze he could not see, but rather felt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A weaker man might have cowered, but Emet-Selch found himself intrigued."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Much like his fosterling, Emet-Selch wanted to hate the Crystal Exarch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His lips parted in a clenched gasp, his eyes roving over Emet-Selch’s robes and features."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch stood up, back aching as he corrected his slouch long enough to sink into a bow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch, at your service,” he demurred."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch waved a gloved hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This was a cruel world to be borne into, and not even Emet-Selch could immune himself from pity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lyna’s cheeks were ruddy as she sullenly watched the Exarch turn away and redirect his sights onto Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As Emet-Selch followed the Exarch through his half-constructed city, an unwilling king, a misfit in a misbegotten realm— Exarch\/Emet + Hyth\/Hades, hinted Hyth\/Hades\/Azem."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You must remember,” Emet-Selch tells him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He does not know if he fears or loves Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “There,” Emet-Selch whispers to him, stroking his bruised cheek with a gloved hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch shows him things."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And those are the worst—his head feels like it’ll explode like an overripe watermelon, sobbing and drooling in Emet-Selch’s lap as he pleads stop, stop, stop."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Makes a game of it—how long can he continue until Emet-Selch gets too tired of him, too frustrated."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A bald-faced lie, but something in it makes Emet-Selch’s features contort into sheer, utter rage."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Why,” Emet-Selch grates, “did you make me do that.” Emet-Selch leans down, taking a handkerchief out of his pocket with a flourish and dabbing at the blood on G’raha’s face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Dear boy,” Emet-Selch whispers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch threads his fingers through G’raha’s bloodslicked hair and pushes it out of his face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He can’t face the fact that when Emet-Selch—Hades, he bids him—kisses him, he returns it with an ardor he did not know he possessed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That holy blood runs in their veins, and perhaps something in G’raha—something primal, ferocity incarnate—kindles to that, because it’s a different sort of war in Hades’ bed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That’s all?” Hades drawls when Raha shoves himself in to the hilt, tossing his  head back with a deranged glee."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Raha can’t resist pumping, once, twice, before finding himself and dragging his hand—the crystal one, gilded fractures glimmering in the candelight—up the corpse-like cold of Hades’ chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’ golden eyes glimmer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “When she comes to us,” Hades tells him, conspiratorial, knotted together inextricably, “perhaps we can leave.” “Anywhere,” Hades mutters."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I don’t care,” Hades rasps, “so long as I have both of you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades tries to hide the truth from him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That’s not your name, dear boy,” Hades croons."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades eyes dance with delight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Perhaps this Hythlodaeus had been a lost companion for Hades, and saw him in Raha."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But he can tell Hades is panicking."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It’s not safe for you,” Hades tells him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He chokes on the word as Emet-Selch’s fist smashes into his cheek."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is gone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He will have to kill Hades if he leaves."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch whirls into your chambers in a flourish of umbral smoke, looking dry and comfortable as he looks down at  you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Perhaps it’s the battle still raging in your system, your distrust and hate boiling over, because before you can stop yourself you fling your mug of cooling tea at Emet-Selch’s smirking face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch settles himself on the edge of the kitchenette table, plucking an apple from the bowl and peering at it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You can’t help but press your nose into the furred collar as Emet-Selch comes down to sit beside you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I don’t suppose you’d believe me no matter my reasons for calling on you,” Emet-Selch gruffs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Perhaps another man may have taken his time, but Emet-Selch is not a patient man, not now, and you don’t need the preamble."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I’m— oh, gods, Emet—“ You wondered if he might push you away, but Emet-Selch, ever surprising you, kisses your damp forehead, nuzzling your hair and stroking your back as you shudder and tremble."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You have not spoken to Emet-Selch since that night; perhaps as an immortal, he is beyond such things like embarrassment, for he has treated you as normally as ever."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch makes no move, his full lips parting as you slant yours over his."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch merely watches, as he has ever done."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He is torn between hate and anger and burning, incorrigible jealousy as he watches the Warrior of Light kiss Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s plush lips work a trail down her arched neck, mouthing at her collarbones before sliding down to her breast."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And then Emet-Selch, as if remembering he was there, gives him a wry glance with those gilded eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Solus zos Galvus, the father of Garlemald, of Allag, Emet-Selch the Architect, kneels between the Exarch’s knees like a supplicant."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch forces him to answer by blowing cool wind over his swollen head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “C-Centuries,” G’raha sobs, head tipped to the heavens as Emet-Selch laughs at his confession."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Don’t tease him, Hades,” she chastises."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And then Emet-Selch’s mouth settles over G’raha’s cock and sucks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch was damnably, infuriatingly, deliciously good with his mouth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You’ve never fucked her, have you?” Emet-Selch challenges as G’raha finds himself lining himself against the Warrior’s cunt, spread wide for him, arousal glistening on her thighs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But her mouth was quite full of Emet-Selch’s cock."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Something in Emet-Selch’s eyes flashes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At first, Emet-Selch protested."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Warrior watches with interest, her eyes fever-bright as Emet-Selch trails shivery kisses up her damp thighs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It is unbearably tight; Emet-Selch clenches around him, the muscles of his nether entrance clenching around him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch tosses his head up to make a retort, but the Warrior angles her heel into his back and has him back down again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s hips move in time with the Exarch’s, arching into his hand even as he struggles to take his cock."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch, much to your dismay, treats you gently."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If it is his desire to merely please and not to take pleasure, that was something you could grow to accept, but you had the sinking feeling that despite seeing his body naked, you had never truly seen Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The dusty dunes of Amh Araeng cling to your hair, the Light growing monstrous within  your breast; you take Emet-Selch to bed without another word, biting a bloody crescent into his pale neck, shivering with a gruesome satisfaction at the alkaline taste on your tongue."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But you figured Emet-Selch could handle it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You can’t decide if you want to fuck me or kill me,” Emet-Selch announces, crossing his arms."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch stands, brushing off his robes, heedless to the splatter of crimson against his neck."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Or as fond as someone like Emet-Selch could ever be of anyone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You are silent for a long time—and perhaps Emet-Selch understands, because for once, he does not seek to fill the silence between the two of you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And for the first time, Emet-Selch has nothing to say."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You complete, utter, beautiful fool,” he mutters, and with an echoing snap, Emet-Selch absconds with the Warrior of Light."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch shrugs off his coat, taking off his gloves with his teeth finger-by-finger—gods help you, your insides clenched deliciously as you watched—before casting them aside and stripping down to merely his smalls."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “As you know, Emet-Selch is my title—Solus is the name this body wears,” he intones, coming to stand before you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “—is Hades.” “Hades,” you whisper into the darkness, “let me see you.” Hades stretches out a massive talon, moving with aching tenderness to cradle your chin up to his gaze."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You at least had the gratification that your fragile Sundered form made the great Hades lust."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A hundred thousand deafening voices rocket through you—every thought, every dream, every want, every desire, every whisper of Hades— Hades says something—it is not a word you can understand, it escapes your comprehension, but you know it means you in the most certain sense."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The colors blur, shatter, coalesce; you see Hades before you—as he was—the eyes are still the same, golden but there is a brightness to them, his hair the color of the stars themselves— You cannot feign impudence here, not in this blending of the minds—it is not so much a mingling as it is a taking, utterly enfolded in the gaping maw that is Hades, a mere echo of a spark within the cosmos."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your lashes flutter open in the darkness and you meet the familiar wry gaze of Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Y’shtola is the first to suggest it—while Emet-Selch had been unable to forestall his own Calamity, a thousand years of knowledge would be a valuable resource indeed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In those days, the Crystal Exarch treated Emet-Selch with little more kindness than a particularly poisonous snake; always disappointed to find him, constantly trying to usher him out of the Tower, and listening to all of his honeyed words with complete disbelief."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Perhaps the Exarch was not as wise as he’d thought himself, because there came a point—a certain shift in the tides—when he found himself looking forward to Emet-Selch’s visits."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Emet-Selch guessed (some) of his plans right from the start—anyone who knew of the other Shards could no doubt surmise that the Exarch was, indeed, not supposed to be here at all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch found the Crystal Exarch in a moment of vulnerability—hunched in his study with a bottle of wine over a tome recalling the stories of the Warrior of Light."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Such trysts did not happen often; Emet-Selch’s visits became less and less regular, and sometimes he did not have pleasure on his mind at all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Y’shtola arrives at a theory: if the enchantments of Amaurot still held, some piece of Emet-Selch must still be alive somewhere."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It comes to light that there is a shade of Emet-Selch within Azem’s stone—the self-same shade who saved you when all seemed lost in your contest against Elidibus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Luckily for Emet-Selch, Solus zos Galvus had left a dozen such useful bodies in Garlemald."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You,” Emet-Selch snarls."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “’Tis good to see you too, Emet-Selch,” G’raha says wryly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch bares his teeth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But, almost as if out of a morbid curiosity, Emet-Selch relents, sitting cross-legged on the floor, looking almost contemplative in his black robes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades does not look up from his desk when you entreat upon him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Do not expect me to make time for you,” Hades mutters under his breath."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I am merely fulfilling the duties of the Convocation, dear Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It is difficult indeed to tell the detempering worked or not, for Emet-Selch’s rage has not subsided."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I would be lying, if I said you meant nothing to me, Emet-Selch.” Hades takes the opportunity to wind his chain around your neck, slamming you into the brick wall, blood blossoming on your tongue."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’ eyes glow like burnished gold in the penumbral gloom."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And perhaps half, after eons of aching loneliness, is enough of a concession for Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Beneath the waves, there is a certain timelessness Emet-Selch finds himself unwittingly infatuated with."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sometimes disappointment is all Emet-Selch can feel these days."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He did not earn the name Hades for nothing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That was his reasons for building the foundation; but as Emet-Selch sketched and sculpted and crafted and finessed, he found himself unwittingly mesmerized by the ongoings of the sea creatures beneath the surface."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Mitron and Loghrif had failed in their duties, and so it was left to Emet-Selch to clean up the messes of his inferiors yet again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It is not that Emet-Selch is entirely immune to his own condition; it was more as if he was the helpless captain on the shores as his ship collided into the malestrom, helmless and without anchor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He did not ask the other Ascians if they dreamed, but Hades did."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You do not give them enough credit, Hades, she would say."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And perhaps fate had been cruel indeed, to leave Azem to wander while Emet-Selch was one of handful of witnesses to see their world burn to naught but embers and broken foundations."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Emet-Selch is bitter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch loves inviting himself places, regardless of whether or not it is a good time for company."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The interior of the Crystal Tower was as bright as Emet-Selch always remembered it, a cooler and less harsh light than the one without that bathed the world in perpetual sunlight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Curiously, the Exarch visibly jumped at the sound of Emet-Selch's footsteps, and he whipped himself around to face his uninvited guest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What...\" Emet-Selch paused, pointedly leaning over and narrowing his eyes at the crystalline viewing screen behind the Exarch as the latter attempted, vainly, to position his body between it and the Ascian."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Without waiting for the response, Emet-Selch closed the gap between them, brusquely pushing the Exarch aside with little resistance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Slowly, Emet-Selch turned to the Exarch, surprise and incredulity melting into delight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Please don't tell anyone, he said with a pleading note to his voice, sending a little frisson of delight through Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" said Emet-Selch in an unconvincing tone of mock-horror."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Exarch stiffened, inhaling sharply as Emet-Selch snaked one arm around his torso, holding him in place with an impossibly strong grip."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Exarch released a little whimper as Emet-Selch found what he sought and plunged his hands into the robe, taking that rigid length -- yet yielding flesh, that was one mystery solved -- into his hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Experimentally, gently, he squeezed, and the Exarch's hands flew up -- not, to Emet-Selch's surprise, to pry that invasive hand away, but to grasp onto the one encircling his shoulders in a bruising grip."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Exarch's hips rolled backwards as Emet-Selch pressed forward to meet the gesture, his own hardness grinding into the Exarch's lower back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They are-- he gasped, stuttering as Emet-Selch began, with agonizing slowness, to stroke him, pausing intermittently to gently squeeze and knead his balls."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch vocalized a quiet, noncommittal hmm, pale eyes shifting to the display where that hero lay splayed in their passion."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But,\" Emet-Selch's voice dropped abruptly to a snarl, his grip on the Exarch becoming so tight that he cried out softly and bucked against the hand that held him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then, just as abruptly as Emet-Selch had begun, he stopped."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Exarch panted softly, groaning his frustration through clenched teeth as Emet-Selch released him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Behind him, he heard the rustle of fabric, and he turned to see Emet-Selch adjusting his own robes to free his cock, just as hard as the Exarch's."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Wordlessly, the Exarch sank to his knees, seizing Emet-Selch by the hips and pulling him in as he took the Ascian's cock into his mouth, muffling his own whimper against his rigid flesh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Through unspoken agreement, Emet-Selch did not touch the hood still concealing the Exarch's face, but instead cradled the back of his head through it, guiding the Exarch into a pleasing rhythm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gradually, he met that rhythm with his own thrusting, and noted there was an unusual lack of give to his throat -- the crystal, it must be, he thought -- but the Exarch was so damned accommodating for that, swallowing his cock without hesitation or struggle as Emet-Selch climbed closer and closer to the edge of release, eyes darting between the twin displays of sheer eroticism before him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Beneath him, the Exarch took hold of his own length with one hand, stroking himself unsteadily, and Emet-Selch briefly entertained the idea of forbidding him -- but no, he was so close now, and doubted the Exarch could be coaxed into doing anything truly entertaining by such a forbiddance, and his thoughts were becoming less clear now anyway, the Exarch was now kneading his balls, and -- with a strangled cry, Emet-Selch's grip became crushingly strong as he ground himself into the Exarch's mouth, grunting through gritted teeth as he came, and it was not the Exarch he watched as he did."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The both of them breathless, Emet-Selch turned the Exarch around on his haunches, facing the display."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ah, said Emet-Selch, sounding uncharacteristically caught off-guard."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Crystal Exarch grudgingly admitted that Emet-Selch was not lying when when he said he was familiar with the Crystal Tower, though he had not anticipated what form that knowledge took."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" From some cramped room in the upper floors, Emet-Selch had conjured an ancient, dusty sofa -- a cabriole, he insisted -- and positioned it in front of the scrying pane."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch would take off his coats for a change and make himself comfortable, and though the Exarch never deigned to so much as unhood himself, he felt both challenged and encouraged enough to provide tea and modest snacks in the manner of a polite host."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How the vaunted Warrior of Light-cum-Darkness found the time for such a hobby was beyond Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Those wicks, remarked Emet-Selch idly, still watching the glass, \"are too short.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch heard the Exarch sigh next to him, the slow and deliberate sound of a man that realized he was being provoked into an argument and, to hell with it, was going to take the bait anyway."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your hospitality is not what I am principally fond of, said Emet-Selch primly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The host is adequate, interjected Emet-Selch, \"though hardly the most entertaining thing worth beholding at the moment.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch pointedly ignored this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Exarch hesitated, and for a moment it looked as though he might refuse on some principle or another -- but no, he rose and left, slipping past that locked door into his personal chambers (and how Emet-Selch would love to see what he hid in there) and returning after a moment with one of the candles in hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He sat and held it out to Emet-Selch, who took it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His vision shifted, and Emet-Selch could see a pale blue flicker of aether -- the shadow of its creator -- clinging to the wax, and he pursed his lips in distaste."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As the Exarch opened his mouth to object, Emet-Selch snapped his fingers and the wick sparked and crackled into flame."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The light was reflected in Emet-Selch's eyes as he watched, turning that wintery gold into something closer to the molten hue of newly-minted coins."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With gentleness that immediately set the Exarch on edge, Emet-Selch took the wrist of his crystalline arm and stretched it out before him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Some pressure, a little heat--\" he hissed as Emet-Selch poured the wax onto his wrist, where it pooled and the heat built up and yes, there was the pain, a mere phantom of what it should be but present nonetheless."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's eyes never left the Exarch's face, though his own remained fixed in an expression of polite, detached amusement, concealing the acerbic stab of want that flooded his veins."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a hard shove, Emet-Selch had the Exarch on his back on their little lounge and, balancing the candle expertly in one hand, moved to straddle the hips of the smaller man."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch moued slightly, raised the candle, and yanked the collar of the robe down roughly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He hissed through his teeth, back arched; Emet-Selch ground against his hips experimentally, the motion reciprocated even as the man's eyes kept drifting, damn him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch watched those lips part, the realization creeping over him that despite their couplings, he had never actually kissed the man."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's breath caught, and for the first time in a very long time indeed he was rendered temporarily speechless."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch smiled like a knife and lifted his shoulder in an affected little shrug."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gritting his teeth, the Exarch abruptly plucked the candle from Emet-Selch's fingers and shoved him to the side, sending him rolling off the lounge and landing on his back on the hard floor with a soft grunt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Setting the candle delicately aside, the Exarch leaned over him, forcing his legs apart as he yanked up Emet-Selch's robes until they were bunched up artlessly around his waist."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Twelve, what a ridiculous outfit, he muttered distractedly, and Emet-Selch raised an eyebrow thoughtfully in response but said nothing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's bare cock twitched in the cooler air of the chamber, and the Exarch took a small bottle from next to the lounge -- a gift from Emet-Selch, because they were enemies, he'd said, not savages -- and poured the glistening contents onto the tips of his crystalline fingers, spreading it until they were coated."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch lifted his hips from the floor as, without preamble, the Exarch glided his fingers from the base of his cock, past and under until he reached the tight ring between Emet-Selch's legs and pressed until it gave way to him, and he gasped audibly from the cold of the oil and the crystal."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Exarch settled into a slow and controlled rhythm, the crystal not taking any of the warmth from Emet-Selch's body in the slightest, remaining cool and unyielding."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Emet-Selch attempted to remove his gloves, to touch himself and relieve that exquisitely building ache, the Exarch delivered a sharp, painful smack to the inside of his wrist."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch jerked his hand back and did not try again, though his fingers twitched."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch groaned, tilted his head back, and growled through clenched teeth, \"Fuck me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They rocked desperate and urgent against one another, the Exarch taking Emet-Selch's length in his hand and stroking him roughly, his grip almost painfully tight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's breathing grew more ragged, his muscles tensing as he felt himself edging closer to his release."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Emet-Selch opened his eyes, he saw the Exarch now held the still-lit candle over the bare skin of his stomach."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With exaggerated care, he tilted it, and Emet-Selch watched the wax slowly bead on its edge and drip down the side, his skin tingling in anticipation before the wax ever struck him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Always he remained fixed on that scrying glass and the unknowing figure in it, up to the very moment he snapped his hips hard and fast, emptying himself into Emet-Selch with a bitten-back cry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Scions gathered the next day in the Tower, Emet-Selch only half listening as they discussed lightwardens and strategy and all the little personal tragedies he wasn't particularly interested in, the Crystal Exarch delicately steering them to their next tasks and even more delicately parrying suspicious personal questions."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Exarch froze, rigid, as Emet-Selch watched in unblinking silence."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Their steps slowed briefly, and Emet-Selch noticed the Warrior staring at his hand for the span of a heartbeat, expression unreadable, before they continued on their way."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was only after the door had shut behind them that Emet-Selch glanced down and noticed the smear of wax, bright and red as blood, along the hem of his glove."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sickeningly adorable a couple as Mitron and Loghrif were, Emet-Selch still regretted being right about his appraisal of them as too clever by half, and all the more their responsibility falling to him after their deaths."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" True, the Warrior lacked the context to use what they now knew to any particularly deleterious end, but their uncertainty was a variable that was not under Emet-Selch's control and that awareness wormed its way into him like a thorn, thickening his blood with that poison called hope."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's focus shifted until he could see that the man's aether, even considering the mutilated state its grafting to the Tower had left it in, was withered and drawn-in around itself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch sank down next to him, close enough for their shoulders to touch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch affected a noncommittal shrug."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Exarch canted his head to look up at Emet-Selch, the set of his mouth pensive within the shadows of his hood, an uncertain tension in the slant of his shoulders."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch merely watched him in uncannily polite silence; finally, the Exarch turned away and thumped his head back against the boulder, closing his eyes with a tired sigh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch hastily veiled himself from sight upon sensing a familiar soul approaching, positively relished the look on the Exarch's face when he opened them to find the Warrior standing over him instead."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Exarch was not of the First; whatever else, however else, he was a man of the Source and of that particular bloodline Emet-Selch had quite thought extinct."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It had become obvious to Emet-Selch between his control over the Tower, the way in which aether and flesh alike had been grafted to it, and his distinct turns of phrase."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch cannot fathom the utility of this polite fiction, and veiled within his shadows, Emet-Selch was bored by it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch obliged in a blossom of dark aether."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch idly observed the play of exhaustion limned with anger in his damaged aether."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Exarch was upon him with uncanny speed, and the heavy crystal of his forearm pressed against Emet-Selch's throat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Exarch pressed harder in response, and after a moment the edges of Emet-Selch's vision began to grow dark and hazy as a pleasant little frisson rippled through his flesh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The forearm was lifted only for that strong hand to take Emet-Selch by the shoulders and press him against face of the large rock."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Exarch rose to his knees, fumbling with the front of his robes and withdrawing his half-hard cock with one hand as the other tangled itself in Emet-Selch's hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch did not wait to be bid; he bent forward and took his cock into his mouth, hands stroking the Exarch's thighs through his robe."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's muffled moan in response hung defiantly between them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He felt the Exarch's fingers tighten on the fistful of his hair, dragging him down until he was hilted and holding him there, Emet-Selch drinking in the musky-sour scent of him and feeling his face grow hotter and his vision wavering again as he held his breath, wondering if the Exarch ever intended to let him breathe again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Abruptly, the Exarch released him, and Emet-Selch reeled backwards gasping in momentary reprieve before the Exarch guided his mouth back down to his cock."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Exarch did not show restraint now, fucking his mouth until Emet-Selch began gagging in earnest more than once, the wet choking noises barely muffled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's back arched and hands clutched at the Exarch's robes as his lungs burned for air."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's hair was mussed and tangled, the cosmetics around his half-lidded eyes smeared and running as dark trails of tears stained his reddened cheeks, and saliva glistened on his lips and chin as well as both their robes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gently, the Exarch cupped Emet-Selch's cheek with a warm hand and ran the pad of his thumb over his lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" asked Emet-Selch, more hoarse croak than usual drawl."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Goodbye, Emet-Selch.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch watched the Exarch go and wondered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch watched the Warrior of Light's soul breaking and his hope died stillborn in his breast."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No warm trickle of his life fleeing him, no tearing of flesh nor sharp scrape of bone on bone (he was both sure that bullet had shattered a rib on impact, and equally sure that Emet-Selch was a good enough shot to hit precisely where he meant to) and no more darkening of his vision as blood filled his lung and robbed him of his senses."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He would not risk feeding whatever fell thing Emet-Selch had conjured with the Tower's strength."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With his other options exhausted, that left waiting to see what Emet-Selch meant to do next."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's heels clicked as he walked across the marble floor, palms up in an unconvincingly conciliatory gesture."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" whispered G'raha, not meeting Emet-Selch's eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch merely stared down at him a moment before sighing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I had thought you better than grand gestures of martyrdom, frankly, said Emet-Selch airily, \"but I clearly failed to account for your inclinations to the dramatic and self-destructive.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch affected a slight shrug, but G'raha pressed on, saying, \"You may well be a monster but I know you feel affection for them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I do, Emet-Selch admitted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I told them, said Emet-Selch quietly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And I am telling you this now, continued Emet-Selch as though G'raha had said nothing, \"so you know that you have nothing to run to."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His ear twitched as Emet-Selch ran a finger along its edge, dragging his awareness back to the present."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There is no reason to sulk so, Emet-Selch purred."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Go away, Emet-Selch, said G'raha."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch was flirting with him, going through the motions of their usual -- gods, how he loathed the both of them right now -- foreplay."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" asked Emet-Selch mildly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" G'raha's mouth snapped shut as the reality of Emet-Selch's words washed over him, cold as seawater."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You're right, said Emet-Selch, his voice dropping to a low whisper."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hands strong enough to shatter bone cradled G'raha's face, holding him immobile as Emet-Selch bent down to press his lips to G'raha's."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" G'raha released a muffled, disgusted cry, keeping his lips pressed together until Emet-Selch caught his lower lip with his teeth and bit down hard."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" G'raha's gasp of pain was involuntary, but it was enough -- Emet-Selch's tongue slid past the bound man's lips, hot and invasive and insistent."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the grip of his fury and indignity, G'raha bit down as well, tasted blood on his teeth as Emet-Selch inhaled sharply and, to G'raha's chagrin, pressed upon him ever more hungrily."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After what felt like an eternity, Emet-Selch released him and straightened from where he had bent over, a smear of blood clinging to his lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Uncertainty or dissatisfaction -- G'raha could not tell which -- darkened Emet-Selch's expression, and they both breathed hard as Emet-Selch set his mouth into a thin line."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Affecting a languid air, Emet-Selch ran his hands over G'raha's chest before working to unhook the clasps and closures of his robes, breaking or tearing what would not open easily as piece by piece he disrobed him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" G'raha squirmed and tried vainly to pull away, but the crystalline restraints held him as fast as ever and Emet-Selch seemed content to indulge him in his impotent struggling as he exposed more and more of G'raha's flesh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With perfunctory gestures, Emet-Selch then set to disrobing himself in turn, walking in a slow little circle as he plucked every flashy accessory and over-elaborate piece of finery from his own body, finally tossing his gloves onto G'raha's chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A halo of broken jewelry and crumpled clothing around them, Emet-Selch studied G'raha laid bare before him, face unreadable as he took in the fusion of flesh and crystal on the planes of his torso."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" G'raha's skin prickled as Emet-Selch traced that boundary, feeling the heat of his fingers, feeling his heartbeat quicken and praying silently that Emet-Selch could not tell even as the corner of the man's mouth twitched upward."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch bent low, close enough that G'raha could feel his breath, and whispered, \"I don't believe you.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a firm grip Emet-Selch took G'raha's length into his hands and began to work him to hardness with deft and skillful gestures."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" G'raha tilted his head back, staring at the ceiling as he hardened in Emet-Selch's grasp."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He felt a cold pressure constrict tightly around the base of his cock and suddenly Emet-Selch was astride him, the crystal restraints easily supporting the weight of the both of them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch leaned forward, bracing himself with one hand as the other groped behind him to line up G'raha's slick, hard length, G'raha muttering a plea of please, don't that turned into a low groan as that tight, familiar heat enclosed him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch sucked in a quiet hiss through his teeth as he settled into place, a faint flush darkening his features as he watched G'raha sob raggedly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Seizing him roughly by the jaw, Emet-Selch bent down and dragged his tongue up the other tearstained cheek, leaving a red smear from his bloody tongue in its wake as his breath caught and he began to slowly rock his hips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Invectives poured out of G'raha in a furious stream -- murderer, rapist, monster -- before Emet-Selch picked up one of his gloves and shoved it roughly into G'raha's mouth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch stroked the length of his own cock as he chased his pleasure, and he came quickly, teeth clenched, thrusting into his fist, painting G'raha's stomach and chest with his release."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ask nicely, sneered Emet-Selch, lightly running a finger along G'raha's abused length \"and I'll finish you off as well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch turned away and snapped his fingers again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Bending to pick up his clothing, Emet-Selch redressed himself with shaking hands."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You are a fine one to lecture me about making people into sacrifices, whispered Emet-Selch harshly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You know nothing, said Emet-Selch, avoiding meeting G'raha's gaze."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And so what, snarled Emet-Selch, spinning to face G'raha."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There was a wound there, ragged and raw for all the eons Emet-Selch had borne it, and G'raha, torn between the kindness in his personality and the instincts of a predator, chose cruelty."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Silence, hissed Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I know you, Emet-Selch.\r\n\tBlood gleamed on the knuckles of Emet-Selch's hand as they glowered at one another, each boiling for reasons both different and more similar than either would care to admit.\r\n\tFinally, Emet-Selch shrugged, stepped back, and waved his hand dismissively; at once, the substance restraining G'raha sublimated into shadowy vapor, and he landed hard on the marble floor.\r\n\tsaid Emet-Selch sharply with a sweeping gesture, a creeping heat washing over the room as the light shifted from pale sterility to a malign, flickering orange.\r\n\tUnder the mute gaze of Emet-Selch, G'raha dressed himself with limbs heavy and stiff from confinement and grief.\r\n\tFinally clothed, G'raha affected his straightest posture and stared back at Emet-Selch.\r\n\tEmet-Selch stepped towards G'raha, lips pressed into a thin line.\r\n\tG'raha stood resolute, refusing to give Emet-Selch the satisfaction of his fear even as the man brought his bloodstained gloved hand up to cradle the back of G'raha's neck, thumb pressed lightly against his jugular.\r\n\tHe jerked away from Emet-Selch instinctively and at that moment, a loud and foreboding crack heralded part of the wall and ceiling collapsing, showering him in a cloud of dust and cloying smoke.\r\n\tHe shielded his face and shouted in surprise, and when he dared open his eyes again Emet-Selch was gone.\r\n\tThe end,\" murmured the voice of Emet-Selch, soft and low, next to his ear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He did not know where he was precisely nor where he was going or how he might find the Warrior and escape the purgatory Emet-Selch had sent him to, but he kept moving because anything was better than that room and that man."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Whatever other sins I might bear, I was honest with them, continued Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There was a pause, and then: \"Let me show you,\" said Emet-Selch in a voice that had razors in it, \"what I think of your affection.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He crumpled, stunned, and blinked dazedly; the light from distant fires was so dim he could only make out a silhouette that he recognized as Emet-Selch's -- until it wasn't, until glistening, fleshy tendrils had wound around G'raha's limbs, unyielding in their strength."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Found you, said Emet-Selch, and his voice was a timbre and pitch that took more tongues and vocal chords than that mortal body possessed, and G'raha realized with a wild, hysterical thrill of terror how wrong he had been to treat the Ascian like a man, how foolish he was to have believed Emet-Selch's submission was anything but a condescension."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Whatever the thing that was Emet-Selch had now that passed for a cock seemed to curl within him, and despite himself G'raha felt a jolt of pleasure through the haze of pain that made his own cock twitch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch hummed in satisfaction, purring in tones that felt like a wool comb being raked over his soul, \"Wail and gnash your teeth as much as you wish, but we both know how much pleasure you've been begging me to wring out of your malformed flesh.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch did not withdraw, did not pump into him but stayed hilted to the hip, that appendage writhing to apply a rhythmic and precise pressure instead."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He was shamefully, agonizingly hard, awareness drawn irresistibly to the caress and ripples of Emet-Selch's flesh moving against his and how good it felt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He did not understand how he could enjoy it, loathed the flicker of disappointment when Emet-Selch slowed or shifted to remove touch from here, squeeze there, pulled ever more deeply from the well of pleasure he seemed intent on drawing dry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He ached with such an intensity it was like he had been struck, and the ache grew ever more terrible as Emet-Selch applied a thousand little gestures intended to tease and draw G'raha to the precipice without ever allowing him to tip over it, an irresistible pressure building within him with no release promised or permitted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" G'raha did not know how long Emet-Selch held him against that edge."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Every time he seemed to drift away, every time he attempted to curl up inside himself and block out what was happening, Emet-Selch would apply some new torment: another radiating spiderweb of cracks in the crystal of his arm or torso, a hard and bloody bite with teeth too long and too sharp to be human at the nape of his neck, a bloody gash made with gilded claws dangerously close to his eye."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch made plain his desire for what G'raha had always denied him and G'raha was sure he would go mad from it, from red agony shading to black need, from the unrelenting and insistent pressure built up within him, from the tingling denial traced into his oversensitive skin; he was sure that this was Emet-Selch's design, the way he would finally break him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" G'raha mouthed a handful of syllables around Emet-Selch's claws, muffled and incomprehensible."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch withdrew his fingers and in nightmare tones projected a vivid imperative: \"Say it.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch did not wait for him to finish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hands slid up G'raha's back, and as Emet-Selch bent himself to his unraveling he grasped the back of the collar and yanked it tight against his throat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In moments, G'raha came in thick, copious torrents with an unthinkable intensity, sure for a moment Emet-Selch had plucked out his eyes now, so radiant was the pleasure of release."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sheathed in mortal flesh, Emet-Selch slouched onward, dragging ragged and barely-conscious G'raha by his collar behind him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A galaxy of tiny motes of light heralded the end of Emet-Selch, and G'raha watched and felt hollow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I am Emet-Selch.” He is quite familiar with Emet-Selch, whose end came once before alongside that of Gaius Baelsar, taken down together in the early days of the 8th Umbral Era."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch makes a most curious noise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “But an interesting one, no?” Emet-Selch shrugs, props one hand on his hip."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is no small foe, and even if he knows every move the Ascian will make— Emet-Selch is a man of easy smiles and quick boredom, whose presence the Exarch grows used to in much the same way one does an ill-fitting seam."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He grows almost fond of Emet-Selch’s gloating, whenever he gains a little more ground, unearths one more secret about the mysterious Crystal Exarch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch walks the growing streets of the Crystarium in fascination, learning every tidbit and morsel he can about the elusive Keeper of the Tower— The first time Emet-Selch kisses him, it is with one hand buried in the collar of his robe, fingers knotted in the wool, the cool substance of his mask pressing into the tip of his nose."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The kiss is open-mouthed, Emet-Selch bending to reach him and the Exarch, momentarily surprised, gasps into it— Emet-Selch bites down on his lower lip hard enough to draw blood."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch licks it away, tongue pressing to the roof of the Exarch’s mouth, and then he pulls back, as abruptly as he had kissed him in the first place."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Almost daintily, Emet-Selch wipes the blood from his lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It feels swollen and raw to the touch, and he looks up at Emet-Selch, who is watching him with a curious expression upon his face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch leans over him, says, “I am asking.” Visible only to the Exarch, the Ascian half-smiles, reaches up and slides his mask to the level of his eyebrows."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With Emet-Selch’s mask lifted, the Exarch takes hold of the base of his own hood to keep it over his face, and lifts his chin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch pulls him closer once more by the collar of his robe, leans over him to correct for the disparity in their heights, kisses him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It is a kiss, and Emet-Selch leads him in it, directing him by the collar of his robe, dragging his teeth over the Exarch’s lower lip, his breath catching in his lungs when he opens his mouth into the coaxing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch bites at his lip again (gently, this time, and then harder when a noise the Exarch does not mean to make claws out against the back of his teeth, drawing blood he once more licks away), presses his tongue into the Exarch’s mouth, and he can feel the other man’s stubble, growing atop the curve of his chin, the softness of his lips, smell the scent of him— He makes another noise, ragged and wet, curls his fingers into Emet-Selch’s chest, nails digging into the heavy cloth of his robe, and pulls him closer, pants into that open mouth in ways he did not know he either needed nor could ask for."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Beneath the cologne he wears as part of his mortal guise, Emet-Selch smells like leather and dust."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It never lingers: it comes and goes with its bearer, as quick as he arrives and disappears, often all of the warning the Exarch sometimes has before Emet-Selch appears."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Exarch looks up to say something, but before he can even speak, Emet-Selch has straddled his lap, taken the Exarch’s face in his hands, and kissed him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch opens his mouth and the first brush of his tongue is like lightning, surging and sparking through his tongue to his teeth to his eyes, to his hair, to his mind down through his whole body to the soles of his feet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Exarch makes a noise he does not intend to, a begging sound, broken and high and ragged, all his skin suddenly too tight for his body, the crystal growing up his right arm thrumming as if a plucked string, claws at Emet-Selch’s hipbones through his robe, bucking up into that inexorable weight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He moans, unbroken and needy, crying out into Emet-Selch’s mouth, and the Ascian presses one hand to his chest to shove him back in his chair, his back thudding against the wood and his entire body drawn upward towards the kiss as if by a string."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s hood is falling, revealing the streak of grey in his hair, the dark purple at his part."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is licking the roof of his mouth and there’s more of that low, bone-shaking buzz rattling his thoughts into mist in the confines of his skull."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There’s a taste in his mouth that’s honey but sweeter, brighter, more green and white than gold, leaving his tongue and lips and throat feeling numb and full and swollen and wanting as he swallows the kiss that Emet-Selch gives him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When he begs “Please,” it’s not even asking for anything but more of whatever this is, the saturated aether that he’s breathing, that Emet-Selch is biting into his aching lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I brought you a surprise,” Emet-Selch whispers, teeth scraping over the Exarch’s lower lip when he speaks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He follows the teeth, biting back at Emet-Selch’s open mouth in an imitation, still pinned back against the chair and desperate for that touch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That Emet-Selch crossed the Rift to give him this, not speaking to hold it in his mouth, is half of what spurs the Exarch to fist the front of his robe and jerk Emet-Selch back down, their teeth banging together unceremoniously, breaking the Exarch’s lip."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Emet-Selch kisses him, hands cupping his cheeks, he never tries to push down the Exarch’s hood."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In his mouth, Emet-Selch’s aether is— He is his own hardness, the pressure of Emet-Selch atop his lap, the touch on his face, his agonized scraped-raw fingers tugging vainly on the Ascian’s coat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The noise he tries to make tangles in the back of his throat and dies out into Emet-Selch’s lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His muscles are trembling and his blood burns and he can breathe aether, taste aether, see aether, the tangible sensation of it and Emet-Selch atop his lap, brighter than the First's light-washed sky with how much of it he has, so bright to his vision the Exarch cannot call it anything less than looking into the sun."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But when Emet-Selch presses a thumb below his lip, atop the curve of his chin, pulls the Exarch’s mouth further open so that he can bite the tip of his tongue, draw blood and air both from his mouth, stealing his lungs empty—  “Not that I care what you partial souls do to keep yourself ‘functioning,’ but something tells me the part of you that is still mortal is waning on the edge of collapse,” Emet continued."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It took too much energy, concentration to hold the image of the party, so far from the tower, and Emet’s appearance was helping none."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though, it appeared today Emet was being more stubborn."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If I didn’t know better, I would say you didn’t like me,” Emet hummed, following him as he left the Occular, heading for the stairs out into the Crystarium proper."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The tap of his own sandals was mirrored by that of the leather boots Emet so fondly wore."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet’s suggestion of sleep did come with truths, he had been pushing himself hard, harder still due to the ever-growing threat of Eulmore and Vauthry’s rage."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Only then, hand on the door of the tower, did the Exarch look behind him to confirm Emet had truly left."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He knew it was a fleeting thing, not something that was truly there given the growing concerns with the Warrior and the meddling of one Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was high time he checked in with the Warrior of Light and also to check on Emet’s meddling."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “....Emet-Selch....” the Exarch sighed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Whatever would I have told your precious Warrior of Light?” Emet began as he walked toward the table."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Now, now,” Emet said, rising suddenly and with speed the Exarch hadn’t expected."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No sooner had the Exarch stood up did he feel Emet’s hands on his shoulders, pushing him back down to sit on the bed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet held him firmly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Exarch winced at the loud snap of fingers next to his ear, and soon found himself eye to eye with Emet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet had so graciously magicked the chair mere ilms from them to under his backside, which he so elegantly now slouched in."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If I was not on your side, I would have left you on that landing, drooling like a buffoon,” Emet tutted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So, Emet had been the one to bring him back to the tower?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet finally took his hands away from the Exarch’s shoulders to hold his heart in mock pain."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You wound me with your words,” Emet hissed in fake pain."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Come now, you are more to me than entertainment,” Emet said with a wave of his hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The comment seemed to shock Emet just as much as it did the Exarch, and the Exarch found himself at a momentary loss for words as Emet seemed to backpedal."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What with the Crystal Tower and your rift walking abilities and-” Emet said quickly but the Exarch had noticed...something?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But maybe, had Emet showed him... “-and after all, you make it easier to track our lovely warrior with all your spying,” Emet finished."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I am spying.” Emet started to say something, finger up to continue the argument when he realized the Exarch had agreed with him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “There is no fun in you agreeing with me,” Emet pouted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You have soured the mood,” Emet hissed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet gave no answer, merely glowered at him before turning on his heels and walking out the door."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At the very least, he realized, he possibly now possessed a way to make Emet leave him be."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Flipping the tome open, he paused and looked up at the door where Emet had left."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet continues to bother the Exarch, yet no one is surprised."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet, however, finds something lost."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Exarch’s head snapped up and he turned, looking at Emet-Selch, who was until a moment ago, slouched against one of the supports of the Ocular, talking about Twelve knows what."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet shrugged, appearing to ponder if he should start over on whatever he was talking about."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And here I thought you were interested in Allag and all I had to offer,” Emet taunted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He had a feeling Emet had been hoping to catch a glimpse of the Warrior through the glass."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet snorted, a wave of his hand as though proud of this fact."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And yet you are so interested in Allag, of all things,” Emet taunted back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It seemed the Ascian was curious to know where he was off to, the padding of leather soft as he heard Emet walk after him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Clearly Emet was not ready to finish their conversation as he was."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Running away so soon, Exarch?” Emet tried."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet huffed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not that the Exarch wanted Emet around as he slept."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Still, he was surprised when Emet did not leave."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He found himself hesitating on removing his cowl when he felt Emet’s presence near."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I did not expect you to be a voyeur,” the Exarch said, finally turning to look at Emet, whom had taken to looming near his door."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I was just curious if you slept in those curtains you call clothing,” Emet said with a flip of his hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He heard Emet mumble something, his ear turning toward the noise, but he did not pick it up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His mind craved rest and he was not going to delay it anymore because Emet-Selch decided to once again meddle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “The crystal has taken less of you then I thought,” Emet said and the Exarch looked over his shoulder."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He was surprised to see Emet was considerably closer to him now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Are you concerned, Emet-Selch?” Emet barked a laugh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I merely would hate to have an object of my fascination turn to stone before I can get what I want out of it.” Emet stared at the Exarch expectantly, hoping for banter or a rise or something."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He sat down on his bed and looked at Emet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades!” Hades?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades.....Hythlodaeus....” he said to the shadows."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The name Hades still sat on his tongue, the name Hythlodaeus ringing in his mind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Who was Hades?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The name, Hades, wanted to leap off his tongue."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch remained motionless in the dim of the room, watching for far too long as the Exarch slept."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades!” When the Exarch had cried out that name, Emet almost leapt from the shadows, almost dropped to his knees at the Exarch’s side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades.....   Hythlodaeus   ....”   The Exarch had said to no one, yet the words, the names burned into Emet’s heart."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet waited, watching for another long moment before he soundlessly walked to the side of the bed and sat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet raised his hand and reached out, wanting to touch the fine hairs of the Exarch’s head, his ears."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Wordlessly, Emet rose and departed from the room, calling forth a portal."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch looked at him, starting to say something before he cut him off."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Now, hearing Emet speak as though everything they have ever done was the will of a primal, it bore too much upon him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Finally, Emet spoke again, eyes boring into the Exarch’s frame."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Just....what are you to speak so freely about all of you broken souls?” Emet demanded."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You, who hide behind glamours and shadows while I stand with my heart laid bear!” The Exarch started to speak but Thancred stepped in front of him, between him and Emet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet stepped back, hands raised in mock surrender."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her gaze locked on Emet’s."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet said nothing before vanishing in a pool of inky aether."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch was perched on the chair across his study, silently reading."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet, before his words could form, Emet was continuing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Why are you here, Emet-Selch?” The Exarch finally said, though he made no move to push the Ascian away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Instead, the Exarch found himself staring at the details of Emet’s coat, the leather worn from years of use."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet seemed unphased by such a reaction, though he did move faster than the crystalline guardian, yanking the staff away from him and out of reach."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After all, despite the times I have watched you, you still are alive, are you not?” Emet stated, though he stepped away to keep his staff out of reach."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet genuinely looked concerned."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “-I care about you,” Emet finished."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Let me say my piece,” Emet said, holding his staff out to him as though he was offering a gift."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch sat across from him, a pot of tea between them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Exarch looked into his cup as Emet drank his."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Of course, I have no way to explain to you what you are seeing,” Emet stated, “but you will have to trust me in assuring you that what you have seen is not the future.” “Yes,” Emet said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades and Hythlodaeus...they are...were....people,” the Exarch stated."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I...have theories,” Emet said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet set his cup down."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I want to be sure,” Emet told truthfully."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I would have it no other way,” Emet said, standing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lest their feeble brains break,” Emet muttered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I will ponder if such is safe to do,” the Exarch said, though he found himself letting Emet guide him toward his bed chambers, let him help him get ready."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This time, Emet turned away as he changed into his sleep garb."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Pray...I test something, Exarch?” Emet asked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I will not harm you, yet,” Emet promised."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If I deem it so, I hope you are prepared to fight the Scions for your damage.” Emet rose his hands in surrender."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Close your eyes,” Emet demanded."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Exarch rose a brow before Emet huffed and added “-please.” He thought he heard Emet kneel down to his height, his ears following the sound and his tail twitching with slight concern."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As though Emet was incredibly close to him, his hand but a breath away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet was standing to the side, hand to his mouth, eyes closed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Emet-Selch-” “But...it...you.” Emet shook his head and started for the door."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Just sleep,” Emet replied with a wave of his hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet was beside him, lifting him gently back into bed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Just sleep...and wake to a better future.” The world faded into a warm, empty void as Emet’s hands left him upon his bed, drawing away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet's spell lasts longer than he meant and the Exarch dreams of a new (old?)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Of course I would find you, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The figure, Hades, scoffed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades chuckled, wrapping Hyth’s hand in his."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I was beginning to miss you,” Hades told quietly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “That is not what you said this morning when I burned the coffee.” Hades snorted and shook his head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Don’t ruin the moment,” Hades scolded."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet’s spell had been stronger than either man had realized."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “While it seems like an unwise thing to do, we can always try and call Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch hadn’t been expected to be called by the Warrior of Light for aid, let alone for aid specifically relating to the Exarch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Such harsh accusations right after I came so quickly to your call,” Emet retorted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet was concerned for the health of the Exarch, but he would not reveal such to these sundered beings."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet rose a brow and looked around."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did he get turned into an animal, a cat perhaps?” Urianger flinched, which made Emet smile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “By the twelve you talk too much,” Thancred groaned, “he just was put to sleep.” Emet paused mid sentence and looked at the gunbreaker skeptically."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Asleep, you say?” Emet said, pondering."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Was not plucking you from the lifestream enough?” Emet countered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet knew exactly where he was, still curled up in his bed, tucked in, safe, dreaming."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Well, if you don’t tell me, I can either start looking, myself, or you can bring him out here to me if you do not wish me poking around in the tower that I clearly helped build at one point,” Emet gloated."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You heard about the grapes,” Hades mumbled sleepily, the warmth of the sun despite the inky sky dancing over and through their robes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades snorted and shifted, slowly pulling himself away from the other."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You are quite busy as the venerable Emet-Selch,” Hythlodaeus said with a smile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He chuckled as Hades regarded him skeptically."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Because you are an idiot, it seems,” Hades said, gently bopping Hythlodaeus on the forehead before he stood."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “One of the best, save for that one called Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh stop it,” Hades said with a laugh, offering his hand to the other."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus stood and briefly took off his mask, pressing his forehead to Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades held him tightly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet looked at the sleeping form, chest rising and falling slowly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though he acted aloof and uncaring, Emet did cast a spell to make sure it was only sleep afflicting the Exarch and not some strong poison."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “My, my, you were not fooling me,” Emet-Selch said with a snort as he approached the sleeping form of the Exarch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet wondered who had put the Exarch back in his outfit and why it was so important to keep himself hidden, but it was a thought for another day."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Still, Emet wished he could play with the fine hair of the Exarch’s ears in this moment, tucked away under that hood."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet waved his hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If you wish not to giveth-” Urianger started but Emet-Selch just snapped his fingers and the Exarch immediately shifted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet could see beneath the hood that the Exarch was blinking away sleep and stepped back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Unable to break such a simple spell,” Emet taunted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Why is everyone…” he started, before his eyes fell upon Emet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “What have you done now?” Emet laughed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch remembers old friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of Hades and Hythlodaeus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I don’t see your name on this bench,” Emet-Selch challenged, though from his tone, he was clearly testing the Exarch, almost as though he was waiting for whatever came next."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He saw the movement of Emet’s hand, reaching toward his own before the realization hit him and he pulled back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet opened his mouth to speak but then closed it looking away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They were alone here, yet Emet felt the weight of a thousand lifetimes, a thousand souls peering into his very heart."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades.”  Emet flinched, jerking back as he looked at the Exarch with an expression the mage could only describe as a mixture of pure sadness, despair, joy, and surprise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You….your name is Hades,” he said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet gazed deeply at the mage, trying not to lurch forward, to pull the other into his arms, to hold him until the end of the universe, never let go, never again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Your name is Hades,” the Exarch said again, again a statement, yet this time Emet realized the Exarch expected an answer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My name, my name is Hades,” Emet-Selch spoke, and the Exarch realized there was no lie in his words."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It is also Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet nodded, not quite sure what memories the Exarch was seeing outside of what he had gleaned, what other memories the Exarch was seeing besides the fall of his world, but he knew enough to agree."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet, Emet realized, this man, this Exarch should not be able to see such things, not at the level his soul was."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You recognize my soul, do you not?” Hades said suddenly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Why am I entertaining this nonsense.” The Exarch started to walk away before Emet grabbed his arm, spun him around to face him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We are not done talking,” Emet-Selch said, his voice no more than a whisper, but sinister, desperate at the same time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The break spell hit him before he could finish his statement, throwing Hades back over the bench."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades held his hands up in surrender."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades pulled himself to his feet, deciding it was time to fade away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As the guards came into view, Hades retreated, down to the darkness of the ocean."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the last moments before the teleportation spell completed, Emet could have sworn that he saw doubt on the Exarch’s face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet was certain, the Exarch remembered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet….Hades had grabbed his arm and instead of staying calm, he cast break and sent him away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Remember me, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades sat upon the bed in the recreation of the dwelling he once shared with Hythlodaeus, in the shade that was created to be Amaurot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades remembered how often that door had been just left open, Azem and Hythlodaeus, and even himself on occasion, throwing ideas and concepts through the door to each other for examination when they couldn’t be bothered to walk the distance to show off what had been made."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He remembered the confusion when Azem was asked “who are you bonded to, Hades or Hythlodaeus?” only for Azem to reply with an enthusiastic “yes!” Or when Hythlodaeus was asked “do you live with Hades or Azem?” and Hythlodaeus would laugh and say “neither, they live their own lives and I live mine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hythlodaeus and Hades were bonded, but they willingly allowed Azem into their little family."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades looked up from where he sat, up to the larger than life mural on the wall across from him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For Hades, Hythlodaeus had painted a long legged bird with a stern face appearing to be watching Azem climb and judge their abilities (Grumpy bird, Hyth had called it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet would later call it a shoebill)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For Hades, Azem drew the many masks and marks of incantation that Hades knew, representing his great casting ability and mastery of the arcane, as well as many buildings and other models of architecture that Hades worked on at the Bureau before taking his new role in the Convocation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, for the life of him, could not remember why Azem had settled on such an image for Hyth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades felt tears drip down his face as he looked upon the mask in his hands, cracked and caked with ash, worn with age."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For Azem and Hythlodaeus both, Hades had just drawn grapes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch had not appeared, not muddled since they spoke in the orchard."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So he poured his energies into plans for the final battle, focused his mind on anything but the emotions he had felt in the brief moment before Emet had absconded through his ashy portal."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Cheers.---I ship Hyth\/Hades hard."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I also ship the disaster thruple of Hyth\/Hades\/Azem."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet makes one also."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet found himself lingering toward the outskirts of the group more and more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet told himself not to grow attached to these pointless, sundered beings, but the Exarch…."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet needed one more sign."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For the first time since the Final Days, Emet felt himself wavering."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet had resigned himself to his choice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It took Emet too long to realize that was what the Exarch wanted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We have to keep running, Hades!” Hythlodaeus was holding him against the side of a building, the screams of the dying all around him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had narrowly pulled his beloved out from the rubble before another building fell, but now he was wondering if it was worth it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades!”   Hades looked up at his love, holding him tightly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “No!” Hades jumped at the force in Hythlodaeus’ voice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades pulled the mage closer to him, choking a sob through the dust and ash."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He held Hades’ cheek a moment before taking his hand tightly in his."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades had seen a strange look in Hythlodaeus’s eye as he looked up at the sky, after the ground stopped shaking."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He felt rooted, tied to his spot as Hythlodaeus pulled himself away from him, told him he was going to look for survivors, for supplies to help Hades heal."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Hades could only remember his eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was too late that Hades realized."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That Hades saw the ward go up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Please!” Hades screamed, clawing at the door, trying to break the ward, trying to break the spell that he knew was keeping him from dying to the war outside."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet broke then."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet stood rooted, arm outstretched, Zodiark willing him to fire, to kill."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet Emet could not."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet refused."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet made his choice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This one hurts more probably because I got to indulge more heavily in my headcanon and how Hades and Hyth lost each other."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet holds tight to his prize."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch mused this as he held his prize tightly to his chest, cradled the Exarch in his arms as he walked through the façade of Amarout."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet had something he had long lost."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet looked up at the inky sky, thousands of malms under the sea."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ghost lights, Emet mused as he walked, holding the Exarch tighter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hythlodaeus over-indulge again, Emet-Selch?” asked a shade, one that had been modeled after one of Hyth’s coworkers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet made some sort of reply, which the shade laughed at."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet nodded robotically as the shade departed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Like clockwork, each shade joked about Hythlodaeus’s health, or how Emet had to take care of his wayward lover."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" None noticed that neither Emet nor the Exarch stood well below their height, looked so different."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet walked them to the recreation of their apartment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He took the elevator, holding the Exarch just so, so that the wound, and the blood, was covered by the Exarch’s red silk and Emet’s inky black coat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If they did, they made no comment as Emet walked passed the shades of his neighbors into the apartment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" However, it wouldn’t kill him, not if Emet treated it quickly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Zodiark was complimenting him, saying how clever it was that he was restoring two sundered, that Emet never should have been doubted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Azem had been a miscalculation now in his favor, Emet realized, and it masked his selfish response to save Hythlodaeus in the eyes of his god."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet wrapped the wound tightly and lay his beloved on fresh linen, donning him in simple sleepwear as he draped the Allagan finery over a chair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet looked at the glass vial in his hand and closed his eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet turned and looked back at the Exarch, returning to the bed in quick strides."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I am never letting you out of my sight again….never letting you cross through doors I cannot follow you through,” Emet whispered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And after a thousand, thousand lifetimes, Hades truly cried."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And yes, Emet is only going to get more protective of his precocious Hythlod-Exarch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is watching you impatiently, waiting for your response; focusing on you and you alone as if the angry, alarmed voices of the Scions were merely annoying mosquitoes buzzing about."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch snaps his fingers and the voices cease as a translucent barrier springs up before you, locking your friends away behind it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You can’t think of anything that Emet-Selch, Elidibus, and the others might do with you that is worse than the deaths of your friends at your own hand, but right now you admittedly can’t think of much at all besides the pain of containing the boiling Light, so you’re willing to allow that there could well be something you’re overlooking."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Looking up at Emet-Selch, you have no choice but to acquiesce to his bargain."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch moves to stand beside you, holding out a hand in invitation, and with a last deep breath you reach out and take it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You try to tug your hand from his, knowing all at once what will happen should he appear to be vulnerable, but contrary to his vessel's soft appearance and lean build, Emet-Selch possess an unnatural strength far exceeding your own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch lets out a curse and pulls his fingers from yours."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You steadfastly refuse to turn your head and look at your friends, knowing that Emet-Selch is right to be wary."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His blind hatred of Lahabrea leads him to such fury against the Ascians that he would take joy in murdering Emet-Selch even if it meant he must go through you to do so."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As promised, it does not take Emet-Selch long to return."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He takes in the scene at a single glance; you, still bursting with aetheric Light, the Scions trapped behind the barrier and fighting to break through, and Emet-Selch with your hand clasped in both of his, the agony on his face evident as your Light flows into him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades, no,” the Emissary says immediately, and you’re confused for an instant before you realize he’s addressing Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Let me do this.”  As he speaks Elidibus takes your other hand, letting his ornamented glove with its deadly claws melt into shadows and vanish, and the two Ascians glare at each other in a brief battle of wills before finally Emet-Selch concedes the point and lets go."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is beside him instantly, supporting him with his hands on Elidibus’s shoulders, murmuring soft words of encouragement."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" More time passes, with Elidibus continuing to pour his cold aether into you and take the corrupted Light in return, while Emet-Selch hovers near him protectively, clearly worrying and unconcerned with hiding the emotion."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s expression tightens, his lips pressed together in a thin line."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus scowls, but he knows a lost cause when he sees one and so contents himself with watching, concern evident in his features even behind the crimson mask, as Emet-Selch takes a deep breath before clasping your hand once more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Finally, you force yourself to turn around and look to Emet-Selch’s barrier at your friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Will you now keep to your half of our bargain?” Emet-Selch asks quietly, and you glance over at him, startled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The two Ascians exchange a glance, and then Emet-Selch sighs heavily."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It had been a close thing, so very close; Y’shtola was nearly lost to you… but for the intervention of Emet-Selch, who asked nothing in return for the gift of your friend’s life."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch waves his hand lazily at the translucent shimmer that separates you from the Scions on the other side, and it flashes for an instant before settling."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch bites off a curse and vanishes, reappearing instantly by your side just in time to catch your fall, and a moment later Elidibus takes your other arm to help steady you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thancred turns on his heel and walks away, still furious, and you know you’ll never make him understand why you couldn’t let him enact his plan, waiting until Emet-Selch had crippled himself to save your life and then entrapping the Ascian’s soul in auracite."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I don't know when I'll be able to see you again,” you tell the Scions, and you feel Emet-Selch startle slightly at your back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch offered to let me retract the bargain I made,” you say, and watch your friends’ eyes widen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I can bring you as often as you wish,” says Emet-Selch, and you glance over to see him smiling at you, a soft, sweet smile that you’ve never seen before."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch heaves an obviously affected sigh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch leans over and kisses you softly, and you find yourself smiling against his lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I will join you soon,” Emet-Selch says."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You may ask me to stop whenever you wish, or simply say no, and it is the same of Emet-Selch, and of…” Elidibus hesitates for a moment, “of all of us,” he finishes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Perhaps it is simply that he and Emet-Selch are the only living Ascians you know, and other names would not be familiar to you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Before you can press your lips against his, you feel the tingling of the aetheric sense granted you by the Echo and a mere instant later the space beside you is wreathed in black and violet as a portal opens, depositing Emet-Selch into the room."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Although he has said nothing of the sort, the too-cheerful tone of his voice spurs you to realize that Emet-Selch must be wondering if there is room for him in this cozy tableau."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Indeed we are, and your presence will only heighten it,” Elidibus says, standing and crossing the room to tug Emet-Selch into his embrace."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch clears his throat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He yanks Emet-Selch closer and pulls his head down to kiss him hard, biting at his lower lip, demanding entrance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The taller Ascian acquiesces easily, bending to accommodate the difference in their heights and opening his mouth to let Elidibus plunder his warmth, and their tongues battle sweetly as Elidibus slides his hands down Emet-Selch’s back to squeeze his arse, pulling their hips together and grinding against him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You watch wide-eyed and not a little aroused, and finally Emet-Selch breaks their desperate kiss to let out a soft moan, his breath coming in little pants, although you know by the black Ascian robes he now wears that he has no mortal host to inhabit, and no need for air."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch glances over at you, taking in your huge eyes, your pupils dark and dilated, and your breathing faster than it had been a moment ago, and his smile turns wicked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “She’s untouched, Hades,” Elidibus says quietly, a slight tone of reproach in his voice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That must be Emet-Selch’s true name, you realize."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch looks startled for a moment, then he smiles at you, expression now holding a sincere warmth that echoes the sweet smile you liked so much in Amaurot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As he kisses you, nipping your lower lip here and there and licking at your tongue, you feel Emet-Selch pulling off your boots one by one; he tosses them aside and moves on, unfastening and removing as much of your clothing and armor as he can reach."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Yes?” you say hesitantly, not entirely sure what you’re consenting to, but it becomes clear when Emet-Selch trails his gloved fingers from your ankle upwards to your thigh and the fabric covering your leg melts into shadow and disappears."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch bends to fasten his mouth onto your other breast, his teeth deliberately grazing your areola as he sucks at your peaked nipple, and the twin assault leaves you reeling; you let out a low moan, pleasure building in your core, making you feel tight and hot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s hands drift down to your inner thighs, pressing gently outwards until you realize what he wants and part your legs for him; he slips a finger under the band of your panties and tugs, sharp metal claw easily slicing through the flimsy fabric, then he pulls the torn garment off you entirely, leaving you fully nude."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As you shudder Elidibus cradles you securely against his chest with one arm around your waist, his other hand playing with your breasts; cupping, stroking, and squeezing, slowly driving you mad with desire, while Emet-Selch’s fingers teasingly circle your labia, ghosting across your aching slit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Please!” you cry in frustration, and Emet-Selch gives a low, wicked chuckle; the sound  tugs  at things deep in your core, and you can’t help the needy little whine that escapes your lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch slides a second finger inside you alongside the first, slowly pumping them in and out, stretching your slick inner walls as you writhe and pant and moan, losing yourself in the pleasure both your Ascians are giving you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “So deliciously tight and wet,” murmurs Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch pulls his hand from between your legs and brings it up to his mouth, tongue darting out to taste your wetness as he licks his fingers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It’s soon clear to you that Emet-Selch has had extensive practice at this and he chooses not to tease this time, instead licking and sucking at your sex as though he knows exactly what will drive you crazy, his skilled tongue delving inside your entrance and laving your inner walls while you pant out your pleasure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You feel yourself trembling, the deep ache of  need  ratcheting up higher and tighter as he licks at you, and only Elidibus’s tender yet firm hold pinning your arms to your sides keeps you from grabbing at Emet-Selch’s head to push him further down against your sex."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades!” you cry out, and you feel him shiver as he pauses in his task for a brief instant, his hands clenching on your thighs, and he makes a soft, almost desperate sound, a needy pleasure sound that causes you to nearly keen with delight to hear it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As you shudder helplessly against his chest, eyes closed and still whimpering in pleasure, Elidibus shifts himself from behind you and carefully lays you down onto the soft pillows, stretching out beside you on one side while Emet-Selch does the same on the other."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You reach out to return the caresses, but they’re both still clothed in the heavy, ornate Ascian robes, Emet-Selch in black and Elidibus in white, mirror images of each other."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In response, Emet-Selch raises up a hand and snaps his fingers, vanishing both sets of robes and leaving himself and Elidibus wearing only loose trousers of a soft, rich fabric."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is by far the taller of the two and his shoulders broader, in keeping with the Garlean appearance he has taken, but both men are lean and toned, with chiseled musculature."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A slow, wicked smile spreads across Emet-Selch’s face as he sees you looking at him, and he places both hands behind his head and arches his back, stretching, all too clearly aware of his own beauty."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “He makes the most exquisite sounds if one knows how to coax them out, and such delicate skin that shows every blush, and every mark I leave on it.”  Emet-Selch is blushing now, you notice, soft pink flush traveling all the way down to the top of his chest, and you can’t help reaching over to brush your fingers across his collarbone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then your heart skips a little at the reminder of what you intend to do, and you look over at Elidibus, suddenly unsure of why he would want you; compared to Emet-Selch you’re a fractured, broken creature with a drab countenance and a body marred by the scars of many battles."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You would be more comfortable with Hades, perhaps.” Mutely you shake your head; it’s Elidibus to whom you want to offer this gift of yourself, he who saved your life at risk to his own, and, you can finally admit to yourself, he who has flitted through your fantasies ever since your first meeting long ago, when he so courteously asked to test the depths of you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Is it so difficult for you to indulge yourself, love?” Emet-Selch asks him quietly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” he says."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch, who has been silently watching in rapt attention, reaches out to trail his fingertip along Elidibus’s spine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" An instant later you feel… a tingle, a soft brush against your aetheric sense that somehow tastes of Emet-Selch, though you can’t understand how you know that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The wild sound reignites your desire and need in an explosion of heat that spears directly into your center, and dimly you are aware that this is Emet-Selch’s arousal rather than yours but you don’t care, you don’t care about the pain of it, you can feel your body tightening as Elidibus fucks you deep and hard, using you for his pleasure in an incoherent haze of desperate need."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You have a single instant to understand that this too belongs to Emet-Selch before you feel Elidibus thrust himself deep into you one last time; his entire body shudders, and a hoarse noise is torn from his throat as his cock pulses inside you, cool aether spilling from him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus collapses on top of you, deep shuddering breaths causing his chest to rise and fall, and you watch as Emet-Selch combs his fingers gently through his lover’s hair,  affection joy you are everything to me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch slides over to rest his head on Elidibus’s shoulder, letting out a soft sigh, and his hand traces idle patterns on the Emissary’s chest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch seems to guess what you’re thinking, because he laughs quietly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch stands up with you cradled in his arms, and heads towards the bedroom’s door."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Where is this place, exactly?” you ask, as Emet-Selch carries you down a hallway that contains at least five different rooms, branching off into more corridors at each end with a colossal stairway leading down from the center."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch shifts your weight onto one arm and snaps his fingers with the other, a heavy golden coin appearing in his hand, which vanishes with a twist of his fingers just as quickly as it had appeared."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You look up at Emet-Selch, who is obviously enjoying your reaction."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch snaps his fingers and the tub begins filling itself, steam from the hot water billowing softly into the air."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You narrow your eyes at Emet-Selch, who is smiling all too innocently as he watches you wriggle in what is clearly still his grasp, though you’re unable to figure out how that is, as he’s not visibly touching you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Soon Emet-Selch has carefully lathered and cleansed every inch of your skin with caressing touches, and just as you’re wondering whether he will spread your thighs to wash away the lingering blood, and what else his hands might do while he’s there, you feel something soft and slick brush against your foot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Startled, you look up at Emet-Selch, who is watching you closely to monitor your reaction; his smile is mischievous, but there is hesitancy in his golden eyes, even a bit of anxiety, and you realize he is searching your expression for fear or disgust."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Clearly they belong to Emet-Selch, as much a part of him as any other, and just as clearly, his true nature must be nothing at all alike to the mortal shape he currently wears."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To your consternation Emet-Selch’s usual smirk returns at the same moment that a third tentacle brushes between your legs, the slippery length of it sliding against your sex beneath the water, and you’re not sure whether it’s relief or disappointment you feel when he does nothing else with the odd appendage."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You feel your ankles being tugged apart by the tentacles, spreading your legs to allow Emet-Selch to clean off what little blood remains between your thighs, and his fingers gently separate your delicate folds and crevices as he washes you, no longer using the sweet soap but simply letting the water rinse you clean."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch chuckles quietly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You see Emet-Selch smile when you lean your full weight back, relaxing against them -- against  him  -- and it doesn’t feel nearly as odd as you would have guessed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Puzzled, you tilt your head to the side and watch him intently, trying to figure this out, and it must be plain what you’re thinking because Emet-Selch moves up close to you as if presenting himself for inspection, managing to look both smug and entirely guileless at the same time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I hope so.”  Emet-Selch smiles warmly at you, and you feel a gentle tug at your shoulders from the tentacles behind you, encouraging you to lay back against him again, so you do."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your aching need only increases as Emet-Selch begins to lick at you delicately, tasting you at his leisure in no particular hurry, and you moan softly, wanting more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is looking entirely too pleased with himself, but you don’t have the energy even to muster up a scowl."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You sigh deeply as the soothing heat begins to soak into your abused body, relaxing bonelessly against Emet-Selch’s chest, his warm embrace the only thing keeping you from sliding limply down into the tub as if you were entirely liquid yourself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You lay there quietly with him for long minutes, content to allow this sore and aching mortal vessel of yours to soak out its pains in the wonderful caressing heat; not being currently possessed of one himself, you can’t help but wonder what Emet-Selch gets out of the activity besides an opportunity to hold you with your naked body pressed slick against his -- but he must know that he could do that anywhere."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Do stop thinking so loudly,” Emet-Selch murmurs into your ear, startling you out of your musings."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It occurs to you, finally, that with all of the pleasure he and Elidibus have given you tonight, Emet-Selch has taken none of his own, and you feel yourself flushing at how selfish you’ve been."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You  will  tell me if I’m hurting you,” Emet-Selch demands, in a tone so low it’s nearly a growl."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It feels good; you’re too tired and sore for intense arousal, but it’s still extremely pleasurable to be so completely filled and stretched nearly to your limit, to feel Emet-Selch moving in you, his hard shaft gliding against your inner walls."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You feel so good inside me, Hades, you’re not hurting me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You can feel your core trying to tighten with fresh desire, but you’re just too relaxed and too exhausted for it, and you’re enjoying how good this feels without being completely overwhelmed by your own need, making soft little pleasure noises that are nearly drowned out by the sounds of your wet bodies coming together, and the harsh, near-guttural growls from Emet-Selch as he lets go of more and more control."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You snuggle yourself against him, feeling pleased and so very content, happy to have been able to give Emet-Selch the same pleasures he has heaped upon you; you only wish Elidibus were here as well to share in the closeness and comfort of this moment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Not at all,” Emet-Selch says immediately, sounding surprised."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh, he very much wanted,” Emet-Selch tells you, with a wicked little chuckle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Indeed, it was the very strength of his desire to have you that bade him hesitate,” Emet-Selch continues."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s golden eyes glitter with mischief, and the smile he gives you is truly wicked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch insists on carrying you out of the bathing-room, wrapped in one of the soft, fluffy towels; you’re going to become quite spoiled if this keeps up, but you can’t bring yourself to protest much."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He glances up from his work as Emet-Selch comes in with your drowsy and half-asleep form cradled in his arms."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I do hope you two enjoyed your bath,” Elidbus says, his amused glance telling you that he’s well aware of exactly what went on in the bathing-room, and you have the grace to blush, though of course Emet-Selch only smirks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades will stay with you if you wish it; he does so love his sleep.” Fortunately, Emet-Selch is having none of this; he places a soft kiss on the top of your head, shushing you, then lays you down on the bed and glides across the room to pull Elidibus into his embrace."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He declined to join you and Emet-Selch in the baths because he thought you did not want him there, and you hadn’t questioned it because you were too busy worrying that  he  might wish to be well away from  you, that he might regret having lain with you at all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Clutching the towel tightly above your breasts, you slip from the bed and move to join Emet-Selch, wrapping your arms around the still-hesitating Emissary; Elidibus is caught between the two of you, and with his body pressed against yours, you  feel  as much as hear his soft sigh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Accepting the pleasure that is offered you has never been one of your strong points, love,” says Emet-Selch with a low chuckle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch herds you both up onto the enormous bed, humming softly to himself as he arranges the scene to his liking with Elidibus in the center between you, and then, without warning, he pounces; the Emissary gives a startled yelp as he feels the touch of cool aether snaking around his wrists, and abruptly his arms are tugged upwards over his head, clearly pinned there although you cannot see that the aetherial tether which binds him is attached to anything."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Scowling, Elidibus pulls at the restraints to no avail, and Emet-Selch smiles at him, looking both pleased and rather smug; he snaps his fingers and the loose shirt Elidibus is wearing vanishes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Tonight, you are mine.” Emet-Selch looks over at you then, tilting his head to the side, and smiles."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “No, love,” murmurs Emet-Selch quietly, “you misunderstand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This is about  your  pleasure.”  He bends down to press his lips against Elidibus’s for a gentle kiss that quickly becomes heated, the Emissary tugging at his restraints again in an attempt to get closer as their tongues battle and teeth nip and bite, until eventually Emet-Selch pulls himself away, panting softly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With both arms stretched over his head and pinned in place, the muscles of his chest and abdomen are clearly defined, pale skin slightly flushed after the kiss he had shared with Emet-Selch, and his loose hair makes a silver-white waterfall against the pillow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At the sound of a soft, amused chuckle you pull yourself away from Elidibus and look up, startled momentarily to realize that Emet-Selch is still here; you had very nearly forgotten about him in your eager, compelling desire to touch and pet and stroke the temporarily restrained Emissary while he still permits it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" While you were occupied with kissing and touching every inch of Elidibus’s upper body, Emet-Selch has clearly been busy entertaining himself below; he’s unlaced and removed the loose trousers that were the single article of clothing Elidibus had been wearing, leaving the Emissary as nude as he himself is… and as you are, you suddenly realize."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You can’t even remember when you’d shucked the towel you were wrapped in when Emet-Selch carried you into the bedroom."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Once more Emet-Selch clearly has an idea of what you’re thinking, and the hand with which he had been lazily petting Elidibus’s thigh he now slides over to take hold of his lover’s half-hard cock; his other hand he wraps around his own, and his smile is utterly wicked as he begins to stroke both himself and Elidibus in the same rhythm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The scene before you is debauched and absolutely pornographic as Emet-Selch makes a soft sound of enjoyment, Elidibus arching into his touch with a shuddering sigh, and you can’t imagine anything more erotic than Emet-Selch’s long fingers wrapped around his own shaft as he pleasures them both."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not allowing yourself to think about the boldness of what you’re about to do, you reach over and slip your hand just above Emet-Selch’s as he slides it down Elidibus’s cock, mimicking the smooth up-and-down movement, letting him show you what to do and how tightly to grasp."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The two of you work in tandem for a few moments, coaxing a low moan from Elidibus that makes you shiver delightfully to hear, before Emet-Selch pulls his hand away and leaves you to continue pleasuring the Emissary on your own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your hand glides down to the base of his shaft and you give a gentle squeeze, at the same time wrapping your lips around his head fully, and he moans, long and low, the heated sound cutting off into a muffled groan as Emet-Selch leans over and kisses him -- a hot open-mouthed kiss that delves into licking and biting and teeth, ending with Emet-Selch using his tongue to carefully clean off the blood leaking from his lover’s bleeding lip."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Just as you pull your mouth away for the second time, you find yourself captured in a sweet kiss by Emet-Selch, whose journey licking and biting his way down Elidibus’s body has finally brought him within reach of your mouth; it seems he has decided to taste you as well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s kiss is soft and almost delicate; a slow, lingering exploration of your mouth with his lips and tongue, fingers carding through your hair, and you find yourself melting against him with a little sigh of pleasure, your eyes closing against your will."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch snags a pillow before shifting down along the bed to kneel between Elidibus’s legs, pushing gently at his lover’s inner thighs to spread him a bit wider."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Lift up your hips for me, love?” he asks, and Elidibus obliges, allowing Emet-Selch to prop the pillow underneath, easing him into a comfortable position before dipping his head to take Elidibus’s still flushed and leaking cock into his mouth, deeper and deeper until he reaches the base, his pale throat rippling as he swallows around the shaft."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus  moans  helplessly, Emet-Selch’s strong hands on his hips keeping him from bucking upwards, and he makes a desperate sound of pure  need  and  want  that sends newly heated desire rushing through your blood."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You watch, now completely entranced, as Emet-Selch bobs up and down along Elidibus’s cock as he sucks; the Ascian has neither a gag reflex nor a need to breathe, letting his throat constrict around the swollen head with each swallow, intent on pleasuring rather than teasing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus is pulling at the bonds that restrain his wrists, little whines and gasps escaping his lips, his entire body nearly quivering with a deep need for release that has been building from the moment Emet-Selch bound him, the promise of pleasure intensifying with each and every touch, every kiss, lick, bite, suck, until it is nearly unbearable."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You scratch your nails down Elidibus’s chest and he moans again, shuddering, and then Emet-Selch carefully slips a hand between his lover’s thighs and with his hips propped and tilted upwards you can see the two fingers slide in, and Elidibus cries out as his pleasure detonates, a hoarse, incoherent sound of absolute ecstasy that you feel as much as hear, your body pressed so close to his that his shudders are also yours."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then you hear him draw in his breath suddenly and let it out in a low hiss of renewed pleasure, and you raise your head and look to see that Emet-Selch is not yet done with his lover; his slim fingers slowly thrust in and out of Elidibus’s entrance, scissoring open to gently stretch the way."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As you watch, eyes wide and cheeks heated with a flush at the sheer intimacy of the act, Emet-Selch pulls his fingers out completely and grasps his own hard cock, giving it a few quick strokes, and you can see something slick glistening as he moves his hand, though there is no apparent source for what is clearly lubrication of some sort."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Still kneeling, he eases closer and Elidibus spreads his legs to accommodate Emet-Selch’s hips, welcoming him with a soft exhalation of pleasure as he slowly pushes inside, easing in with gentle little thrusts until he’s buried to the hilt in his lover’s ass."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You are so beautiful,” murmurs Emet-Selch, and there is adoration in his voice as he gazes at Elidibus, perhaps even worship."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch leans forward to settle his mouth against Elidibus’s in a deep, hot kiss that echoes his movements, exploring thoroughly and slowly with his tongue."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You recall your ruminations earlier in the bath with Emet-Selch; only this morning you had led your companions to Amaurot, knowing everything, and still convinced that the answer lay in battle to the death with the Ascian who had saved your friend’s life."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You look again at Emet-Selch and Elidibus, enraptured in their lovemaking, twined together by passion and emotion as much as by intimate physical joining, their quiet sounds of pleasure and desire making your heart ache to be included."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus is once again fully hard, as Emet-Selch’s hand is wrapped around his cock and stroking him slowly in time with the rhythmic thrusts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You watch as Emet-Selch bends down to bring his mouth to his lover’s shaft, giving a quick kiss and teasing little lick to the swollen head, making Elidibus moan softly; you manage to catch his eye as he straightens up; as is becoming the norm, he seems to know what’s on your mind, and offers you a wicked smile and a beckoning gesture, asking that you move closer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You sit up from where you’ve been warmly snuggled against Elidibus and shift yourself down the bed a little, maneuvering yourself onto your knees in the process, and with some help from Emet-Selch behind you, you lift yourself up and straddle Elidibus across the hips, taking his flushed cock into your hand to guide him into your body as you settle yourself down."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Soon enough you find your rhythm, bending your knees and flexing to bounce yourself smoothly up and down, and Emet-Selch matches your movements with his own, still kneeling between Elidbus’s thighs, pushing his cock deep inside his lover’s ass with a hard thrust each time you glide down to take Elidibus’s shaft fully into yourself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You feel Emet-Selch’s hand on your waist, and an instant later you let out a soft moan and your back arches as he slips his fingers down to rub at your aching clit; you cannot see him behind you, but you  feel him smirking, you just know that he is."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The hot stretch of Elidibus’s cock completely filling you, the needy, passionate sounds that he makes filling the air, Emet-Selch’s clever fingers stroking at you in exactly the way you need; you cannot help it, the rising wave of sheer pleasure crashes over you, cascading as it overtakes all three of you like dominoes, one after the other."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your body explodes in ecstasy, your slick walls caught in helpless spasms clenching down around Elidibus’s cock; he groans hoarsely at the sheer deep pleasure of it and comes hard, once again filling your core with his cool aether, and Emet-Selch follows you both in his own release with a soft cry, slumping forwards to lean against you with his nose pressed into your hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Eventually, Emet-Selch remembers to release the aether that has held Elidibus bound for all this time; allowing the Emissary to bring his abused arms down at last, and he immediately reaches up to tug you down closer to him, giving you a sweetly chaste kiss."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch has also carefully pulled out of his lover’s body and by now arranged himself comfortably beside Elidibus, nuzzling at his throat to gently lick over the bite marks he’d left earlier."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Do not think I’ve forgotten about the white auracite which you so conveniently did not mention to me, Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You don’t know if it was the tone of Elidibus’s voice or something in his words, but Emet-Selch shivers visibly to hear it, his expression going heated, and Elidibus gives him a sharp, predatory smile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I look forward to it,” Emet-Selch says, his voice low and suggestive, and then he laughs softly when a loud yawn punctuates the silence -- yours."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch for his part has curled himself around Elidibus and tugged the soft blanket over all three of you, creating a warm nest with the Emissary in its center."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Memory comes back in a bleary rush; you’d fallen asleep beside Elidibus and Emet-Selch, after an extremely long and eventful night which you blush to recall."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades?” “Her soul, sundered as it is, looks entirely normal,” says Emet-Selch, leaving you to wonder why such a thing had evidently been in doubt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aside from Emet-Selch and Elidibus, you know the titles of only three others, and all of those have returned to the Lifestream; Igeyohrm and Nabriales by your own hand, and – “So we meet again,”  intones Emet-Selch mockingly, breaking the long silence that had descended upon the room."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Oh, yes,” says Emet-Selch immediately."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” Elidibus says, sounding aggrieved as he reaches up to rub at his temples, “please.” “Your soul was dimming, stagnating,” Emet-Selch says, and there is anger in his voice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Neither Hades nor myself was able to break the hold She had upon you,” he tells you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It is not,” Emet-Selch says dryly, “considered wise to venture into Hydaelyn’s own nest on that plane."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And as you ponder whether there might be a way to save Ryne from Her influence, another, even worse thought hits you:  Thancred was ready to go through you in his blind hatred of Emet-Selch, of Ascians."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You never truly believed that when you accepted Emet-Selch’s offer and his aid, it would mean losing the friends who have become your family."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hearing the tremor in your voice, Emet-Selch reaches across the bed and pulls you over into his lap, and you are not so distraught as to miss that he doesn’t use his arms to do it, but rather several of the velvety-soft deep violet tentacles you’d glimpsed in the bath."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “You do so enjoy asking the difficult questions,” Emet-Selch grumbles, but he doesn’t stop petting you, gently carding through the sleep-tangled lengths of your hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “In fact, there are,” says Emet-Selch from behind you, and you’re certain you can  hear  the smirk on his face, though your back is still pressed against his chest while he plays with your hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You’d thought to yourself more than once that Emet-Selch seems to be reading your mind, but you didn’t truly believe it in a literal sense."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It is merely that you are… so very alike to one we once knew, and Hades spent decades at her side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Someone who was evidently very close to Emet-Selch, someone  whose soul he must have instantly recognized the moment you set foot on the First."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I feel an obligation to point out that my great-grandson is  not  a maniac,” says Emet-Selch dryly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You didn’t need to confuse me.”  You glance over your shoulder to shoot a glare at Emet-Selch, who smiles innocently, giving a lock of your hair a playful tug."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lahabrea’s golden gaze immediately moves to Elidibus, and a slight shifting of Emet-Selch’s posture tells you that he, too, has turned his attention to the Emissary."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I do not have Emet-Selch’s vision, and he hasn’t my expertise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch raises an eyebrow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You almost burst out laughing at the idea that Emet-Selch has any modesty whatsoever."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then it occurs to you that he isn’t referring to the shadowless form Ascians take when they do not wish to have a mortal vessel, but rather to their true forms, the ones Emet-Selch told you that you’re not yet ready to see."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There were still problems to be solved, favors to be done, naturally, but you found yourself musing more often than not of your final fight against Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You collected your aether with a deep breath, and whisked yourself away to Amaurot, full glad that Hades had the good graces to give its reflection an aetheryte plaza."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The eerie silence raised the fine hairs on the back of your neck, yet you were determined to find whoever invited you to Amaurot; especially now that Emet-Selch was no more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For the second time in what was definitely not a long enough amount of time, you found yourself wondering if you were perhaps willingly throwing yourself into the maws of a hungry beast; a plan orchestrated by Emet-Selch or Elidibus should either one fall to the Warrior of Light."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You created a habit of visiting Amaurot: assuming you had the time to do so, you would teleport there in the evening, explore a bit, try to talk to shades you had not yet heard from, and finally slept in what you assumed was Hades’ old residence, or a faithful copy of it, at least."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Resting in Hades' bed was akin to floating, so soft were the silk covers and fluffy duvet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was odd to see Hades like this: no discernable wound in his middle, where you had pierced him with coalesced light."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, for his part, was stock still, as if moving even a centimeter would dispel this shared illusion of peacefulness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Clutching at the crisp white duvet, you searched Hades’ face for a hint of anything, but his expression was one of neutrality, as if he was waiting for your reaction before he unveiled his own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Still set upon the bed, you startled a moment and considered your options: you were far too groggy to properly fight Hades’ monstrous form off; if you chose to run or return via a spell he would most certainly catch you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades currently seemed placid, and you wished to speak with the Ascian again, unconventional as the sentiment was."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Facing directly in front of Hades, you placed your own hands atop his, a hesitant, questioning motion, and flinched at their iciness."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades….”  You chuckled, though it was a pathetic one, tinted with your tears, and you wrapped your arms around Hades’ midsection in a tight embrace."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was as if Hades’ fears were all at once annulled: he grasped you tighter, and carded his hands carefully through your hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After a moment you made to step back again, but Hades simply pressed you closer to him, cradling your head against his clawed hand and pressing his forehead against yours."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You were beaming, now, confused as you were, but you could not stop the warmth that circulated through you; the joy and relief at finding that you did not kill Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You were priming a series of questions to ask Hades: how did he manage to survive, where was he all this time, why did he stay hidden for so long...but his rather unexpected statement stopped you mid-thought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The expression on your face must have been one of pure bewilderment, as Hades sighed, slouching forward."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was perched next to you now, and you watched as he stared at his hands, palms up on his lap."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Even in the lifestream, I….” Hades shook his head, as if to clear his thoughts, and began again: “If you’ve not yet come across the Emissary, this may come as a surprise to you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades, you are no longer…” you trailed off, biting your lip."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You tried to discern Hades’ expression, but he was in profile, refusing to meet your eyes yet again, stark white hair curtaining a portion of his face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’ voice was barely a whisper."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was obvious Hades was suffering, and though you did not understand the niceties of his situation, you were unwilling to leave him to carry his burdens alone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” you began, but before any further words could leave your lips, he shook his head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’ expression was unusually somber, and so you let him continue, though you were determined to broach the subject at a later time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So deep in thought were you that you momentarily forgot about Hades’ presence."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades raised an eyebrow, so you clarified, “I can’t return to the Crystarium while Elidibus is searching for me; that would place too many bystanders in harm’s way."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades’ frigid hand brushed against your cheek, and you startled as he turned your gaze to meet his own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your cheeks began to heat up as you realized Hades had not yet removed his hand from your face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “So, hero, all you must do now is teleport to the Crystarium, explain your situation to the Exarch and the rest of your motley crew, and return to Amaurot again, where you will stay until Elidibus is no more,” Hades drawled, as if he was giving the most basic of instructions, but you shook your head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades, while I do appreciate what you’ve told me, and while I do wish to converse with you once again, you know my role as Warrior of Light is one I cannot simply put aside for even the tiniest amount of time.” Accepting Hades’ offer of protection  did  seem like the best route to take….but you couldn’t simply disappear, even with good reason."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As you began to suggest your proposal, Hades’ gloved hand suddenly covered your mouth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades inhaled sharply."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Naturally, you decided to follow Hades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though he would absolutely be upset with your disobeying his order to stay put, it didn't feel right to let Hades fight what seemed to be a troublesome enemy alone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You followed whom you believed to be Hades around the corner, into what appeared to be a small park."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You were so busy admiring the colorful array of trees and flowers that you almost bumped into his back, but y ou stilled immediately and stumbled back as the figure you thought to be Hades turned around."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Everything seemed blurry at first: a canvas of red and brown and gold, but your eyes adjusted relatively quickly, and you made out the distinct features of Hades’ own room."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades must have saved you somehow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades would have some choice words for you, that, at least, you were sure of."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You blinked owlishly a couple of times until Hades raised a brow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades huffed as he passed you a flute of water on the little nightstand by his bed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Thank you, Hades.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Assuming there is a next time, you pointed out, the crumpled duvet atop you suddenly more interesting than Hades’ glare."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Have you considered that your acts of heroics are maybe a tad selfish?” Hades asked, expression inscrutable."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You swayed a bit, cursed under your breath, and Hades rushed towards you, placing his hands on your shoulders."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Enough of that,” Hades muttered as he gently pushed you back down."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You were furious, but some of that raw anger subsided as your eyes met Hades’."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a sigh, Hades sat next to you, staring out the glass window into the endless blue of Amaurot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades clasped his hands together, and opened his mouth to say something, but decided against it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In merely a second Elidibus had easily overpowered you, and had Hades not already been searching for him, you doubt you would be alive."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You recalled how Hades so easily disabled the rest of the scions during your final battle with him; how even then, you wondered if this was finally where you would fall."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades was next to you, back against the headboard and arms crossed, but you were surprised to see him asleep, instead of scowling at you accusingly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades' chest rose and fell in a slow tempo, and he appeared much younger, so visibly relaxed and momentarily free from his burdens."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You stayed put, mind traversing several different subjects at once, but Hades woke less than a bell after you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades face lit up immediately, and you attempted to smother the butterflies fluttering about in your stomach at his unusually pure expression."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I’ve no doubt Elidibus has already returned to his scheming,” Hades said."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even I would have difficulty believing an enemy returned from the dead, allegiances switched,” Hades said, planting his feet on the ground and standing up, “I’ll leave it up to you to decide what you would like to tell them, but you absolutely will not mention me in any way, shape, or form.” Hades ran a hand through his sleep mussed hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You stood up, closed your eyes, and made to teleport back to the Crystarium, but before you could gather your aether, Hades quickly snatched your wrist."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades rolled his eyes and scanned you up and down, plainly unimpressed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades slipped your hair over one shoulder and hummed as his fingers touched your throat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “My apologies,” Hades murmured as he pressed on one of the darker bruises."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades took a deep breath and gathered what seemed to be a bundle of aether as red as Ifrit's flames."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades tutted, but he removed his hands and allowed the rotating aether and symbols to fade away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch's return was not something he had foretold, but it mattered not."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet chuckles this time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet's fingers continue to toy with the pert flesh upon your chest, and then he pulls away, resuming his circling around the pair of you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet chuckles this time, the sound circling around you as he continues to move."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They both interrupt you by clicking their tongues, and you practically feel Emet-Selch's frame press up against your chest as his lips settle beside your other ear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This time Emet clicks his tongue, hands stilling upon his breasts, and you swallow, hard, as you realise your mistake."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And M-Master Emet-Selch, you tack on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lahabrea's fingers dip away to settle over your lips, and Emet shifts, his ungloved fingers replacing those which touched you moments earlier."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Clean me off, pet, he purrs against your ear, and as you open your mouth to obey, Emet's cool fingers slip within you, grinding against that front wall and tearing moan after wanton moan from your lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And then Emet's fingers leave."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet's fingers take your chin, forcing your gaze to meet his before turning it to the side so you can take in Lahabrea's."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Our dear little pet, Emet-Selch purrs out, and Lahabrea chuckles."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You can feel his breath in one ear as Emet-Selch's coolness presses up against your front."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Be sure to give thanks to your Masters, they whisper in your ears, and you feel them both, simultaneously, pressing their cocks to your entrances, Lahabrea's heat against your rear and Emet's coolness against your front.. \"Needy, needy needy,\" he and Emet chide."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Silence falls upon the room, and then Emet snaps."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Well, given her fondness of us... Emet purrs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet gives the leash a tug."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch watches her work, watches as roses and carnations wend their way into her creation, sprouting from the earth at her knees and getting snapped up by her fingers right as they bloom."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch goes first, and he stops on the threshold of the library for a split second, just taking in an image he knows not if he will ever see like this again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Let us take care of you tonight,” Emet-Selch says, weighing the heavy words on his tongue."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “There is no need.” Elidibus is blushing, but still leaning into Emet-Selch’s hand, his lips catching on the knuckles of his fingers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch’s hands move in from behind, parting the robes he wears, his hands following the warm planes of his chest down until the clothing falls away, pooling on the floor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch could spend all night tracing the veins of Elidibus’ body and still not feel satisfied in having memorized him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus hooks his hand behind Emet-Selch’s neck, eyes hazy with raw need as he brings their lips together."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Azem’s eyes meet Emet-Selch’s briefly as she sheds her robe, and this always leaves him breathless: to see her naked, to know that she trusts him enough to be revealed and vulnerable."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She raises her chin, that defiant streak that flares up whenever she exposes herself, and Emet-Selch replicates her act as she makes Elidibus turn to her with the back of her hand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “How poetic,” Emet-Selch drawls, chin coming to rest on Elidibus’ shoulder."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Azem joins in on kissing him, taking turns with Emet-Selch to leave Elidibus breathless until he fumbles backwards to lean against the grand piano, his body trembling and a hard-on jutting out against their hips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Too long, Emet-Selch surmises, hearing the cry above him as Elidibus jerks sharply forward between their mouths."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She licks up what she can reach with her tongue, but Emet-Selch pulls her up to her feet next to Elidibus, taking his time to lick her clean."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch takes a step back to watch, his hand on his own cock."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Taste all of her,” Emet-Selch says gently."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She whimpers, a noise that never fails to make Emet-Selch feel the clench of heat within himself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Just that little touch alone has her crying out, and she beckons to Emet-Selch, twisting to the side to be able to moan her pleasure into his mouth as he kisses her, their breaths hot and wet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her thighs flex and tense, squeezing hard on Elidibus’ head as she comes, her moans turning into soft sobs in Emet-Selch’s mouth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch knows the feeling well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I think she is more than ready for you.” Emet-Selch pumps two fingers into her, a second gush of wetness coming out with them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As Elidibus rises to stand, Emet-Selch keeps fingering her until he is coated with her slick, bringing his hand to Elidibus’ dick to prepare him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Does she feel good around you?” Emet-Selch asks, voice dropping low and husky."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Just move, please, just fuck me,” she whines, getting what she wants when Emet-Selch moves Elidibus’ hips for him, frozen in awe as he is."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch leans forward to kiss her, sloppy and greedy, moaning against her as her tongue moves into his mouth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Feels good, doesn’t it?” Emet-Selch purrs in Elidibus’ ear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Will you—“ Elidibus moans between his thrusts, caught between her hot heat and Emet-Selch’s probing finger."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Yes!” Elidibus’ voice trembles, and he tries to crane his head back to meet Emet-Selch’s lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His words warm Emet-Selch to his core."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her touch seems to ground him, and he relaxes enough so that Emet-Selch can bottom out fully."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The arrangement of their bodies must be strange to see, he muses — Azem sitting on the piano, legs spread wide to accommodate Elidibus between her thighs, and Emet-Selch pressing Elidibus further into her, guiding him, holding on to his neck and hips as he rolls his hips lazily."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch wants to be smug, wants to say something that will make her reach across the man between them and tug at his hair, bite his lips, but the words falter on his tongue when he sees just how blissful she is in the moment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The orgasm ripples through them like a chain reaction, their aether so finely attuned to each other that when Azem comes, her nerves light up Elidibus and Emet-Selch, who push each other over the edge."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch slips outside right as he comes, spattering his come all over Elidibus’ back and ass, and then slumps forward."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It will be a long night, Emet-Selch thinks to himself as Elidibus takes his cock into his mouth all the way to the root."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And I you,” he says back to her, a sparkle in his eyes that Emet-Selch has never seen before."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not one to be left out, Emet-Selch puts his hands on Elidibus’ thighs, lowering himself to kneel between the other man’s legs, gazing upon the hard cock resting on his lower belly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “When have I ever done that?” Emet-Selch says, quirking an eyebrow in mock offense at her accusation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She watches Emet-Selch through her eyelashes, blush high on her cheeks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Knowing that being too tender, too gentle right now, it would do Emet-Selch in worse."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And Emet-Selch has long run out of words that truly comfort her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “We are nothing if not fools in these matters,” Emet-Selch says, gently peeling her hands away, kissing her fingertips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The soft trickle of tears does not let up, and Emet-Selch joins Elidibus in kissing them away, but he has never been able to keep his hands to himself when she rests naked in front of him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch slides out fully, adding a second finger, and Azem writhes between them, her lips moving from Elidibus to Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Elidibus swipes his thumb over her clit, she gushes over their hands, sweet and sticky and wet, so damnably wet, and her walls clamp down on their fingers before relaxing again, and Elidibus slides two in alongside Emet-Selch’s two."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is the first to sit up on his knees, pulling her backwards onto his lap, spreading her legs wide apart."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch sees what he sees through his eyes, the shift of perspectives such a subtle art: the gaping empty begging to be filled and fucked raw, the drops sliding out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Taking his cock in hand, Elidibus guides it into her and slides in smoothly, her head falling back on Emet-Selch’s shoulder."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus’ hands join him to hold her up, and Emet-Selch positions the head of his prick by her entrance, the heat of her and Elidibus burning to be near."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They take turns lapping at the wound Emet-Selch inflicted, while the other kisses her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She has one arm around Emet-Selch’s neck and another on Elidibus’ chest, playing with his nipples."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His eyes meet Elidibus’, whose lips are parted, his hand moving to Emet-Selch’s shoulder, fingers digging in so hard his knuckles turn white."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch is the first to surrender, his thrusts losing any harmonic rhythm as the edge draws closer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch strokes her cheek, watching Elidibus bob his head as he sucks her clit, his tongue folding around it like he needs to wring her out completely."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She flicks her eyes up to meet Emet-Selch’s, and even if it is just this moment, even if this is the very last moment — she is happy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch gives Elidibus a light tug, dragging him up for a kiss, to savor her taste from his lips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch watches the two of them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Stay,” Emet-Selch whispers, not sure which of them he is asking."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch and Elidibus dress in silence, Emet-Selch placing the mask on Elidibus’ face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This is how you create a god: Emet-Selch is the one who holds the knife, the tip of the blade pressing into the soft skin he kissed just hours ago."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Go and be our salvation,” Emet-Selch says, his bloodied fingers touching those lips he only knew for one night."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch stepped forward, not bothering with a portal to pretend he hadn't been there all along."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He was sure that Emet-Selch had a heart beat, that blood might even flow from that body should it be injured."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This took Emet-Selch longer, he was studying the Warrior with that dissecting gaze he sometimes had, like he might tear him apart to see what lay inside of him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch smirked at him, so close and yet not touching, not even moving anymore, except for his eyes to rove over the Warrior, looking deeper than his flesh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That caused Emet-Selch to chuckle, true amusement in the sound."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch-- He could feel his aether stirring, it felt much as it did when he passed through the worlds, untethered, readying for a will not his own to inform its purpose."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades-- This time when Emet-Selch cut him off, it was with his lips crashing into his."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus is better than Emet-Selch at remaining hidden, Altruoix quickly finds."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch fit in so much easier into a crowd, and yet-- The second, more awful, realization hits then, that Emet-Selch had, in truth, revealed himself  deliberately  to Altruoix."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Altruoix had fallen, light bleeding from his splintering soul and so too had Emet-Selch's heart finally broken."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So do Nabriales, Igeyorhm, Lahabrea, Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Perhaps Emet-Selch would be cross at him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Didn’t deserve it when Emet-Selch let me grace his bed, either."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Merely hauls himself up by the folds in Hades's robes to gasp greedily against a mouth half through its diatribe."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So too had Emet-Selch's survival been assured."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sees Hades -  truly  Hades, stripped of the fascinations of emperor and primal servant both, triumphant."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He cannot manage anger at Emet-Selch's deception - at least, not yet - so he takes advantage while there’s still time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hades's touch trembles against his skin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Wrinkles mar the perfect shape of Emet-Selch’s brow as it twists, the amber pools of his eyes aglow with worry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gods, Hades.” Altruoix’s cheeks dust pink as he looks down, shyly.\r\n\tEmet-Selch's incredulous snort ruffles his ashen locks.\r\n\tHis head drops to Emet-Selch’s shoulder, savoring the petrichor and sandalwood that greets him when he presses his nose to his neck.He's saved one.\r\n\tAltruoix supposes Emet-Selch knows better than anyone that he won’t be swayed from this path - and the man himself is far too stubborn to admit what his heart screams clear as day.\r\n\tAnd when Emet-Selch does deign to break it, well - that’s comfortable, too.\r\n\tAn eternity of grief and disappointment lifts just enough to see the sun beneath the blackened pall that has sat over Hades since the Sundering.\r\n\tThe snap that heralds his arrival makes Emet-Selch’s feelings clear.Azem is their hope.\r\n\tHe wants it so bad that he's stopped checking for any smarmy reactions from Emet-Selch to respond to.\r\n\tAbove him through the fog Emet-Selch is a sloppy, wanton mess, damp hair plastered across his sharp cheeks, clinging to plush lips.\r\n\tI am Hades.\r\n\tIt pierces through Emet-Selch's torso, night pouring from his kiss into Altruoix.He pushes harder.\r\n\tIt slips from Hades to himself, tearing his belly open.\r\n\tOut of the corner of his eye he sees his observer flinch, and Elidibus wonders if the flatness of it hurts worse than Lahabrea’s rage or Emet-Selch’s resignation.\r\n\tIt’s not unlike where he found himself just a short time before, and for a moment he wonders if he’d found himself back in the Rift - and by proxy, in Emet-Selch’s arms - again.\r\n\tTechnically dead, if you think about it.” With purpose wrest and names laid bare, neither Hades nor Themis truly qualified as the villains they once were."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch will be proud.“An impressive stretching of the truth!” A slow clap, from the side of the Tower’s throne."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elidibus clutched to his chest, he uses the last of his strength to get to his feet, grabs Emet-Selch by the cowl of his robe, and kisses him.Then, pulling away, he punches Emet-Selch as hard as a man who has just pulled a friend-cum-primal free from another primal can."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No one can tell if the blood on his face is from Altruoix’s wounds or if he’s actually managed to injure Emet-Selch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Eyes wide, a hand to his nose, Emet-Selch takes a step back, the performative edge in his voice receding."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades,” he mumbles."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emet-Selch lifts Elidibus up into his arms, careful not to jostle him too harshly as he turns."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then, there’s the telltale drone of a portal, and both Hades and Themis are gone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Still wonder what Emet-Selch means to him, because he  cares )."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I can see why Emet-Selch was so fond of you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If only Emet-Selch was here to slap again for this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He’s seen Emet-Selch’s heart and the feeling is, regrettably, mutual."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What Emet-Selch wrought pales in comparison to the real thing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Took you long enough,” Emet-Selch’s voice gripes from across the apartment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He does not think he is particularly ripe - not as bad as he had been at Eulmore, in any case,  but–“Far be it for me to offend the most  eminent  Emet-Selch with my  body odor  ,” he replies, with a wink."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not that he has a chance to, because Emet-Selch shoos him through the doorway, past the bedroom study and into the bathroom before he can even get a look at his surroundings any further."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Hades hates when you waste the AC,” Altruoix says offhandedly, as if it were the most natural thing in the world to know what AC was or to use the man’s bare name."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “‘Tis good then that  Hades  is not here,” Elidibus says, after a prolonged beat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The thought of Emet-Selch, sorcerer of eld - fleeing at the prospect of another rebuke, Elidibus opening a window to spite him finally strikes Altruoix as as funny as it ought to be."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “I would not say it too loudly, Most Eminent Emet-Selch, lest you–” “Zodiark help me,” Emet-Selch groans, “the first thing you regain is that wagging tongue  and  he has an epithet for you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “And to think, I was  worried about you when I found you both, incoherent, on my bed!” Emet-Selch, one hand to his breast, the other over his brow, flops onto the remaining space on said bed, his own robes melting away as he tucks himself beneath the sheets."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “It was well in hand, Emet-Selch."}
