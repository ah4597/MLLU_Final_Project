	Master Samwise, a moment of your time?
	To my knowledge, it has not happened before.
	Isildur had a wife, but she was not with him at Mordor when he cut it from Sauron’s hand.
	Méagol did not have anyone, unless he and Déagol - but if so, that was not enough to stop the sway of the thing.
	I do not think any other bearer of the One Ring was in love, so I cannot guess what effect it will have.
	But it must be discussed.
	Yes, yes, of course he is.
	And this presents a question.
	Will your love protect him from the corrupting influence of the Ring?
	Or will the Ring use that love to whisper louder in Frodo’s ear?
	The Ring feeds off desire.
	It promises to achieve anything that the bearer should wish.
	So we must assume that the presence of desire would give it more power over Frodo.
	The Ring eats at the mind, stealing memories and personhood and replacing them with an all-consuming obsession.
	Hobbits are much tougher than anyone gives them credit for.
	Yes. Yes, I think that will be best, despite the risk.
	You will need to help him keep a hold of himself.
	Our Frodo is strong, but the Ring is stronger. It already reaches into his mind.
	There is absolutely no point in cultivating those lofty qualities, if they are not in the service of others.
	I see you have not changed.
	For a time, but I was sent back.
	My work here is not yet done.
	I am Saruman, in a way.
	Or, rather, I am Saruman as he should have been.
	I'm afraid not, my dear.
	You will follow after him one day, but he can no longer follow you.
	I missed you as well.
	Under that. Glorfindel stayed to make sure no one else tried to take it.
	He has locked himself away and is no longer a threat to anyone.
	The Ents will guard him until my return.
	It marches on Rohan and will not stop simply because its master no longer has power.
	Or, rather, I am Saruman as he should have been.
	It marches on Rohan and will not stop simply because its master no longer has power.
	Thengel has chosen to take his people to Helm's Deep against my advice.
	His only hope now will be if his own army arrives in time to save him.
	I would explain them to you if I had the time.
	The circumstances are not normal.
	You must move on as well, and into dangers far greater than I will face.
	I do not know, dear Bilba.
	It is my hope.
	In many ways, it is far more powerful than I ever dared to think at first.
	So powerful that it would utterly overcome anyone of mortal race from this world who possessed it.
	It would possess him.
	A mortal, Maura, who keeps one of the Great Rings, does not die, but he does not grow or obtain more life, he merely continues, until at least every minute is a weariness.
	And if he often uses the Ring to make himself invisible, he fades: he becomes in the end invisible permanently.
	Yes, sooner or later--later, if he is strong or well-meaning, to begin with, but neither strength nor good purpose will last--sooner or later the Dark Power will devour him.
	There were only three Great Rings made by the elves.
	These rings have powers of preservation when wielded by those not constrained by mortality.
	But if you mean ‘know about this ring,’ well, I still do not know, one might say.
	So he is seeking it, seeking it, and all his thoughts are bent on it.
	He set out and came back westward, as far as the Great River.
	With that power, I should have power too great and terrible.
	And over me, the Ring would gain a power still greater and more deadly.
	Do not tempt me! For I do not wish to become like the Dark Lord himself!
	What are you thinking about? Have you decided what to do?
	There are three great and wise Elves left on these shores of Middle Earth, Cirdan the Shipwright in the Gray Havens, Elrond Peredhel in Imladris, and the Lady Galadriel in Lothlorien.
	He is the highest and most noble of the Teleri.
	Her beauty is unrivaled, her wisdom wide, and her compassion deep.
	Ah, so you are a full-grown halfling at last.
	No, I suppose it doesn’t now.
	I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond, for the Black Speech of Mordor may yet be heard in every corner of the West!
	Aragorn is right, we cannot use it.
	We can carry all the bandages and antidotes we wish, but that would be no substitute for a trained healer.
	And bar Lord Elrond himself, I doubt you could hope to find one present and willing with a steadier hand and a calmer head than his own apprentice.
	That is something you cannot ask of me.
	The Black Speech is not a tongue to be thrown around casually.
	Were it not for Vilya’s protection over the Imladris Valley I would not have dared voice it at the Council either.
	You saw a fragment of your past, did you not?
	There is a reason I supported your enthusiasm to join our company.
	He spoke highly of you, you know.
	And that alone is not a good enough reason to endanger us all by speaking the tongue of Mordor aloud here.
	I don’t believe your role in this company will be quite as insignificant as you believe, my dear.
	I would not take the road through Moria unless I had no other choice.
	Yes, so much so that even their own masters cannot find them, if their secrets are forgotten.
	If you are a friend, speak the password and the doors will open.
	We now have but one choice. We must face the long dark of Moria.
	Bilbo had a set of mithril rings that Thorin gave him.
	I never told him, but it’s worth was greater than that of the Shire.
	I supposed we shall find out.
	Though let us hope we don’t find ourselves in need of healer quite this early into our journey.
	Do you know if he plans to travel again? Bilbo always did like a good adventure.
	Well, I may be seeing Bilbo again soon.
	At this rate Frodo will never see that book.
	I'm afraid I haven't much time to talk as I'm in quite a rush, so do be quick about it.
	I'm afraid I don't understand.
	You're awake. Good, good.
	You are in Minas Tirith, as I imagine the white stone gives away.
	You would not. You were afflicted with the Black Breath of a Nazgûl.
	You have slept the night and over half the day away.
	It is not truly breath, for they draw none.
	But it is the manifestation of their endless malice in sickness.
	It saps the mind and body, and the soul falls into such despair it may never wake.
	An interesting phenomenon to be sure.
	Where there was none before there is a little now.
	You are not the same person as the one I met.
	I am afraid I do not know.
	Perhaps in time you will learn more, and perhaps not.
	There are many mysteries in life.
	I could not have been there, though I desired to be.
	No, and as it were I had no plans to be.
	Gathering information on Hobbits, you say?
	My, my, you are treating your new responsibility rather seriously.
	Which is wonderful.
	I would not expect anything but your utmost care to go into the hosting of Bilbo and his kin.
	No, of course not, Master Dwalin.
	Considering that these few Hobbits might possibly be the last in the history of Middle-earth, I wouldn’t be concerned in the least!
	This is the reason for my visit, you see?
	You hold a very important task and I hope you do not treat it lightly.
	Hm. Yes. I suppose that is important...
	But Hobbits eat six meals whenever they can, not daily.
	Though I suppose you’re going to need to know the daily schedule in this instance…
	Yes, it’d be especially good to know it.
	They need to gain some more meat on their bones if they’re to reach the proper standards...
	Yes, well, I suppose there is no use in hiding it from you.
	Oh relax, you smothering dwarf!
	It is rather important to know…
	Need I remind you that he is being escorted here by seven of your Company members?
	Their journey here is the least of your worries.
	He’s perfectly capable of caring for himself.
	I am not sending him here for you to protect.
	Well, you certainly got yourself even more lost if you've found yourself in elven lands.
	Try with something smaller.
	Only, it is different with her.
	Her time is yet to come.
	Need I remind you of Glorfindel.
	My dear, we all wish that we were not burdened by expectations and responsibility and yet, we cannot question our destiny.
	You were brought to us for a purpose, and maybe only then will you be able to go home.
	What brings you here, my dear?
	You're in luck! I was just about to go there myself.
	Poor Samwise has barely had enough time to rest.
	Ah, I see. Men are very easily seduced by the Ring's power.
	The Nazgûl were Númemoreans.
	They used to be great and ruled powerful kingdoms, now they are no more than slaves to evil.
	It has managed to ensnare the minds of noble men, and instilled fear and discord among the people of Middle-earth.
	And it has a will of its own.
	Sauron poured into that Ring his own malice and power.
	As such, that Ring can never be used for good.
	It controls all the other Rings of Power.
	With it, Sauron ravaged Middle-earth with no mercy.
	If he finds that Ring now, I do not think he will stop.
	The world is changed indeed, if I am to be named a bearer of good news!
	But you are right, of course.
	I do bring good news, and more than news. I bring you my friends.
	Surely you have earned the right to speak what is in your heart.
	You want to know what my friends are, and you are trying to figure out how to ask without throwing them quite out of countenance.
	I shall tell you. They are hobbits.
	They are mortals, they are small, they are ridiculous, and they shall be held no less in honor than the greatest among you.
	And knowing them, they are also probably hungry, so let us find them some lunch without delay!
	Your history was dark, but its ending is not so.
	The shadow passes, the hurts are healed, and everyone comes home.
	Of course you are welcome to settle wherever you like.
	Oh, certainly nothing that you need to bring, but have a care!
	Their arts are deep indeed, but they are not accustomed to caring for mortals and their medicines may be too strong for you.
	That description is both true and accurate, Bilbo Baggins!
	And it’s a good thing for you that Námo hasn’t had a careless thought in all the ages of the world.
	But if you have lived a lifetime and a half and you still have no more sense than to look one of the Powers in the eye, then I don’t know what I am to do with you.
	No more than you have, you with your prepared speeches!
	Oh, they’ll get used to it. So will you; it will be good for you.
	Not all that is beloved endures; there is no endurance but love.
	He would hardly believe it even from me when I told him to expect you.
	We will expect you to recount all of that later, Boromir, so I hope you have committed it to memory.
	Meriadoc Brandybuck, I know enough of your family history, Took and Brandybuck and whatever else may please you, that I would advise you not go down that path lest I get the itch to begin telling stories after dinner.
	I knew that Bilbo could be the finest hobbit in the Shire if only I could wake up a little more Took in him.
	And my plan turned out quite well in the end, don't you think?
	Come now, we have squandered enough time on Master Greenleaf's archery lesson.
	Come along, all of you, we must continue.
	Hobbits are quite indulgent toward their offspring, and that rapscallion is the beloved baby of both the Took and Brandybuck clans.
	He has never been handled with anything but the utmost care in all his life.
	Just a mouthful each -- for all of us. It is very precious. It is miruvor, the cordial of Imladris. Elrond gave it to me at our parting. Pass it round!
	If there are any watchers that can endure this storm, then they can see us, fire or no.
	If there are any to see, then I at least am revealed to them.
	Do you think you could safely reach this side with the additional weight?
	Come along then. You have all jumped this far before without even knowing it.
	Just give yourselves a bit of a run to start, and you will be fine.
	Come along, we are dallying when we should be walking.
	I am certain they can cross it, if they can overcome their fear.
	Hobbits, in general, are very concerned with social order and the proper way of doing things.
	Do not forget that the three cousins over there also are members of the highest echelon of hobbit society, so these habits are even more ingrained in them.
	That is why he gets to go first.
	Next to class distinction, seniority in the family line is the most important factor in hobbit society.
