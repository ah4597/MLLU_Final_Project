<|endoftext|>Emet-Selch: I am Emet-Selch. Ascian. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Urianger: That an Ascian of Emet-Selch's standing should willingly reveal himself unto us─and at this of all junctures─is...most interesting. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ardbert: From the Exarch, is it? With that mirror of his, he can watch your every move, you know. He'll probably think you're talking to yourself. Still, he's keeping you well-fed. Judging by his people's faith in him, he seems to be a decent sort. But so much about him remains shrouded in mystery. Like what was he doing back in my day? There was no such person when I was around. A lot's happened since the Flood, though. Since I was...set adrift. I know little more than you do of this city's history and the Exarch's past. Not that it matters. It's Emet-Selch we should be concerned about. When our world was about to be consumed by Light, the Ascian in white appeared before us. He said that the only way for us to live on was to bring about the Rejoining. Desperate as we were, we heeded his words, not realizing that the Flood was of the Ascians' own making. They cannot be trusted. None of them. But Emet-Selch had one thing right: one should not fight blindly. That's what we did. And it cost us everything we held dear. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thancred: That ended a lot better than it might have. No thanks to Emet-Selch... <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Urianger: Emet-Selch, the Ascian of whom I spoke. 'Twas he who plucked thee from the Lifestream. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Y'shtola: Did Emet-Selch not return with you? <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thancred: Though I struggle to form the words...I am glad that Emet-Selch was here. We can but pray Y'shtola never does anything so reckless again. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thancred: Though I struggle to form the words...I am glad that Emet-Selch was here. We can but pray Y'shtola never does anything so reckless again. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Y'shtola: That was an enlightening experience. Though not in the way I had hoped. Do you suppose there is any truth in Emet-Selch's claims? <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Y'shtola: Though recent events plainly warrant further discussion, I think it best that we wait until Alphinaud and the others are present. ...Emet-Selch included. How convenient that he should choose this moment to keep to the shadows. Well...no matter. For the present, we should return to Fanow and make certain of the Eulmorans' withdrawal. After that, Slitherbough. The Blessed are no doubt elated by what has become of the sky. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Minfilia: I know he said he would be watching from the shadows, but doesn't it seem wrong to leave without at least telling Emet-Selch? <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Y'shtola: Is this not the moment Emet-Selch usually chooses to descend upon us? Whatever will we do without his feigned praise and backhanded compliments? <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Y'shtola: Is this not the moment Emet-Selch usually chooses to descend upon us? Whatever will we do without his feigned praise and backhanded compliments? <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ardbert: It's alive. I don't know if you remember, but when we first met in this world, I was all but spent. I never thought to wonder why until now. I think it all just got to be too much. The guilt of causing the Flood... Knowing everyone hated me... But the worst thing was the solitude. Time wears you down, aye...but solitude eats away at you. It was this close to finishing me off. But as bad as it got, and as empty as I felt...I can't even begin to imagine what it must be like for Emet-Selch. All of which is a long way of saying: don't make a choice that leaves you alone. Nothing is worth that─especially not eternity. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Varis: And what of Emet-Selch? <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ardbert: After you collapsed, Emet-Selch vanished. Then Ryne did what she could to stay the raging of the Light within your body. Thanks to her, you're still you, but she's only delayed the inevitable. You're not going to like what you see, but you still need to see it. It's like this all over. The whole of Norvrandt is shrouded in Light again. And it's because of you and the power you absorbed from the Wardens. No one knows but your friends. When they carried you down from the mountain, they told everyone waiting below that they didn't understand why the Light had returned. And now they're out there trying to allay the people's fears while searching for a way to save you. If you're well enough to be up, you're well enough to get some fresh air. Better that than stewing in here. Go on. Go. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Urianger: Thou didst plan to commandeer an amaro for thy journey to the open sea? I fear the following dive down unto Emet-Selch's underwater abode would drain even thy legendary stamina... Thus, during thy convalescence, we considered the most efficacious method for reaching the depths of the Tempest. And I believe we have arrived at an elegant solution. Yet ere we discuss this step, I suggest thou dost conclude such pressing business as remains to thee in the Crystarium. Once the sea closeth above our heads, we are unlikely to surface again until our grand deed is done. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thancred: With all that water out of the way, we'll be able to venture quite some distance. Emet-Selch must be hiding around here somewhere... <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Urianger: Haaa... Haaa...<gulp> Full glad am I...that Bismarck was true to his word. We are arrived in the Tempest, safe and dry. 'Tis here that we shall find the lair of Emet-Selch, and, I believe, the imprisoned Exarch as well. For an Ascian alone, it is of course a trifling matter to flee unto the rift─yet I suspect such travel is nigh impossible with a mortal in one's custody. Nay, he would not soon risk his prize when the Exarch's very body serveth as the key to the Crystal Tower and its powers of temporal transportation. Thus am I all but certain that this underwater realm harboreth our friend and enemy both. We have but to find them. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thancred: Now, as for where we should be looking, I rather doubt Emet-Selch will be sitting around out in the open. I propose we follow the slope down towards the deeper trenches, and keep an eye out for rock formations large enough to house a stronghold. Let's be off, then─but watch your footing. The ground is still wet, and like to be slippery. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Alisaie: I think Thancred has the right idea, but I can't help wondering what Emet-Selch would be doing down here without the aid of gills and fins. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ryne: The gloom down here is so suffocating compared to that endless night sky we saw... But I suppose Emet-Selch had nowhere else to go. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ryne: Yes, I'd like to know more about this “illuminated land” the chieftain spoke of. Could it be Emet-Selch's stronghold, do you suppose? Perhaps he...lit the lanterns upon his return? <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Y'shtola: And what have you discovered? Yes, I would agree that the windows are most distinctive. 'Twould seem the structures appear the same to both your sight and mine... And you say you could not so much as scratch the wall? Even with all your might behind the blade? Forename, everywhere I turn in this place, my gaze is drawn by peculiar materials for which I do not have a name. The buildings I had you investigate are prime examples. They may appear to be constructed of ordinary stone, but I assure you it is nothing of the sort... If pressed, I would describe the substance as a composite of several mineral properties, blended to create a material of unparalleled durability. Even the Ronkan Empire, once the greatest power in Norvrandt, produced nothing which compares to this level of perfection. But if not the Ronka, then who? Who were these ancients the Ondo claim as the architects of their sanctuary? I suspect our answer lies with the reason Emet-Selch withdrew here to the Tempest. He may simply have wished to retreat somewhere mere mortals would struggle to reach...but there are many such remote locations. Why here, specifically? Emet-Selch is devoted to his role, and thus we might assume his choice of stronghold somehow serves the Ascian agenda. Or mayhap...'tis a place more dear to him than any other. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Y'shtola: Such traces in the Source would have been obliterated by the succession of Umbral Calamities, but here in the First they might have remained untouched for millennia... ...A copy of the mural in the Qitana Ravel. Almet presented it to me during my visit to Fanow, after our victory in Kholusia. Here, in the first scene... By Emet-Selch's own words, it depicts a city of eons past and the disaster which befell it. The design is much simplified, of course, but do you see the similarities between its towers and those you have just inspected? We are close to the truth, I feel. Let us search the surrounds for another tower─one which matches the picture near enough to remove all doubt. From what I have seen, naught more than sand and more sand lies to the east, and the south held no such structures. I suggest we try our luck further to the northwest. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Y'shtola: Aye... This is the mural writ large... Though I cannot guess at its purpose, it must have been an imposing sight. How much of the tower's height lies hidden beneath the ground, I wonder... Centuries of our history have settled upon such ruins. Countless layers of dust and sediment... ...An entire civilization, its existence forgotten by all except a handful of Ascians. And yet it did exist. They lived here, in this city... But let us focus on what we've learned thus far. The Ondo chieftain spoke of mysteries stirring─of a land illuminated. Judging by his words, he believes this phenomenon related to the ancients' return. Thus can we surmise that what the Ondo saw shining in the abyss was, in all likelihood, yet another remnant of this age-old civilization. And who else would “light the lanterns” as Ryne put it, than Emet-Selch himself? 'Tis almost certain he is there! <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Alisaie: An Ascian homeland... Despite his many protestations, I never quite believed Emet-Selch was telling the truth. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Alisaie: If Emet-Selch is in that trench, then we'll have to assume he's not swimming in saltwater. I wouldn't want to suddenly find ourselves at the edge of Bismarck's bubble with no air to breathe... <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Urianger: Emet-Selch hath made himself difficult to reach, yet every step we take bringeth us nearer to his stronghold. Let us not linger, lest the Exarch suffer for our late arrival. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Alphinaud: Emet-Selch holds the Exarch captive somewhere within that vast city... Yet even if we must search every alleyway, we will find them! <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Alisaie: When the chieftain spoke of lights shining from the abyss, this is not at all what I imagined. Why would Emet-Selch do this...? <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Y'shtola: Forename, did you note the style of the architecture? 'Tis the same used for the remnants at the Cups and the mural's painted towers. Look closely. Emet-Selch has not simply reclaimed these ruins...he has layered the semblance of an entire city upon them. Gods, the magnitude of his artifice is staggering. Though it pains me to admit, we did not fully understand the feats of which an old world Ascian is capable... <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Alphinaud: Emet-Selch holds the Exarch captive somewhere within that vast city... Yet even if we must search every alleyway, we will find them! <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Urianger: Mayhap it is not so passing strange... Did Emet-Selch not invite Forename to visit his abode? 'Tis plain thy coming was expected. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Alisaie: So Emet-Selch isn't the leader here... <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Robed Giant: Emet-Selch is a member of the Convocation. Were you hoping to witness its deeds firsthand? <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Y'shtola: To my eyes, these people appear as arcane entities. I suspect Emet-Selch wove them from aether, much as he reconstructed the rest of the city... <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Urianger: I believe thou hast the right of it, Master Alphinaud. This aetherial Amaurot and its residents appear to be phantoms of a different age. Emet-Selch hath resurrected a memory─a moment in time from before the star was sundered. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Optimisitic Amaurotine: Hm? 'Twould seem the Hall is host to a most precocious visitor this day. And what, pray tell, shall be the subject of our discussion, young one? Ah...the Convocation and their handling of the coming peril. 'Tis only natural that you should have questions. Shall we begin with the members themselves? As all know, the Fourteen are the wisest and most puissant among us. They are the stewards of order, responsible for decisions which keep this star turning season after season. Be it the speaker, Lahabrea, or the emissary, Elidibus, each seat is occupied by an elected sage of surpassing intellect. Loghrif, Mitron, Emet-Selch... Their individual titles have, as a gesture of respect and a matter of tradition, become synonymous with their incumbents. Thus it is with great incredulity that I greet this recent rumor that a seat in the Convocation is soon to be left vacant. If proven true, 'twould be an unprecedented development─and testament to the immense pressure under which our saviors are toiling... In any event, I for one am confident they shall deliver our star unto salvation. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Pragmatic Amaurotine: An audience with Emet-Selch? I am afraid you have the wrong office, little one. And besides, he will be far too busy to field the questions of curious children. Surely you have been told of the looming catastrophe? Every resource available to the Convocation must be spent upon ensuring our world survives. They have yet to make an official announcement, but it is said the Fourteen are moving forward with a plan of scarce credible proportions─one which promises to grant will to the very star itself! They will invoke our mightiest spells of creation to birth an entity of all-encompassing magnificence...and then they will rewrite the laws of existence. 'Tis a huge undertaking, and it must be completed ere the corruption spreads this far. Thus I say to you again: do not hold out hope for an audience... <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Alphinaud: Forename. If I was not certain before, then I am now─the people of this city believe they face the end of the world. I cannot imagine what purpose compelled Emet-Selch to recreate this ancient “Amaurot.” And yet...I fancy I hear his words to us echoing throughout this ocean trench. He would have his story known. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Alisaie: An interesting matter which no doubt bears further study. But despite all these revelations, I worry we are no closer to finding Emet-Selch. Has anyone learned aught which might lead us to his location? <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Administrative Clerk: Forename Surname. Your application is ready for collection. As your residency was approved by Emet-Selch himself, further forms of identification will not be required. Here are your application documents. Submit them at the Bureau of the Secretariat and the clerk will issue you with a visitor's writ for the Capitol. Your visitor's writ will be issued at the Bureau of the Secretariat. Just submit those application documents to the clerk on duty... <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>???: ...May I? You, I think, are from a time beyond ours. Have you followed in the wake of Emet-Selch? Nay, there is no cause for alarm. I am simply a shade. Here and not here. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hythlodaeus: I know only that my name is Hythlodaeus, and that this city is a recreation─a phantom moment plucked from the well of history. These others seem unaware of their pale existence, but I wonder if Emet-Selch's mind was distracted when it came to my reconstitution. A stray thought would have been enough. “Hythlodaeus will realize the truth,” for example. We were...close friends once, you see... Yet in spite of my perception, I play the same role as all the rest─a bit part, meant to bring color and noise to this well-crafted stage. Too much scrutiny, and we shall burst like the fragile bubbles we are. Thus I tell you again: my presence is naught to concern you. I wish only to share your company whilst we wait. ...If you've come this far, then you know of the catastrophe which awaits us on our “morrow.” The Final Days. What began as isolated incidents soon swelled into a world-spanning threat... The Convocation of Fourteen─well, it was Thirteen at the time─endeavored to create a will for our star. They would repair the fundamental laws of order and halt the spread of destruction. But creation on such a scale required an immense source of power... Of those of us who still lived, nearly half offered up their lives in the name of salvation. And from their sacrifice, Zodiark was born. Just as we had hoped, He reached forth and halted the march of oblivion. ...Yet oh how the star had suffered. So many species lost. The land was blighted, the waters poisoned, and even the wind had ceased to blow. Once more did our people give of themselves to Zodiark. Another half of our race sacrificed to cleanse the world; to ensure that trees and grasses and myriad tiny lives would sprout and grow and flourish. The cycle of life had begun anew, and we reconsidered the means by which we might protect it. The Convocation decided thus: we would nurture our world until it was bursting with vitality. Then, when the time was right, we would offer some portion of its living energy to Zodiark... In return, He would restore to us those brethren whose souls had fed His strength, and together we would resume our role as stewards. There were, however, those who disagreed with this plan. They argued that enough had been sacrificed to Zodiark─that this new world should belong to the lives newly born. These dissidents surrendered their life energies in the creation of Hydaelyn, an incarnation of their opposing belief. And for the first time in history, our people stood divided... Know you, then, how this conflict ended? ...Hm, I thought you might. Emet-Selch has ever been a champion for the will of Zodiark. The original plan may have been set back by millennia, but he will have not abandoned his course. He will pay the price for our return by whatever means is necessary. And though he may carry himself with a certain glib ease, Emet-Selch is not a man to bear his burdens lightly. In fact, I imagine they have only grown heavier with every passing century... ...'Tis truly a terrible weight he has chosen to carry. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hythlodaeus: It seems your turn has come. Pray do not let me keep you. ...Ah, there was one last thing. You walk with another at your side, yes? Nay, I see no definite form...just the faintest suggestion of a second soul. I doubt it visible to anyone but me. Otherwise, I assume only you can see and hear this ethereal companion? Hm hm hm... Your connection is hardly a coincidence. In our time, the two of you were one─the color of your souls tells the tale. A hue that distinctive cannot be mistaken, no matter how thin the soul is spread. Hah! This is just the kind of fate I might expect for one such as he. Surely Emet-Selch has recognized the hint of “him” in you...? <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Urianger: The Capitol boasteth not a single armed sentry. 'Twould seem that in their time, they did not deem it needful to post guards. The windows and doors, however, appear heavily warded. Though mightily did we strive, with strength mundane and magical, we failed to budge them even a fraction of one ilm. Mayhap 'twas simply the case that Emet-Selch's recreation did not extend to their usual function. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Alisaie: Of course not. And that's to say naught of what Emet-Selch plans for the Exarch's power. Do we stand by and let him threaten our future as well as our past? We need to find him, Forename. And when we do... Make your mark. Change the course of history in a way that's felt by those who came before, and those who came after; by everyone you've ever met. Change things so that even my other self, dying somewhere in that future Calamity will smile and say, “I knew you would win.” <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ryne: ...Is fighting Emet-Selch the only way? He created an entire city. It will take everything we have to defeat him...if we even can. And if you push that hard in your current state, the Light will break free... <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Urianger: As well thou knowest, if we are to usher Emet-Selch unto his rest, we must needs bind his Ascian soul...and then shatter it with overwhelming force. The former task requireth auracite, and such have I prepared─upon the Exarch's asking, no less, though 'twas ever mine intent to provide said boon. The future whence our noble friend doth hail is a world fallen to Ascian artifice, and he would not see such grim history repeated. In a sense, Emet-Selch's destruction will be the culmination of the Exarch's efforts─a reward for all he hath endured these many years. Yet even as thou stridest into the jaws of peril, forget not but that his fondest wish─and that of many others, besides─is to see thee survive unto the morrow. 'Tis in pursuit of that happiest of outcomes that I do pledge to remain at thy side. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Alphinaud: Emet-Selch! <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Alphinaud: Emet-Selch! We understand. Truly. But it makes no difference. The ones you love are in the past. While ours are here in the present. One day, we too will be ashes and dust, but not today. Our time is not yet finished. We share your conviction...and that is why we will not abandon our course. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Urianger: In those Final Days, 'tis said that monstrous beasts were set loose in the city-terrors made flesh by sorceries run rampant. If Emet-Selch hath been faithful in his reconstruction, then we must be prepared to face many such abominations. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Y'shtola: I reasoned that Emet-Selch would not harm the Exarch until he had learned the tower's secrets, but his parting words suggest otherwise. Let us make haste. Your friend may not have the luxury of decades to wait for you this time. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Emet-Selch: Very well. Let us proceed to your final judgment. The victor shall write the tale, and the vanquished become its villain! But come! Let us cast aside titles and pretense, and reveal our true faces to one another! I am Hades! He who shall awaken our brethren from their dark slumber! <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Alphinaud: It's over. Emet-Selch is no more! <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ryne: No. It's more than that. Under the strain of that incredible flood of aether, your soul had begun to break apart. Yet now it seems somehow...restored. I tried to help you before the battle, but Emet-Selch stopped me. So, h-how did you─exactly what did you... Can you tell us what happened? <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Elidibus: Oblivion has claimed him... Emet-Selch...gone. Lahabrea...gone. I alone remain-the last of the unbroken. Once more, I am moved to reevaluate the potential of these tattered souls. Ah, Zenos. Never did I dream you could overpower me so completely, possessed as I was of your body, and all its uncanny strength... And now that I have shared with you the truth of this world and its reflections, who can predict how events will unfold? ...Not I. “Emissary”... What a poor jest that title has become. The flow of history has become muddied, its currents wild beyond my capacity to direct them. You have wrested the advantage, Hydaelyn. The thieving hands of Your disciples tighten their grip on our star.  The origins of the world remain hidden and its inhabitants ignorant of their broken existence, just as You and Your creators desired. They celebrate the gift of imperfect life-uncaring, unknowing as we weaken and fade. But do not imagine Yourself rid of us. Though Your champion has indeed proven the most egregious obstacle to our ascendance─a barbed thorn in my side─he may yet be removed and cast into the abyss. Oh yes...it can be done. I will keep these “heroes” mired in the First, and victory will be ours at the last. Warriors of Darkness now, are they? Then their fate is decided. They shall meet the same end as those who came before─death at the hands of Warriors of Light! <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Y'shtola: There you are. I take it there were no pressing matters to keep you in the Source, then? If not, I may have need of you in the near future. There is still yet so much to be learned of this world. So many mysteries begging to be solved. The greatest perhaps being the truth of Emet-Selch's words that fateful day in the Qitana Ravel. A most troubling matter to be sure, but remember: it is not a burden you must bear alone. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Crystal Exarch: Thanks to all of you, however, their lot has changed, and now they may heed the long-forgotten truth. You claimed it was Ardbert who helped you overcome Emet-Selch, correct? Such a revelation would do well to sway the hearts of those who know him only as a villain. I have shared this with a select few, but one and all must be told of his sacrifice. To that end I say we proceed with Alphinaud's plan. We call together the people of the Crystarium and recount to them the true tale of the Warriors of Light and the Flood that followed in their wake. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Y'shtola: Nor I. To my eyes, your aether burns as brightly as the day you slew Emet-Selch. That is proof that he is with you still. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Urianger: Elidibus. That Zenos hath reclaimed his own flesh is known. Thus evicted from his borrowed form...and cognizant, no doubt, of Emet-Selch's failure here in the First... 'Tis quite possible the emissary chose Ardbert for his next vessel. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Y'shtola: And they have gained much by it. Emet-Selch single-handedly built the Garlean Empire in this manner, while Lahabrea came close to conquering Eorzea having taken possession of Thancred's living body. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Y'shtola: We were a hair's breadth from defeat when we faced Emet-Selch, and now we must contend with yet another Ascian. We must tread carefully. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Y'shtola: Hmmm... Then I think it time I return to the Greatwood. Until now, everything we have learned of the Ascians has been handed to us at their leisure. But that was one of Emet-Selch's unique failings. I have no reason to think Elidibus will be as forthcoming. Fortunately, I recently received word from Fanow that heretofore unexplored chambers have been discovered deep within the Qitana Ravel. Almet believes the relics within tell of a great calamity that befell an ancient civilization─that of the Ascians, perhaps. They may lead us to the truths we seek. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Y'shtola: Even Emet-Selch was taken aback to find a mural illustrating the Final Days in these ruins. What other surprises do you suppose yet lie within? <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Y'shtola: Naught less than the Echo. In which case...none of this is mere coincidence. A shower of stars setting the sky aflame─and in both this world and the Source, we find individuals within whom a mysterious power awakened at the sight. We could never unpick the why of it. Now, however...I believe we might. Does the scene depicted here not resemble the one we saw when we first ventured into the Qitana Ravel? Moreover, does it not recall that which Emet-Selch invited us to witness in Amaurot? The Final Days. If, as the Exarch's research suggests, soul and mind share a fragile yet profound bond, might it not be possible for an event to leave such a deep imprint upon the soul that it could be perceived eons later─given a suitable trigger? The Echo defies explanation by conventional aetherological theory. Or shall we say, modern aetherological theory. But if it is a power that once belonged to the ancients, to souls yet undivided... It would seem I have entered the realm of pure speculation. And I call myself a scholar. I shall refrain from making any further wild claims until such time as I have evidence. Still, I cannot choose but be reminded of our experience in Amaurot... <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Y'shtola: Your mothers were wise. Though we witnessed the Final Days, our impressions could not fail to be colored by our own experiences and expectations. Those who lived through it would have perceived the event quite differently. We must bear in mind that it is no simple matter to keep the truth alive, or it will die with Emet-Selch and his kin. But we have disturbed Tiuna long enough. Fanow will serve similarly well as a venue for our contemplations. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Elidibus: Yes, it is I, Elidibus. Through your time in Emet-Selch's imitation of our home, I daresay you have gained a better understanding of my role since last we met. Not that it matters. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Alphinaud: Once, I would have said your goal was destruction alone. Now I understand that you fight for something you love, just as we do. Yet though we seem doomed to clash, I bid you consider Emet-Selch's final words. "Remember that we once lived," he said. Had he not seen some glimmer of hope in our kind, I do not believe he would have spoken thus. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Elidibus: Emet-Selch... How very unlike you, to err so gravely. That one should stray at the end of so onerous a path is understandable, but I had thought you above such weakness. Mayhap you thought the same. Would that I had been present to offer correction... But I shall do so now, as is my duty, and return all to its proper course. As for you... Look at yourselves. Look at your history. Look back one hundred short years, to how your greatest warriors were undone. And now? At but a word from me, you raise your hands in answer like the puppets you are. Naught has changed. You fail and you fail and you learn nothing─allow that which is most important to slip through your fumbling fingers like so many grains of sand. Again and again and again. And you would remember us? You do forget yourselves. I have my duty. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Y'shtola: Another visit to the Tempest may shed some light upon these mysteries. Whether we are to exchange words or blows with Elidibus at our next meeting, the fact remains: we know too little. Ere our paths cross again, I would learn more of the world that once was─and of Elidibus himself. In this, we would be best served going directly to his home, much as Emet-Selch came to ours. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Urianger: Though I see the wisdom in thy suggestion, the Amaurot we visited is but a phantom born of Emet-Selch's memory. I fear it will teach us little that we do not already know. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Urianger: For a certainty, Emet-Selch never uttered the name, speak though he did of the schism which Zodiark's advent wrought upon mankind. Some were of the viewpoint that His power must needs be restrained, and to that end did they call forth She who would serve as His shackles. We know now that it was this Venat to whom they looked for leadership. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Alphinaud: I had always assumed Elidibus to be of the same ilk as Lahabrea and Emet-Selch. But if the real Elidibus sacrificed himself before the sundering... <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Urianger: The white-robed emissary hath ever named himself "Elidibus." Yet if the shade spoke true, Elidibus ceased to be ere even the sundering came to pass. This calleth to mind a truth that Emet-Selch did once reveal in passingâ”€that the names by which we know our foes are not those given to Ascians at birth. Rather, they are titles of office, afforded to individuals of merit at such time as the role becometh vacant. Perchance the Elidibus at Zodiark's heart and the emissary with whom we are acquainted be not one and the same, but predecessor and successor. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>White-robed Figure: Indeed... Could Emet-Selch have found a way...? Precious few possess memories of the Final Days. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Elidibus: That which I do is no different from that which you have done so many times, Warrior of Darkness. I arm myself. I hone my skills. I make ready to vanquish my enemy─you. You who have murdered my brothers─who have taken their selfless labors in service to the one true world and turned them to ash. I see you for what you are. You are death, and only in death shall you serve any purpose. The Convocation charged me to steer mankind and the very star upon their true course. As Elidibus, it is my duty. And I shall see it done. I will strike you down... Destroy you body and soul. All else must wait. Ere long I will come for you, Warrior of Darkness. And I will save the world. One last matter. I bore witness to your final struggle with Emet-Selch. It seemed as if he saw something familiar in you. As if he mistook you for another. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Elidibus: An impressive show of strength. But surely no more than a foretaste of that which Emet-Selch's conqueror is capable. Such might requires a fairer measure. To compare like with like. Yes... I shall just have to test you myself. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Elidibus: Correct on all counts. Such is my nature, and such are my methods. I have aided heroes. I have made them. I have even become them. This served not only to strengthen me, but also to facilitate the work of my brothers, such as Emet-Selch, with his penchant for nation building. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hythlodaeus: Heh heh... I see you have been collecting stars. I speak of those crystals. They have constellations etched upon them, yes? High in the heavens, those stars shine their guiding light down upon the lives below. Fitting symbols for the Convocation of Fourteen, would you not agree? As you will have gathered, each crystal bears an account of the life of a member of the Convocation as remembered by the unsundered. Lest you worry, they aren't concepts; they are far too incomplete to be so. But they suffice for imbuing memories within sundered souls, that they might be restored to their office. Keep them. I am sure Emet-Selch wouldn't mind. So, how fare you of late? You are feuding with Elidibus this time, I believe? <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hythlodaeus: Hm... I shall refrain from passing comment on your struggle. It is not my place to do so, long-departed as I am. But if I may give voice to a personal desire...I would rather you lived. If you do not, how will you keep your promise to Emet-Selch? The promise to remember? It must weigh heavy, the burden of all those memories. To one who has lived a life such as yours, I can well imagine how Elidibus's existence might seem hollow─how empty his single-minded pursuit of a half-forgotten cause must appear... But know that his devotion is not without reason. Even if he himself can no longer remember what that reason is. Well, that is quite enough talk about Elidibus. I would see if you can reunite the wayward stars. I mentioned before that there was a member of the Convocation who opposed Zodiark's summoning and defected. One whose office was left vacant... Defectors having been deemed unworthy of commemoration, no crystal exists for the individual in question. ...Or shouldn't exist, at any rate─and wouldn't, had a friend not created one in secret. A crystal bearing the forgotten name of his office, along with a magick of his own conceiving─a singular incantation embodying his spirit. Among all the offices, the Fourteenth was most unusual. For while the rest sat in Amaurot, its holder was charged with gaining an intimate knowledge of the wider world. In the course of his duty, he traveled the length and breadth of every land, and befriended countless folk. He encountered troubles too, of course. Matters which he could simply have referred to the Convocation. But that was not his way. Nay, more often than not, he would call upon his comrades, and together resolve matters themselves. Such is the magick sealed within that crystal─the magick to summon the stars to your side. In time of greatest need, should you wish upon it with all your heart, it will surely answer your call. And now it is where it belongs. Oh, there is no need for thanks. But nor will I hear any complaints about it either. After all, I cannot say whether I act of my own volition or by the will of my recreator! <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Y'shtola: Ahhh... Fresh air at long last. I would celebrate my return to dry land with a pot of tea─had we the luxury of time. But we must be prepared for Elidibus. Given what we know, it is plain he will not be deterred from his course. And nor would I, were I him. Not if it meant forsaking everything I loved. That said, I have not forgotten how Emet-Selch sought to find common ground with us, for all our misgivings. Ultimately, our differences were not to be bridged, of course, but one must always try. Emet-Selch understood this, and if his gesture resonated with you, perhaps you might consider reaching out to his brethren. Though it may all be for naught, you of all people know that there is no such thing as a foregone conclusion. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Elidibus: It was not until I observed the battle between Emet-Selch and the Warrior of Darkness that I realized what I must do. I will summon heroes from other worlds unto the First, just as you did. Their presence shall serve to empower me─granting me the strength to crush my enemy. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Elidibus: Memories of a possible future... Worthless, all. Worthless as memories of the only past. Fated to fray and fade into oblivion. Leaving naught but a gaping void... The Waking...Sands? ...Yes, that was the place. The place I first made myself known to you and yours. The seventh Rejoining had left the realm listing dangerously towards Darkness. And events were unfolding that threatened to push it over the brink. Thus did I approach you, in my capacity as Emissary, thinking that you would make a useful pawn... But I was wrong, and for my misstep did Lahabrea and Emet-Selch pay the ultimate price. Leaving me the last of the unsundered. My remaining brethren, fragmented as they are, cannot hope to see our mission to its end. It falls to me alone. Defeat is not an option. I will strike you down. I will resurrect Lord Zodiark. And I will bring back those who sacrificed themselves to call Him forth. Though it take a thousand thousand years, upon my honor as Elidibus, Emissary of the Convocation of Fourteen, I will see this done. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Y'shtola: A gift from Emet-Selch. He knew of Elidibus's plight. Foreseeing his own death, he made provisions to bring Elidibus's suffering to an end, lest his friend be left to continue the struggle alone. Or so I wildly speculate. It is unlikely we will ever know the truth. The best we can do is to remember events as they happened, no more and no less. As the Ronkans so rightly put it, “History is learned, not lived.” <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Urianger: How many times have we few assembled thus in this storied chamber? Many and more, I think. Were the Exarch standing before us, the scene would be complete. Nay─'twould be complete were he standing before us with Emet-Selch smirking in the wings. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Moren: Ah yes, Hades, he who sought to resurrect his ancient brethren. He was the final obstacle in your quest to restore the night; your battle in the depths of the Tempest the stuff of epics. Yet compelling as it is, I worry that mere words wouldn't do justice to that fateful confrontation... Not that we would think to omit it entirely, of course. No, at the very least, we will impress upon readers that it was the climax of your hero's journey. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hythlodaeus: Now then, our friend Hermes. Aside from overseeing the facility, he also conducts his own research. Chances are he will be at the main observation hub, so let us seek him out there first. Attired as you are, however, you stand out a little too much. Our dear Emet-Selch wishes to keep a low profile for his errand, so... Do you know how to make a robe? The basic concept will do. No? In that case, Emet-Selch─ <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hythlodaeus: Fair point, but at the very least it should spare you unwanted attention from casual observers. Emet-Selch speaks true. Even dressed like us, your unusual nature will be plain to those who think to look. Should someone question your presence, don't make up excuses, much less try to explain what you actually are. No, best to simply say that you're a familiar. The question is whose... Ah, of course─Azem's. If you say you belong to him, people will give you the benefit of the doubt for any and all outlandish behavior. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hythlodaeus: Aye, that I could... As you know, Emet-Selch and I can discern the color of souls. By the same token, we can also see aether quite keenly, and from great distances. With this skill, I could readily locate Hermes, but I felt that it would be a waste of an opportunity. We're here to perform an assessment, after all. By searching the ordinary way, we stand to gain insight into Elpis and the man in charge of it. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hermes: Quite all right, yes... My apologies for making you worry, Meteion. Both you and...er... Forename Surname, you are called? An intriguing name, somehow reminiscent of a new creation... Thank you for coming after me. As for you, little one, you must be more careful. You may be able to fly, but it doesn't mean you cannot fall and hurt yourself. ... Oh no, I had forgotten all about its fellows! Truly? What a relief... I must thank Emet-Selch and Hythlodaeus when I return to them. But first, with the distractions out of the way... As chief overseer of Elpis, permit me to welcome you to our facility. I hope you will enjoy your time here. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hythlodaeus: While Emet-Selch has been accommodating thus far, he is the one who has business with Hermes. If you wish to attend, you will have to ask his permission. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hermes: My apologies... It has been decided that Emet-Selch and Hythlodaeus will accompany me as I tend to my duties. If you wish to learn more, perhaps you would like to come too? <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hythlodaeus: Oho, you wish to know why Emet-Selch was chosen for the Convocation? I should be glad to share the tale! <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Emet-Selch: Hmmm... If you would accompany us, I suppose you should at least know that much. The Convocation of Fourteen is a governing body that determines myriad policies. Our goal is to ensure that all is right in creation, that our star may know a brighter future. As the name suggests, the council is comprised of fourteen offices, each of which is held by an individual chosen for their surpassing abilities. Depending on the office, one is required to either be an authority in a certain field, or possess skills that would facilitate the performance of their stipulated duties. The former category includes Mitron, specialist in aquatic life; Loghrif, specialist in terrestrial life and husbandry... Halmarut, specialist in fungal and plant life; Emmerololth, specialist in medicine and healing... And Lahabrea, specialist in creation magicks, who has brought forth phantom beings of the highest complexity. As for the latter category, there is Altima, advocate of the arts; Igeyorhm, champion of enlightenment and rhetoric; Pashtarot, preserver of discipline and order... Emet-Selch, keeper of the aetherial realm─or “Underworld” in the vernacular; Fandaniel, pursuer of extant phenomena... And Azem, traveler of the world and counselor to the people. ...What? Should I be revealing such details to you? Don't be silly. Even children know this much, and you would do well to remember it all. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hythlodaeus: Hmmm... Yes, I believe I have a solution. Emet-Selch─may I trouble you to move that charybdis away from its fellows? Somewhere out of sight. Meanwhile, I'd like the rest of you to help me prepare here. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hythlodaeus: Emet-Selch is out of sight? Good. Let's speak of the plan. It's a stroke of genius, really: we have Emet-Selch train the charybdis! Aside from being able to fly untransformed, he can readily see aether currents. And with his adept spellcraft, he can also employ suitable wind magicks to guide the creature along. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hythlodaeus: Don't be! As I mentioned, it would also be for his own sake. With that settled, let's begin at once! Forename─I want you to go to Emet-Selch. Tell him that you have a favor to ask. He will be disinclined to cooperate at first, but you mustn't be discouraged. With our friend, the trick is to be unflaggingly persistent. Off you go, now, and good luck! <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hermes: With apologies to Emet-Selch, but this may be the best approach. Let us work together to win him over! <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hythlodaeus: If I didn't know better, I'd say Emet-Selch is enjoying himself. Not that he'd ever deign to admit it. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hythlodaeus: Emet-Selch and I will search the area for good measure. Just to make sure the lykaon did not escape. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hythlodaeus: Would it be possible for us to attend the discussion? That Emet-Selch may better carry out his duties. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hermes: An all-too-brief interlude, perhaps, but it is time I attend to my next task. As Emet-Selch and Hythlodaeus are aware, we reached a verdict regarding the fate of the lykaones. Seven were created for observation... ...And all seven must be unmade. Doros has followed the correct protocols, and, as chief overseer, I can find no fault in his judgment. The lykaones would disrupt the natural order, ravaging and consuming other species until they themselves starve and perish. They cannot be released into the wild, and they cannot be allowed to remain here in Elpis. I intend to petition the Bureau of the Architect to have the concept preserved as a restricted-purpose hazardous life-form. Hythlodaeus has pledged to support me in this endeavor. Yet whatever the bureau decides, the existing lykaones have served their purpose... Doros has already isolated the creatures, and is preparing to carry out the necessary measures. I will join him forthwith. It is my duty to witness the...conclusion...to this study. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hythlodaeus: I will render assistance to Emet-Selch, unneeded though it is. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hythlodaeus: The Azems, both mentor and student, are a force to be reckoned with. I find them a delight, personally, but they have a habit of making Emet-Selch look as if he bit down on a sour grape. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hythlodaeus: The Azems, both mentor and student, are a force to be reckoned with. I find them a delight, personally, but they have a habit of making Emet-Selch look as if he bit down on a sour grape. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hythlodaeus: Furthermore, we've confirmed that his studies into dynamis, as well as his creation of Meteion, were entirely private pursuits. No one else we spoke with appeared to possess the chief's depth of knowledge on the subject, and neither did we hear any tales of stolen research. Which means that if Hermes himself harbors no desire to bring down an apocalypse, then he might be recruited to help prevent one... ...Or so sayeth the illustrious Emet-Selch. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Emet-Selch: But as Emet-Selch, I have a duty to examine any potential threat to our existence. No matter how ludicrous or personally offensive I may find it. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Venat: How lovely─our merry duo has become a quartet. Past disagreements are no reason to reject collaboration in the here and now. I commend Emet-Selch for his practicality. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Venat: How lovely─our merry duo has become a quartet. Past disagreements are no reason to reject collaboration in the here and now. I commend Emet-Selch for his practicality. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hythlodaeus: Someone needs to go into the Hungering Gardens to speak with Hermes, and it seems Emet-Selch has nominated you for the task! <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hermes: Forename, what are you doing here! I thought you were keeping Hythlodaeus and Emet-Selch company? ...An “important matter.” And unrelated to my decision on Fandaniel, you say? Then, yes, I will come. As soon as my work here is finished. It will not be long, I promise, but you should really wait outside the garden with the others. This is no place for idle exploration. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hythlodaeus: You spoke with Hermes, then? ...And were briefly entangled with the denizens of the Hungering Gardens as well, I see─or should I say, smell. I cannot speak for certain Convocation members, but I for one am impressed with your fortitude! Well done indeed! Now that you've convinced Hermes to confer with us, let us pray that things will soon take a turn for the better. For as fascinating as it would be to meet the Emet-Selch who would recreate Amaurot in the depths of the ocean, I think it best for all concerned if such tragic events never came to pass. Be it in our future or your past─assuming yours is not truly written in stone. Naive hope that that is... <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hythlodaeus: Correct me if I'm wrong, but Meteion renders herself invisible by matching her aetheric density to that of her surroundings, does she not? If so, could we not then disrupt her concealment with a surfeit of aether? Much how Emet-Selch solidified your presence when first we met you! <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hythlodaeus: Then we have our plan. Forename and Emet-Selch will be our tracker and trapper respectively, while we others predict and obstruct Meteion's avenues of escape. Emet-Selch and I will keep an eye on each other's aether to help coordinate our efforts. Let us be about it! <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hythlodaeus: I feel better about my lack of prowess already! And you, Emet-Selch, can impress us with your arcane majesty. You lob potent spells as easily as breathing, but can also channel that power in a protective manner if you so choose, yes? <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hythlodaeus: I said that Hermes was likely perched somewhere at the highest point of the facility, but reaching him will be no mean feat. To put it simply, Ktisis Hyperboreia contains a multitude of vast spaces linked together at the seams, meaning the interior is far more massive than even this grand structure might otherwise suggest. But even a colossal facility filled top to bottom with savage creations will not stop you─not with Venat and Emet-Selch at your side. And I will be there too, of course, cheering you on! <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Venat: Forename, listen to me. Our duty now is not to denounce Hermes for his misguided determination, or to convince Emet-Selch and Hythlodaeus that they have been deceived. No, we must instead ensure that the experiences Hermes sought to expunge are preserved. What remains in our memories alone will be our weapon against the Final Days. You must fight this battle in your age, and I in mine... Come, let us walk together once more. I will see you to the doors of Propylaion. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Alisaie: Emet-Selch called us incomplete. “Pitiful creatures,” he said, and maybe we are. Pain, grief, fear... They walk with us wherever we go. But we proved to him that we deserve to live, and we'll prove it to Hydaelyn, Meteion...to the universe itself, if we must! <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Y'shtola: To go and see all those places and more... Emet-Selch has given you quite a task. Suffice it to say, I should be glad to assist you. Once we've returned together triumphant, of course. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Alphinaud: Emet-Selch and Hythlodaeus created these flowers from our hopes. If so, mine and Alisaie's shall live on here... The hope that you will find happiness at journey's end. So let us go, Forename, and see this tale to its conclusion! <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Y'shtola: As Alphinaud says, everyone's resolve is beyond doubt. Yet ere we set forth, there is a thought to which I must give voice. While you were in Elpis, I understand that people assumed you were a familiar. In contrast, those phantoms we encountered in the recreated Amaurot regarded us as children. As people, albeit naive and immature. The discrepancy, I posit, is a reflection of their creator's perspective. Having spent eons among sundered men, perhaps he came to acknowledge us, even if only subconsciously. With Emet-Selch gone, we may never learn the truth. But I will not suffer this and countless other mysteries to go unsolved. Our journey will not end this day. <|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Y'shtola: Ah, my apologies. I forget that not all of us spend our days sequestered in dusty archives. The Thirteenth is a reflection of the Source that was drowned in a flood of Darkness. In Emet-Selch's own words, this tragedy was a result of the Ascians' attempts to force a Rejoining. They erred in their haste, and made of that world a “useless void.” You remember Unukalhai, the unusual child we met during our troubles with the Warring Triad? He explained the fate of the Thirteenth thus: The champions of that ill-fated world used the stone known as “auracite” to contain the power of primals. But those selfsame heroes were gradually corrupted by the auracite's bleeding energies, transforming into fiends with an endless hunger for aether. By the time anyone thought to oppose them, Light's strength had grown too feeble...and the balance of the Thirteenth tipped into eternal Darkness. And what of your own experience? Will you tell us of what you observed during NOAH's expedition? I can picture it now... The sunless, stygian expanse, infested with legions of aether-starved monstrosities. A void in every sense of the word. <|endoftext|>
