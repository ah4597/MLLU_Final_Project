Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one.
Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then.
Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example...  Oculus Reparo.  That's better, isn't it? Holy Cricket, you're Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?
Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon.  You've got dirt, on your nose, by the way, did you know? Just there.
It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.
Oh, no. Okay, relax.
Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?
I've read about those. When the smoke turns red,  it means you've forgotten something.
Up. Up. Up. Up.
Harry, no way! You heard what Madam Hooch said! Besides, you don't even know how to fly.  What an idiot.
You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood.
The staircases change, remember?
We're not supposed to be here. This is the 3rd floor. It's forbidden.
Oh, move over!  Alohomora.  Get in.
Standard book of spells, Chapter 7.
Filch is gone.
It was locked.
You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?
It was standing on a trap door. Which means it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something.
That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed... or worse, expelled!
Stop, stop, stop. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, you're saying it wrong. It's Levi-o-sa, not Leviosar.
Wingardium Leviosa.
Help! Help!
Ahhh! Help!
Swish and flick!
Is it...dead?
It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.
I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...I'd probably be dead.
Ron's right, Harry. You're gonna need your strength today.
Blood?
But why would anyone go near that dog?
So you're saying...
Bit early for mail, isn't it?
It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!
Leave it to me.
Lacarnum Inflamarae.
Whoo-hoo!
That thing has a name?
Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a spell when I see one. I've read all about them. You've got to keep eye contact and Snape wasn't blinking.
I don't know.
That's totally barbaric!
See you haven't.
Good, you can help Harry, then. He's going to go and look in the library for information on Nicholas Flamel.
Not in the restricted section. Happy Christmas.
Look at you playing with your cards. Pathetic! We've got final exams coming up soon.
All right, what are the three most crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?
And what, may I ask, do you plan to do if this comes up in the final exam?
No, you won't! Besides, according to Professor McGonagall, we're to be given special quills bewitched with an anti-cheating spell.
Follow me!
I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.
Of course! Here it is!  "Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!"
Honestly, don't you two read? "The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal."
It means you'll never die.
"The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!" That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. That's what's under the trapdoor...the Philosopher's Stone!
We know about the Philosopher's Stone!
Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments.
Is that...a dragon?
Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind.
Harry!
You mean You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?
Hang on a minute.  We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared? Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore's around, Harry, you're safe. As long as Dumbledore's around, you can't be touched.
I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable.
It's happened before.
What is it?
And with Dumbledore gone
Uh...we were just...
Now what do we do?
Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this... Petrificus Totalus.
Sorry.
Ow! You stood on my foot!
Alohomora.
The harp. It stopped playing.
Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster.
Just relax!
Do what I say. Trust me.
Are you okay?
He's not relaxing, is he?
We've got to do something!
Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology.
Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare,  it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight!  Lumos Solem!
What is that?
Curious. I've never seen birds like these.
What's this all about?
Ugh! What're we going to do? There must be 1000 keys up there!
What's wrong, Harry?
I don't like this. I don't like this at all.
Now what do we do?
What happens now?
Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?
What is it?
No, Ron, you can't!  There must be another way!
You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard, you really are.
Me? Books and cleverness? There are more important things. Friendship, and bravery. And Harry, just be careful.
Never better.
We're tied with Slytherin!
Come on, Harry.
Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?
Harry! Hagrid!
Oh, it's so good to see you!
What did you do to your glasses? Oculus reparo.
Ok! Bye!
Come on! Everyone's been so worried.
Fear of a name only increase fear of the thing itself.
Mandrake, or Mandragora, is used to return those who have been Petrified to their original state. It's also quite dangerous. The Mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.
Get off me!
Immobulus!
At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got it on pure talent.
You okay, Ron? Say something!
He called me a Mudblood.
It means dirty blood.â Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born. Someone with non-magic parents. Someone like me. It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.
Harry!
Voice? What voice?
Harry, wait! Not so fast!
The Chamber of Secrets has been opened enemies the heir beware.' It's written in blood.
That's why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor. We'd just found him when he said
It's a bit strange, isn't it?
You hear this voice, a voice only you can hear, and then Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified. It's just strange.
No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign.
Professor, I was wondering if you could tell us aboutthe Chamber of Secrets?
Muggle-borns.
Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?
Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are.
The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?
If you're talking about Malfoy.
I heard him. But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?
Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way. Mind you, it would be difficult. Not to mention, we would be breaking about fifty school rules. And, it'll be dangerous. Very dangerous.
Here it is. 'The Polyjuice Potion.'  'Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another.'
Yes.
Exactly. But it's tricky. I've never seen a more complicated potion.
A month.
I know. But it's the only plan we've got.
No! Even with a proper wand it's too risky. You could hit Harry!
Let's go.
Finite incantatem!
Are you okay?
You will be able to, won't you?
Again? You mean the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?
Maybe. We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.
Heh No. No one ever comes in here.
Moaning Myrtle.
Moaning Myrtle.
She's a little sensitive.
Do you think he's all right?
Oh!
You can talk to snakes.
No, they can't. It's not a very common gift, Harry. This is bad.
I don't know, Harry, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on, or something. Harry, listen to me. There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent. Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He could talk to snakes, too.
He lived a thousand years ago; for all we know, you could be.
Everything's set. We just need a bit of who you're changing into.
We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy.
I've got it all worked out. I filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. Simple, but powerful. Now, once they're asleep hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs, and put on their uniforms.
I've already got mine. Millicent Bulstrodeâ Slytherin- I got this off her robes. I'm going to go check on the Polyjuice Potion. Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle find these.
We'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves Add the hairs.
Cheers!
Me too.
I- I don't think I'm going. You go on without me!
Just go. You're wasting time!
Go away!
Do you remember me telling you that the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations? It was cat's hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes. Look at my face.
It can't be Hagrid. It just can't be.
Look. Hagrid's our friend. Why don't we just go and ask him about it?
No!
It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody else knows our password- unless it wasn't a student.
Thanks, Sir Nicholas!
It's good to be back! Congratulations! I can't believe you solved it!
Thanks.
Oh, no!
It's a cat, Ronald. What do you expect? It's in his nature.
That's rich... coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush. Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy.
Harry.
You know the Egyptians used to worship cats?
Good morning, Mr. Weasley.
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny. Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
Come on. Everywhere else is full.
Professor R.J. Lupin.
It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
Seems to be. Why?
But they'll catch Black, won't they? I mean, everyone's looking for him.
Why are we stopping? We can't be there yet.
Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.
Harry. Harry, are you all right?
No one was screaming, Harry.
Of course. That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.
Just forget it.
What a load of rubbish.
Me? I've been here all this time.
Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline. Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject.
A fair few.
Don't be silly Ron. How could anyone be in two classes at once? Broaden your minds. Use your Inner Eye to see the future!.
I think they're funny.
Just ignore him.
Hagrid! He has to be taken to the hospital.
Yeah but I heard Draco's father's furious. We haven't heard the end of this.
Dufftown? That's not far from here.
No one knows.
Boggarts are shape-shifters. They take the shape of whatever a particular person fears the most. That's what makes them so...
It's not funny, Ron.
But sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks. We're not meant to start that for weeks.
Please, sir. An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal. A werewolf has no choice. With each full moon, when he transforms, he no longer remembers who he is. He'd kill his best friend if he crossed his path. Furthermore, the werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.
Go, Harry! Go, Harry!
