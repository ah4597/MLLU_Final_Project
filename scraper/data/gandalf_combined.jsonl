{"prompt":"", "completion":"The process had begun in the writing of _The Hobbit,_ in which there were already some references to the older matter: Elrond, Gondolin, the High-elves, and the orcs, as well as glimpses that had arisen unbidden of things higher or deeper or darker than its surface: Durin, Moria, Gandalf, the Necromancer, the Ring."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"As is told in The Hobbit, there came one day to Bilbo's door the great Wizard, Gandalf the Grey, and thirteen dwarves with him: none other, indeed, than Thorin Oakenshield, descendant of kings, and his twelve companions in exile."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf, however, disbelieved Bilbo's first story, as soon as he heard it, and he continued to be very curious about the ring."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"That also Gandalf thought strange and suspicious; but he did not discover the truth in this point for many more years, as will be seen in this book."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"After his return to his home he never spoke of it again to anyone, save Gandalf and Frodo; and no one else in the Shire knew of its existence, or so he believed."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"And look at the outlandish folk that visit him: dwarves coming at night, and that old wandering conjuror, Gandalf, and all."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"That was Gandalf's mark, of course, and the old man was Gandalf the Wizard, whose fame in the Shire was due mainly to his skill with fires, smokes, and lights."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Inside Bag End, Bilbo and Gandalf were sitting at the open window of a small room looking out west on to the garden."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"From the time of Gandalf's arrival he remained hidden from view."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"The fireworks were by Gandalf: they were not only brought by him, but designed and made by him; and the special effects, set pieces, and flights of rockets were let off by him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"And there was also one last surprise, in honour of Bilbo, and it startled the hobbits exceedingly, as Gandalf intended."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"The invitations were limited to twelve dozen (a number also called by the hobbits one Gross, though the word was not considered proper to use of people); and the guests were selected from all the families to which Bilbo and Frodo were related, with the addition of a few special unrelated friends (such as Gandalf)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"At that moment the door opened and Gandalf came quickly in."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"I want to see mountains again, Gandalf, _mountains,_ and then find somewhere where I can _rest._ In peace and quiet, without a lot of relatives prying around, and a string of confounded visitors hanging on the bell."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf looked again very hard at Bilbo, and there was a gleam in his eyes."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'I don't know what has come over you, Gandalf,' he said."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'Indeed it would take away the only point I ever saw in the affair,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf remained for a while staring after him into the darkness."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"I think really he preferred slipping off quietly in the end,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"There were rumours of strange things happening in the world outside; and as Gandalf had not at that time appeared or sent any message for several years, Frodo gathered all the news he could."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"It was just at this time that Gandalf reappeared after his long absence."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'So do you,' Frodo replied; but secretly he thought that Gandalf looked older and more careworn."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf was thinking of a spring, nearly eighty years before, when Bilbo had run out of Bag End without a handkerchief."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Even in the light of morning he felt the dark shadow of the tidings that Gandalf had brought."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'Last night you began to tell me strange things about my ring, Gandalf,' he said."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'Bilbo knew no more than he told you, I am sure,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'To tell you the truth,' replied Gandalf, 'I believe that hitherto  _hitherto,_mark you  he has entirely overlooked the existence of hobbits."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"It felt suddenly very heavy, as if either it or Frodo himself was in some way reluctant for Gandalf to touch it."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Frodo gave a cry and groped for the tongs; but Gandalf held him back."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"After a while Gandalf got up, closed the shutters outside the window, and drew the curtains."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'So do I,' said Gandalf, 'and so do all who live to see such times."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'You ought to begin to understand, Frodo, after all you have heard,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'I saw him there,' answered Gandalf, 'but before that he had wandered far, following Bilbo's trail."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"He weighed the Ring in his hand, hesitating, and forcing himself to remember all that Gandalf had told him; and then with an effort of will he made a movement, as if to cast it away  but he found that he had put it back in his pocket."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf sat down again and puffed at his pipe, as if lost in thought."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'Whatever it may do, it will be slow, slow to evil, if you keep it with that purpose,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"He did not tell Gandalf, but as he was speaking a great desire to follow Bilbo flamed up in his heart  to follow Bilbo, and even perhaps to find him again."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"If you don't, if you even breathe a word of what you've heard here, then I hope Gandalf will turn you into a spotted toad and fill the garden full of grass-snakes.'"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"But so firmly fixed had the notion of the immeasurable wealth of the Bagginses of Bag End become that most found this hard to believe, harder than any other reason or unreason that their fancy could suggest: to most it suggested a dark and yet unrevealed plot by Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"At first Frodo was a good deal disturbed, and wondered often what Gandalf could have heard; but his uneasiness wore off, and in the fine weather he forgot his troubles for a while."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Autumn was well under way before Frodo began to worry about Gandalf again."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"The next day Frodo became really anxious, and kept a constant look-out for Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"The four younger hobbits were, however, in high spirits, and the party soon became very cheerful in spite of Gandalf's absence."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Frodo was restless and anxious, listening in vain for a sound of Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"After that, if Gandalf wanted him urgently, he would go to Crickhollow, and might even get there first."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"He half expected to see Gandalf come striding up through the dusk."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'I wonder if that is Gandalf coming after us,' said Frodo; but even as he said it, he had a feeling that it was not so, and a sudden desire to hide from the view of the rider came over him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"And if it is Gandalf,' he added as an afterthought, 'we can give him a little surprise, to pay him out for being so late."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'It is,' said Frodo; 'but I thought my going was a secret known only to Gandalf and my faithful Sam.'"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"I think you should now go at once, without delay; and if Gandalf does not come before you set out, then I also advise this: do not go alone."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"If I take your advice I may not see Gandalf for a long while, and I ought to know what is the danger that pursues me.'"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"You are not a very easy nut to crack, and Gandalf is worse."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"But I meant no wrong to you, Mr. Frodo, nor to Mr. Gandalf for that matter."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"I could see that even Gildor was disturbed when he heard that Gandalf had never appeared."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Still, I am very glad someone is stopping behind, who can tell Gandalf what you have done, when he turns up, as I am sure he will before long.'"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'We could not have left any message behind for Gandalf otherwise."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"But if Fatty is willing to hold the fort, and I can be sure of Gandalf knowing the way we have gone, that decides me."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'Tell Gandalf to hurry along the East Road: we shall soon be back on it and going as fast as we can.'"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Indeed so much did Tom know, and so cunning was his questioning, that Frodo found himself telling him more about Bilbo and his own hopes and fears than he had told before even to Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"He was perhaps a trifle annoyed with Tom for seeming to make so light of what even Gandalf thought so perilously important."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Frodo was neither very fat nor very timid; indeed, though he did not know it, Bilbo (and Gandalf) had thought him the best hobbit in the Shire."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf would admit that there had been nothing else he could do."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"And I'm mortal afraid of what Gandalf will say, if harm comes of it."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Frodo turned and looked at him thoughtfully, wondering about Gandalf's second postscript."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'Why didn't you tell me that you were Gandalf's friend at once?'"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'They are  at first sight at any rate,' laughed Pippin with sudden relief after reading Gandalf's letter."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'How do we know you are the Strider that Gandalf speaks about?'"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"But how did you know that they were in Gandalf's letter, if you have never seen it?'"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"The tidings had gone far and wide that Gandalf was missing and the horsemen had been seen."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'Do you think the Black Riders have anything to do with it  with Gandalf's absence, I mean?'"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf is greater than you Shire-folk know  as a rule you can only see his jokes and toys."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Merry was still reading and pondering Gandalf's letter when Strider and Nob returned."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"If Gandalf was anywhere about, there was no sign of him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'It might be a sign left by Gandalf, though one cannot be sure."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'I wonder if old Gandalf has been here,' he said to Pippin."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'I was very anxious to find some sign of Gandalf; but it was a mistake for three of us to go up and stand there so long."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'I know only the little that Gandalf has told me,' said Frodo slowly."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"He did not forget the Barrow, nor the message of Gandalf; but something seemed to be compelling him to disregard all warnings, and he longed to yield."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Your Frodo is made of sterner stuff than I had guessed, though Gandalf hinted that it might prove so."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"If Gandalf ever came here, then he must have been forced to ride away, and he will not return."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"These must be the very three that were caught by Gandalf, quarrelling over the right way to cook thirteen dwarves and one hobbit.'"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"They were probably following the very track that Gandalf, Bilbo, and the dwarves had used many years before."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"They said that the Nine were abroad, and that you were astray bearing a great burden without guidance, for Gandalf had not returned."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"While he was thinking of all these things and trying in vain to bring his memory down to his arriving in Rivendell, there was a long silence, broken only by the soft puffs of Gandalf's pipe, as he blew white smoke-rings out of the window."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'You have talked long in your sleep, Frodo,' said Gandalf gently, 'and it has not been hard for me to read your mind and memory."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'I was delayed,' said Gandalf, `and that nearly proved our ruin."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'You will soon hear all you wish to know,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`You don't know much even about them, if you think old Barliman is stupid,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'You have talked and reckoned more than is good for you,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'Yes, fortune or fate have helped you,' said Gandalf, `not to mention courage."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf moved his chair to the bedside, and took a good look at Frodo."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf looked quickly at Frodo, but he had shut his eyes."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`Well, there are many reasons why they should,' said Gandalf, smiling."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf asked me to come and see if you were ready to come down, and I thought he was joking.'"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`Gandalf has been saying many cheerful things like that,' said Pippin."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`As soon as Gandalf reported that you were recovered, the preparations began.'"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Elrond, as was his custom, sat in a great chair at the end of the long table upon the dais; and next to him on the one side sat Glorfindel, on the other side sat Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Frodo looked at them in wonder, for he had never before seen Elrond, of whom so many tales spoke; and as they sat upon his right hand and his left, Glorfindel, and even Gandalf, whom he thought he knew so well, were revealed as lords of dignity and power."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf was shorter in stature than the other two; but his long white hair, his sweeping silver beard, and his broad shoulders, made him look like some wise king of ancient legend."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"But perhaps I should not inquire too closely, since Elrond and Gandalf do not seem disposed to talk of this?'"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"It is a pity that Gandalf did not find out more sooner."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"I have thought several times of going back to Hobbiton for it; but I am getting old, and they would not let me: Gandalf and Elrond, I mean."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`You can trot off and tell Gandalf that he has gone to bed."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"On a seat cut in the stone beside a turn in the path they came upon Gandalf and Bilbo deep in talk."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`That is the warning bell for the Council of Elrond,' cried Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`Here,' said Elrond, turning to Gandalf, `is Boromir, a man from the South."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"I still want to know a good deal, especially about Gandalf.'"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"But these things it is the part of Gandalf to make clear; and I call upon him last, for it is the place of honour, and in all this matter he has been the chief.'"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`Some, Galdor,' said Gandalf, `would think the tidings of Glóin, and the pursuit of Frodo, proof enough that the halfling's trove is a thing of great worth to the Enemy."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf fell silent, gazing eastward from the porch to the far peaks of the Misty Mountains, at whose great roots the peril of the world had so long lain hidden."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`From the first my heart misgave me, against all reason that I knew,' said Gandalf, `and I desired to know how this thing came to Gollum, and how long he had possessed it."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"And since it seemed fit that Isildur's heir should labour to repair Isildur's fault, I went with Gandalf on the long and hopeless search.'"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Then Gandalf told how they had explored the whole length of Wilderland, down even to the Mountains of Shadow and the fences of Mordor."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`But in that time also he made this scroll,' said Gandalf; `and that is not remembered in Gondor, it would seem."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"For my part I hope never to look upon him again; but Gandalf came and endured long speech with him.'"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`Never before has any voice dared to utter the words of that tongue in Imladris, Gandalf the Grey,' said Elrond, as the shadow passed and the company breathed once more."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`And let us hope that none will ever speak it here again,' answered Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"We guarded this creature day and night, at Gandalf's bidding, much though we wearied of the task."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"But Gandalf bade us hope still for his cure, and we had not the heart to keep him ever in dungeons under the earth, where he would fall back into his old black thoughts.'"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Tell them to bring news of anything that bears on this matter to Saruman and Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"` \"So you have come, Gandalf,\" he said to me gravely; but in his eyes there seemed to be a white light, as if a cold laughter was in his heart."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"It has seldom been heard of that Gandalf the Grey sought for aid, one so cunning and so wise, wandering about the lands, and concerning himself in every business, whether it belongs to him or not.\""}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"And here you will stay, Gandalf the Grey, and rest from journeys."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Or until it is found in your despite, and the Ruler has time to turn to lighter matters: to devise, say, a fitting reward for the hindrance and insolence of Gandalf the Grey.\""}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`Then it was late in coming,' said Gandalf, 'as you will see."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf the Grey caught like a fly in a spider's treacherous web!"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"But such a thing has not happened before, that Gandalf broke tryst and did not come when he promised."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`But Gandalf has revealed to us that we cannot destroy it by any craft that we here possess,' said Elrond."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"said Gandalf, looking in through the window, which was near the ground."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"So great was Frodo's delight at this announcement that Gandalf left the window-sill, where he had been sitting, and took off his hat and bowed."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'Eight out of the Nine are accounted for at least,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"With you and your faithful servant, Gandalf will go; for this shall be his great task, and maybe the end of his labours."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Aragorn and Gandalf walked together or sat speaking of their road and the perils they would meet; and they pondered the storied and figured maps and books of lore that were in the house of Elrond."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf bore his staff, but girt at his side was the elven-sword Glamdring, the mate of Orcrist that lay now upon the breast of Thorin under the Lonely Mountain."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Their farewells had been said in the great hall by the fire, and they were only waiting now for Gandalf, who had not yet come out of the house."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"At that moment Elrond came out with Gandalf, and he called the Company to him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf walked in front, and with him went Aragorn, who knew this land even in the dark."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf stood at Frodo's side and looked out under his hand."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`It is for the Dimrill Dale that we are making,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`May you have joy of the sight, my good dwarf l' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'To the end of the journey  in the end,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`And in that case so is the Redhorn Gate,' said Gandalf; `and how we can get over that without being seen, I cannot imagine."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Frodo overheard these words, and understood that Gandalf and Aragorn were continuing some debate that had begun long before."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'I think no good of our course from beginning to end, as you know well, Gandalf,' answered Aragorn."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"In the late afternoon, while the others were finishing their breakfast, Gandalf and Aragorn went aside together and stood looking at Caradhras."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"When they returned to the Company Gandalf spoke, and then he knew that it had been decided to face the weather and the high pass."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`From signs that we have seen lately,' said Gandalf, 'I fear that the Redhorn Gate may be watched; and also I have doubts of the weather that is coming up behind."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"The dark bent shapes of Gandalf and Aragorn only a pace or two ahead could hardly be seen."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`It matters little who is the enemy, if we cannot beat off his attack; said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`This will be the death of the halflings, Gandalf,' said Boromir."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`Give them this,' said Gandalf, searching in his pack and drawing out a leathern flask."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'I have written _Gandalf is here_ in signs that all can read from Rivendell to the mouths of Anduin.'"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`If Gandalf would go before us with a bright flame, he might melt a path for you,' said Legolas."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`If Elves could fly over mountains, they might fetch the Sun to save us,' answered Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Behind in the narrow but now well-trodden track came Gandalf, leading Bill with Gimli perched among the baggage."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf spared them one more mouthful each of the miruvor of Rivendell."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'We still have our journey and our errand before us,' answered Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`You are right, Frodo,' said Gandalf: `to go back is to admit defeat and face worse defeat to come."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'The road that I speak of leads to the Mines of Moria,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`You speak of what you do not know, when you liken Moria to the stronghold of Sauron,' answered Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"It is not of the Ring, nor of us others that I am thinking now, but of you, Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`I do not wish to go,' he said; `but neither do I wish to refuse the advice of Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf will get votes easier in the light of the morning than in this cold gloom."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`There was a door south-west of Caradhras, some fifteen miles as the crow flies, and maybe twenty as the wolf runs,' answered Gandalf grimly."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Whatever may be in store for old Gandalf, I'll wager it isn't a wolf's belly.'"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf and Aragorn strode forward, but the hill was deserted; the hunting packs had fled."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"In the wavering firelight Gandalf seemed suddenly to grow: he rose up, a great menacing shape like the monument of some ancient king of stone set upon a hill."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`We must reach the doors before sunset,' said Gandalf, 'or I fear we shall not reach them at all."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`I do not know which to hope,' said Boromir grimly: `that Gandalf will find what he seeks, or that coming to the cliff we shall find the gates lost for ever."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"But either Gandalf was astray, or else the land had changed in recent years; for he did not strike the stream where he looked to find it, only a few miles southwards from their start."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"They found the stone steps without difficulty, and Gimli sprang swiftly up them, followed by Gandalf and Frodo."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`There are the Walls of Moria,' said Gandalf, pointing across the water."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`But in any case we cannot take the poor beast into the Mines,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"They hurried forward, for they had still a mile or two to go before they could reach the point on the far shore that Gandalf was making for; and then he had still to find the doors."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf now pressed on at a great pace, and the others followed as quickly as they could."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'I have heard both,' said Gandalf; 'and I will not give judgement now."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'But you can't leave poor old Bill behind in this forsaken place, Mr. Gandalf! '"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'But this Door was not made to be a secret known only to Dwarves,' said Gandalf, coming suddenly to life and turning round."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"At the top, as high as Gandalf could reach, was an arch of interlacing letters in an Elvish character."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`The words are in the elven-tongue of the West of Middle-earth in the Elder Days,' answered Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"The others looked dismayed; only Aragorn, who knew Gandalf well, remained silent and unmoved."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"`Knock on the doors with your head, Peregrin Took,' said Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Again Gandalf approached the wall, and lifting up his arms he spoke in tones of command and rising wrath."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Sam and Frodo were only a few steps up, and Gandalf had just begun to climb, when the groping tentacles writhed across the narrow shore and fingered the cliff-wall and the doors."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"They heard Gandalf go back down the steps and thrust his staff against the doors."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"'I do not know,' answered Gandalf, 'but the arms were all guided by one purpose."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"After they had eaten, Gandalf gave them each a third sip of the miruvor of Rivendell."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Often the wizard consulted him at points where the choice of way was doubtful; but it was always Gandalf who had the final word."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"To Gandalf the far-off memories of a journey long before were now of little help, but even in the gloom and despite all windings of the road he knew whither he wished to go, and he did not falter, as long as there was a path that led towards his goal."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"Good morning, Master Gandalf,\" Bilbo returned, raising his pipe in greeting."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Once Gandalf was on his way with a promise to return for dinner, Bilbo calmly stood up and walked back into his home, shut the door and locked it, and then proceeded to have a minor break down."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"And to have to look into the face of his oldest and dearest friend and lie… Bilbo wasn't sure how he was going to face the rest of his (dead) companions if he couldn't even face Gandalf for five minutes."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"You seem confused, Master Gandalf,\" he commented, leaning back against the chair he had been dragged to after being at the bottom of a Dwarven pancake."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Simply the ponderings of an old man,\" Gandalf dismissed just as he expected him to."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"He could feel Gandalf staring at him with his ancient eyes, and knew that there would be a comment to soon follow."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf slowly rose to his feet and gave the others a knowing look."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Every second seemed to turn into an hour as Gandalf stood and headed to the front door with the Dwarves following."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"—grocer than a burglar,\" finished the king, glancing to his left to raise a brow at Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"I thought you might like to hear them,\" Gandalf replied slowly."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf stared down at him; his gray eyes gleaming from beneath his heavy brows."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"I do not have the skills to find it, but there are others in Middle Earth who can,\" he heard Gandalf comment as he leaned over the table."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"He looked up at the owner of the hand, and found Gandalf staring down at him with pursed lips."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf smiled while the Dwarves murmured amongst each other and exchanged looks."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"As Balin went about pulling out the contract, Bilbo found himself under the intense gaze of Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"The lives of those he held were too important for him to risk even to Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"—it is Gandalf who tells him of the fates of Balin, Óin and Ori."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"He noticed Gandalf had been watching him with that same look he used to (and eventually would again) give Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took whenever they got too close to the fireworks."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"That was fine because it gave him a chance to focus on another problem: Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"He had enough that he had to deal with, and having Gandalf against him did not help."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf stared at him silently for a moment before slowly nodding."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf's eyes widened as he took in the meaning of his words."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf paused and stared at the skeletal remains of the shack with furrowed brows."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"We would be most welcome by Lord Elrond—\" Gandalf was trying to explain with obvious impatience, and mounting anger."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf's lips became pinched and he tugged his hat down further over his eyes."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"I have seen no such skills in battle,\" he interrupted, cutting the king off much in the same manner he had done earlier to Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"And, Gandalf, you should not be wandering about alone considering we've been hearing wargs howling for the past few nights."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"So far everything had stayed true to his expectations—they had found the troll cave, discovered the swords, buried the chest of treasure, and he even got Sting from Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Those roles were meant to be filled by people like Thorin and Gandalf and Frodo."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf demanded of the king, and the two soon erupted into an argument."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Another was ambushed by the others; Thorin neatly beheading the Orc before taking out the Warg with the aid of Gandalf, Balin and Glóin."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"He stood scowling next to Gandalf as the wizard spoke to a very familiar Elf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf was clearly trying to convince the king to head to Rivendell for rest and aid in reading the map."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Eventually he gave a grudging nod that won a loud sigh from Gandalf, and a small smirk from the Elf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"When dinner ended, Bilbo watched Thorin leave with Elrond, Gandalf, and Balin while the rest of the Company returned to their rooms."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"He also knew that soon the White Council would gather to question Gandalf about their Company, and Saruman—the bloody traitor—would attempt to stop them."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"He could only hope that Gandalf was tricky enough to stall for time as they made their escape."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"If Gandalf did not confront the Necromancer, then who would stop him?"}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Bilbo did not know what tricks Gandalf had to use this time around in order to distract the White Council, but he was grateful the wizard was so canny."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"The Dwarf really had nothing on Gandalf when the wizard was angry."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"A good question, Master Baggins,\" Gandalf said, speaking up for the first time."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"That someone would pay a price for his head,\" Gandalf answered for the king."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Below them Gandalf, Thorin, Dwalin and Dori took their places in the bushes around the camp."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf, Thorin, Dwalin and Dori finally revealed themselves and attacked the nearest Orc to them."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf led them through the dark forest while the others helped the wounded as they begun the task of walking down the mountain."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Dwalin was polishing his axe while Gandalf smoked his pipe and seemed to study the night sky above."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"He stayed awake long enough to watch Dori and Gandalf finally fall asleep, and for Dwalin to switch with Thorin."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Thorin led them with Gandalf by his side while Fíli, Nori, and Bofur were ordered to walk in the middle as they were still healing."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"When Bilbo can't go any further,\" Gandalf answered, lighting up his pipe."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Later, after dinner was finished and the few bedrolls set out, Bilbo was surprised to find himself in the company of Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"It was partly his own fault since he had been preoccupied with keeping track of events and Dwarfs, but he also had a feeling that Gandalf had been avoiding him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"Yes, I've noticed your affection and protective nature over the others,\" admitted Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"He thought his explanation would satisfy Gandalf, but all it did was make his face fall and his eyes grow dark."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf was his oldest and dearest friend even if the wizard did not know him as well yet."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf stared at him for a long while with his ancient eyes."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Eventually Gandalf released a long and deep sigh that made his shoulders slump."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"He did not know what Gandalf thought of his words, but the wizard smiled at him like he had an idea of what he meant."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"It was there that Gandalf finally Mentioned Beorn and suggested that they stop there to ask for supplies and rest."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"I have not met the Man myself, but I am told he can speak the language of beasts,\" replied Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Maybe less if we are not followed by Orcs and Wargs,\" Gandalf grumbled, casting a glare to the mountains behind them."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"He had thought it was a Hobbit custom at first, but Gandalf had assured him it was merely a Bilbo one."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"The last time around Gandalf had dragged him along first while bidding the rest to wait before entering."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"It might overwhelm him if we all come trotting in at once,\" Gandalf mused, rubbing his staff in thought."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"A practical idea, Master Baggins,\" Gandalf agreed, his gray eyes lighting up."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"They skirted around until they finally came to a tall and broad wooden gate that Gandalf boldly pushed open."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"They have gone to tell him of our arrival,\" commented Gandalf, looking amused."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Beorn was taller than Gandalf, as thickly muscled as Dwalin, and sported more hair than Glóin."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf moved forward first and tipped his hat politely to the giant."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"He heard Gandalf groan beside him, and imagined that his father was probably rolling in his grave at his terrible manners."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"He looked over the rest of the Company before glancing back to Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"The Dwarves begun to mutter to each other and Gandalf frowned."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"He listened as the Dwarfs questioned why and grumbled at the answer they received, and then ignored them as Gandalf began to lecture them all."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"There is one more thing you should all know,\" added Gandalf, clearing this throat."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf had left them the last time around as well, but he had thought it had been because of the Necromancer."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"I wish I could ask him but it would likely make him suspicious, he thought as he listened to Gandalf reassure the others that he would return eventually."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Beorn assured me that they know their way home,\" Gandalf promised as he helped them unload their packs."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"This is where I leave you all now,\" announced Gandalf as he hoisted himself onto his horse."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"He recognized it as the one Gandalf had given Thorin in the beginning of their journey."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Since Gandalf was still gone he turned his attention to the next best healer around: Óin."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Unsurprisingly, it was Gandalf who reached him first with the others trailing behind him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Clearly an error on my part,\" Gandalf agreed with a nod as the others joined them."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Bilbo stepped back and allowed the others to follow after the Dwarf before moving to Gandalf's side."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"The first time around, Gandalf had left them to face off against the Necromancer."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"He did not know what Gandalf had gone off to take care of this time, but whatever it was, it clearly had nothing to do with the Necromancer."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"For all his innocent and foolish persona, Gandalf was as sharp as a blade and rarely missed even the smallest detail."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"Ahh, well, I suppose that makes sense,\" admitted Gandalf, rubbing his fingers against the wood of his staff."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"Do not worry yourself over Mirkwood,\" continued Gandalf, failing to notice his irritation."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf gave him a kind smile and patted his shoulder again."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"To his relief, Gandalf soon lit up the top of his staff and casted a white light over them all."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Bombur was crying silently to himself as Gandalf patted him on the back."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Bilbo ignored the frowns and scowls, and simply gave Gandalf a final nod before he descended into the city for the (second) first time his life."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"the Hobbit wondered, blinking around before realizing that the entire Company and Gandalf were there."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Above them, he could see Gandalf and Kíli running up a flight of stairs; obviously searching for a safe spot for the Dwarf to fire his arrows."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"As he drew closer, he looked up to where Gandalf and Kíli had finally come to an open ledge that stood in perfect range of the dragon."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"He's right,\" agreed Balin, joining in on the conversation with Óin and Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Balin and Gandalf had wandered off to make plans to return to Lake-town at dawn while Fíli had rejoined the others in their celebration."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"Gandalf says he put some sort of spell on it,\" explained Dwalin, crossing his arms over his broad chest."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Balin and Gandalf had still not returned but he was not worried."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Everyone was working—even Gandalf, to his surprise—and no one idled around."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"—for a moment he thinks Thorin will ignore Gandalf and simply drop him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Behind him trailed Balin, Gandalf, and Óin; all of them frowning and looking far too serious for Bilbo's comfort."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"There he found Gandalf and Balin arguing with a familiar Elvenking while Óin stood off to the side watching."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf stood between the two and looked close to smacking them both with his staff."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Balin relaxed as Gandalf groaned and Thranduil pulled his lips back in the slightest hint of a snarl."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"thundered Gandalf, the air crackling around him with tightly controlled power."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Stop riling him up,\" advised Gandalf, giving the king a stink eye."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"Like your grandfather,\" finished Gandalf, his gray eyes as hard and unflinching as stone."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"You won't be speaking for the next few years,\" translated Gandalf because he secretly enjoyed causing trouble."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"At his side, Gandalf watched as well with hard, gray eyes; reading something into the exile of the Men that he could only guess at."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"He is ignoring us all and has holed himself up in one of the rooms,\" Gandalf replied, scowling at the fading backs of Bard and his Men."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Since Dáin's announcement of Azog, Thorin had called a meeting between himself, Dáin, Balin, and Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"The loud noise startled Bilbo into jumping to his feet in alarm, only to find Gandalf storming out with a string of curses."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"They failed to notice the Hobbit in the corner as they walked off after Gandalf; whispering to each other and making dramatic hand gestures."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"My ears hurt from listening to Gandalf yell,\" the Dwarf revealed, glancing down to where their bodies touched before looking back to Bilbo's face."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf and Thorin were nowhere to be seen and he was grateful for that."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"When Gandalf did finally appear, his face was pinched and his nostrils flared with every breath he took."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"Oh good, you didn't kill each other while I was gone,\" Gandalf said in greeting, waltzing over to the group."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"Now, now, I'm sure it's not that horrible,\" Gandalf commented as he stepped into the tent."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"Stop right there, Bilbo Baggins, I don't want to hear another word,\" Gandalf interrupted, his voice turning steely."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf sighed, and ran his large hand through the Hobbit's curls."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf sighed again, and simply kept running his hand through his hair in a soothing gesture."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Through it all Gandalf stayed by his side as he cried out his heart again for the king that he lost once more."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Inside he found Thranduil standing over a table with Gandalf and—surprisingly—Bard."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Master Gandalf here has just explained what you did earlier today…\""}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"That is what I was wondering as well,\" commented Gandalf, raising his bushy brows at Thranduil."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Bard frowned and pulled his shoulders back while Gandalf scowled and looked ready to smack the king with his staff."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Beside him, Gandalf's dark eyes seemed even older in the harsh lines of his face."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Occasionally Gandalf or Bard would find him and would attempt to talk him into resting."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"We were all worried about you after Gandalf took you away."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Ask Gandalf or Bard about it later,\" he replied, not wanting to speak of the events again."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"Gandalf asked me to keep you behind so you would be safe,\" the Elf said as he slowly looked the burglar over, \"but I do not believe that is possible for anyone.\""}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"I will fight in this battle whether Gandalf wants me to or not,\" he replied, raising his chin stubbornly."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf had played mediator between the two sects and had managed to convince Dáin and Thorin to keep their Dwarves stationed before Erebor to meet the Orcs and Goblins head on."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Sometimes he even caught a glimpse of it in Gandalf but it was fleeting and rare."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf said you would be with that damn leaf-eater in the camp!\""}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"Gandalf should have checked with me first before he decided what I would do,\" he retorted sharply, driving Sting into a nearby Goblin that was attempting to cut Glóin's leg off."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Perhaps all the praise Gandalf had given the Dwarf lord was deserved after all."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"He recalled the many tales he read in Rivendell and even the stories that Gandalf used to share with him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"He still wasn't sure how that happened but he blamed Gandalf and his fast talking."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"That was why he ended up sitting at a round table with Gandalf, Thranduil, Bard, Balin and Dáin."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf smiled the same smile that he always wore right before he lit up his fireworks."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Beorn thought to ask Gandalf but the wizard did not seem aware of his Hobbit companion's state."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"He wrote a letter to Gandalf explaining his second chance at life, and thanking him for being his good friend for so many years."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"After he finished his letter to Gandalf, Bilbo wrote a letter to each of the Dwarves that he had come to care for so much."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"As with Gandalf's letter, he explained his second chance and what really happened the first time he joined them on their quest."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"Now tell us why before we drag you off to Gandalf—\""}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"He then told them of Frodo and how he gave the ring to his nephew only to have Gandalf at last discover that it was the One Ring."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Radagast the Brown—he's a wizard like Gandalf—he was supposed to warn us about an evil rising in Dol Guldur, but he never showed up!\""}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"Gandalf later went to investigate Dol Guldur and defeated him the first time, but this time he did not give any indication that anything of that nature happened."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Without them, we have only the Company and perhaps Gandalf to help us face Mordor,\" Balin pointed out, ever the voice of reason."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"I heard from Gandalf that Bilbo took his pet, new mistress, and the scary Elf along with him.\""}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"I'm hoping Gandalf will talk some sense into them if they try."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"It was one of the reasons why he got along so great with Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"He tried his best to ignore the dark fortress as he went about his tasks, but it was very hard as he recalled the stories he heard from Gandalf, and his own haunting dream of Sauron."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Bilbo thought he could live to be Gandalf's age and he would still feel like a gutted fish every time a friend passed away."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"I have a theory but I won't know for sure till Gandalf gets here.\""}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"the Dwarf yelled as he came stomping into the camp with his soldiers and Gandalf."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf didn't look like he agreed with that idea, but didn't protest as the king marched off yelling orders."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf made a sound in his throat that had several nearby Dwarves backing away."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf flashed him a reassuring smile that did nothing to reassure him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"But now, hours later, Olórin—or Gandalf as he went by here because he foolishly thought that having a secret identify would make him seem mysterious—finally stood before him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"We also used Gandalf to intimidate them into moving as quickly as possible."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf says there may be a way to save me, but I'm not sure if it will work,\" he explained."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Behind Radagast, Gandalf and Lord Elrond stood watching the proceedings with vastly different expressions."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf looked like a puffed up hen; angry and protective on behalf of his chick."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"He didn't want to lose the advantage he has now with you alive,\" Gandalf explained calmly."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"We should probably begin soon,\" Gandalf said, eyeing the two like he didn't know if he wanted to encourage the discussion or avoid it."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"Way to make me feel like a meal, Gandalf,\" Bilbo muttered as he stood up."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf said that if Sauron has been leeching off of you all this time, then his darker energies must have been influencing you to some degree,\" the king explained, settling his hand on the back of Bilbo's neck."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Kíli frowned, and then, quick as Gandalf would light his staff, his expression became guarded."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"This book was eventually found by Gandalf the Grey and the Fellowship of the Ring, and handed to Gimli the Dwarf, who brought it back to Erebor."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf was still standing by the fireplace, looking absurdly huge amongst all of Bilbo's things."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"You certainly haven't been coming to chat with me or Radagast then, my dear boy,\" Gandalf said, casually stealing some of Bilbo's fine pipe-weed and packing his pipe."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"I don't spend a great deal of time in one place, as a rule, and so I never stay long in lands where a Dwarf's spirit might linger,\" Gandalf said, stretching out his legs and lighting his pipe."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"All of us who were once servants of the greater powers still have some of our gifts,\" Gandalf said, raising a bushy eyebrow."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"I was not aware you were,\" Thorin snapped back, and Gandalf chuckled."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf blew out another smoke ring, and then fixed Thorin with his piercing blue stare."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"Well, well,\" Gandalf said, his eyes narrowing and his mouth gnawing thoughtfully on his pipe-stem."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Much of the talk came from Gandalf (who was either ignoring the Company or unaware of their presence) and Lord Elrond (the smug, self-satisfied Elven git)."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf hummed in thought and his eyes narrowed under his bushy brows."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"The noise was becoming deafening, and Thorin turned to see Gandalf's eyes lingering on him."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Thorin caught sight of Bilbo's face as Gandalf stepped forward and pledged himself to the young Hobbit's protection."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf was the one who chose Bilbo Baggins, or have you forgotten?\""}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"It was a good thing Gimli had brought his father's flint, as Gandalf disappeared shortly after they had made camp."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"My father said Gandalf comes and goes as he will,\" Gimli said, and smiled at the little Hobbit as the tinder caught."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"It seems that between you and Legolas and Gandalf, I am a mere child.\""}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf emerged, his face drawn into lines of anger and determination."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"\"We do not aim for Minas Tirith, but for Mordor,\" Gandalf said, and he turned to lead them on."}
{"prompt":"", "completion":"Gandalf peered through the swirling flakes, and then bent his head."}
