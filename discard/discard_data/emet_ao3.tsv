	“Emet-Selch, a moment before we continue?” “If it was not approved through the Bureau of the Architect, if no such blueprint exists based on Emet-Selch’s recollection and that of his apprentice, this warrants further Convocation involvement.
	Hades.
	“For all these eternities Emet-Selch and I have labored, tell me, if we could convince her .
	Emet-Selch finally loosens his grip on you, but you don’t try to step away.
	Emet-Selch looks her direction with a knowing smirk, flowers appearing in the simulation lining the route.
	It is a no more than ordinary day when Hades meets the two most aggravating people in the star.
	“You are  stronger  than His hold on your soul, my friend,” Lahabrea insisted and I watched Hades blink, his eyes filling with panic as they exchanged more words, quiet enough that I could not hear.
	“It will,” Emet-Selch stated.
	I would recommend you end that particular streak immediately or tonight’s delights will have to make way for well-deserved punishment instead.” Emet-Selch released her jaw and let his hands wander to her hips.
	Hades watched in delight as she slowly unwound before him.
	You can keep her.” Hades opened his mouth to retort, but the girl continued.
	This is about  your  pleasure.”  He bends down to press his lips against Elidibus’s for a gentle kiss that quickly becomes heated, the Emissary tugging at his restraints again in an attempt to get closer as their tongues battle and teeth nip and bite, until eventually Emet-Selch pulls himself away, panting softly.
	He focused on it, recognising it as Hades.
	I also thought to the reaction I might be able to tease out of Emet-Selch.
	For blinded by his God’s screamed commands, blinded by his rage and grief, Hades did not realise that history was repeating until he descended upon that pathetic, vain reflection of his oldest enemy  (friend)  and  felt  his thinned soul  flare.
	You have so many questions, but ever since that night of Hythlodaeus’ appearance, Hades has seen fit to not let you out of his sight.
	“That’s not good for your health,” Emet points out.
	Hades took in a steadying breath as he stepped across the broken floor, furrowing his brow as the gold began to fade, giving way to fragmentations, fissures among the wall, the ground.
	“It should never have happened,” Says Emet-Selch to your body, as though he can command the marks upon it to disappear, “You should never have been hurt.
	A soft moan in reply as Hades’s mind flitted to fantasies of serving his partners, his ass clenching tight as his thoughts began to blur, his breaths coming in short pants.
	Hades waved a hand carelessly, summoning a platter of tea and treats with barely a thought.
	Emet-Selch moved to the side, playing the defensive.
	Emet-Selch rips off his pristine glove with his teeth and dashes the back of his hand across the Exarch’s face.
	He was embarrassed, Hythlodaeus could tell it even if he did not say it, but everytime that Hades overheard him repeating words that didn’t quite work he would assist the man.
	Emet-Selch had freely admitted that all the Ascians had been tempered by Zodark at his creation.
	Emet-Selch leans a little closer, right into your personal space, and you try your best to not flinch away from him.
	Yet the echo memory of Emet-Selch’s tempting offer to the former mayor did not play.
	“Oh, you’re not serious,” Emet-Selch threw back.
	There is a slight tremor in your movements as you turn to fully face Emet-Selch, a notion churning in the pit of your stomach that you are perhaps making a mistake.
	“I would hardly use the word friend.” Hades scoffs Emet-Selch will tell Azem all about her, probably bring her out to show her.
	Emet-Selch's hands are back on your hips, wandering down, squeezing your ass, and you let out another whimper of need.
	“That’s creepy,” Hades mumbled.
	Hades sighed.
	Hades makes his moves while (Y/N) sleeps.
	“Given my rank in the Convocation, it’s very important that we lead by example,” Hades said, finishing for me.
	I was beginning to miss you,” Hades told quietly.
	“To defeat your enemies, you need the element of surprise on your side,” Hades explained as he, Thancred, and I stood on opposites sides of the arena.
	But neither does it turn out to be quite the ordeal Emet-Selch had so vehemently protested being subjected to.)
	A weaker man might have cowered, but Emet-Selch found himself intrigued.
	Elidibus is already here on the First and now that I have Emet in my care, there’s no telling when he might show up─especially if I’m not there to deter him from picking a fight.” Aestelle said, glancing to Hades for a moment before looking to the twins and G’raha once more.
	Emet-Selch smiles as he watches the determined look on your face, and without ever taking his eyes off you, he rubs the tip of his shoe against your folds, and you nearly crumble.
	Prometheus set the eggs down, "Oh, Hades, Hades, Hades…" Hades snapped his fingers and the carton of eggs leapt off the counter.
	Their dance continued on, and Emet-Selch couldn’t bear to tear his eyes away.
	When I had calmed down, I stood up from Hades’ lap and reached down to help him up as well.
	You thought ancient beings like us incapable of crying?” His lashes slowly lowered and his voice got quieter as Emet continued to speak, “Well, rest assured that if your heart can be broken, then so can mine.” He couldn’t continue to meet her eyes, looking off to the side, voice soft as he tried to keep a rein on his emotions.
	That day, Emet-Selch was reminded of how truly ephemeral a sundered life could be.
	And then Emet-Selch’s mouth settles over G’raha’s cock and sucks.
	“Can you call one of my maids, Hades?
	Emet-Selch, that is.” Though Hythlodaeus couldn’t see it, Aeliana smiled fondly around his pert nipple as her mind’s eye conjured up the associated visuals of a young and studious Emet-Selch.
	You are going to be late for work~” Hythlodaeus smiled in answer to Hades’s indignant glare.
	“Should I surrender this fight, what will become of it all..?” She looked up to the creature, the arcane entity...Hades.
	“Always,” Hades promised, “I’ll chase you wherever you go.” Prometheus was his guiding star, and Hades would follow it endlessly, no matter how many horizons it took him beyond.
	The way his eyes widen ever so slightly and the noise that escapes Emet-Selch cause a heated desire to pool between Cassia’s legs as she slowly pulls back only to do it again.
	“It will be fine, Hades,” she interjected with a small smile and a reassuring nod.
	Emet-Selch looks confused for a moment, and Cassia sighes.
	Honestly, for a man as impatient as he is, Hades certainly loves to take his time when he's in the mood for it.
	Emet-Selch...only spoke the truth.
	As for the two of us, Emet-Selch informed me that he already had somewhere prepared where we could stay until the day of the ball.
	Remember me, Hades.
	I scoffed and Hades raised a brow before looking at me.
	Hades clenched at his chest, leaning his head back to breathe, “It’s…It’s her soul.” Hades’ heart grew cold, stomach turning acidic and vile—he was on the verge of blacking out, but consciousness or no, he could see no aether moving in the form she held.
	Emet-Selch shakes his head with a click of his tongue.
	It's not unreasonable, and however much there  is a whine building in Emet-Selch's throat, it's more for his pitiable situation than it is for anything else.
	Emet-Selch felt the pulses deaden as she began to lean into the wall, the rawness of their urgency weaken, if only slightly.
	Hades leaves the trappings of lesser beings behind and claims his true form, slipping into the familiar body as easily he slips on his gloves.
	Who would have thought relieving their tensions would turn into more heated desire?” Hades murmured, fingertips trailing along Azem’s jaw, even that simple touch making them writhe.
	She placed a hand atop each of their heads, and only then did Hades realize with a flush of embarrassment that they’d forgotten to don mask and cowl.
	“How’s  Lazarus?” Hades continued, when Prometheus stayed quiet.
	Hades felt an odd feeling coursing through his soul; he withdraws from any accidental contact proximity might cause between you.
	“Has anyone ever told you the best way to stay warm, hero?” Emet-Selch drawled as he hooked two fingers into her skin-tight leggings before pulling her smalls and all down to her knees.
	Instead Hades said, “What do you have there?” “How is it that you can identify medicinal herbs and suggest culinary atrocities in the same breath?” Hades said.
	Not too far before, of course, as the thought of reliving the same months or even years mortified me, but I would still rather put myself through that than accidentally return to the time where Emet-Selch was already dead.
	In regard to Hades speaking on temperment, I truly feel that if one was tempered-as long as he-they would have some sudden realizations and breathability in their thoughts, their actions, once (even a fraction) has been removed.
	Hades knew that Hythlodaus was right.
	“I don’t think you want me to stop at all,” Emet-Selch murmurs, and his lips curl, widening his smile as his aether pushes into her further.
	Hades pulled the mage closer to him, choking a sob through the dust and ash.
	“We have to move on, Emet-Selch,” she said, sitting beside me and leaning in toward me.
	Hades’ arm around her shoulders pulled her a little closer as she curled up into his side.
	The moment the door clicked shut, Hades was tugging the robe open.
	Not when he can show Emet-Selch the memory directly.
	Emet-Selch lowered his hood, the cloth of the Ascians now admonished upon his skin.
	“Hades.”  Emet flinched, jerking back as he looked at the Exarch with an expression the mage could only describe as a mixture of pure sadness, despair, joy, and surprise.
	If Emet-Selch had been prone to pointless imaginings, he might have spent unconscionable lengths of time considering what Azem looked like underneath their robe.
	Raising his hand above his head, Hades snapped his fingers and a portal opened to their right.
	Emet-Selch stops at the second door they come to, which stands open, and knocks on the doorframe.
	If he didn’t want to work on this project, he only had to  say  and Hades would do it all by himself!
	Well, Hades has always been one for theatrics despite his serious nature so she shouldn’t even be all that surprised.
	Azem bit their lower lip as they ceased their movements and watched as Hades obeyed, his flushed body settling into an entrancing rhythm above them, his hips rolling and rotating as he sought to please both of them.

	Even with only half of his face visible, Prometheus could see Hades go through several facial expressions.
	Hades frowned as Emilia looked to him, the blue of her eyes gleaming against the crystal of the Ocular.
	Something of a snort caught in the back of Emet-Selch’s throat as he trailed behind Hythlodaeus.
	Hades' chest rose and fell in a slow tempo, and he appeared much younger, so visibly relaxed and momentarily free from his burdens.
	“There, was that so difficult?” Hythlodaeus brushed his lips over the ridge of Hades’s ear, his fingers grasping Hades’s length.
	Your gasp is like music to his ears, and Emet-Selch is relieved to find himself not at all surprised that his aether had struck out.
	“My dear Warrior of Darkness,” he said a little too reverently, “did you call me here to complain about Emet-Selch?” In spite of it all she sat down next to him and met his gaze.
	“I need you, Seph...” Hades tells you, quiet and shed of all pretense.
	He was giving Hades such a fond look he had to close his eyes before he felt embarrassed.
	Emet walked them to the recreation of their apartment.
	Hades scowled as he looked at her torso, surprised to find their tether absent from the space between them.
	Emet-Selch snaps his fingers and the voices cease as a translucent barrier springs up before you, locking your friends away behind it.
	Honed in on their presence, it charged toward Hythlodaeus at an alarming rate that had both Emet-Selch and Aeliana drag him aside at the very last second.
	Reeling from the explosion, Vala instinctively goes to wind back her arms around Hades' neck as he pounds into her body.
	My eyes narrowed in on Emet-Selch first, my mind telling him to back down.
	As the communicator’s light started blinking, indicating that it was taking a no doubt  very  angry voicemail, Prometheus looked back at Hades with a small grimace.
	Perhaps this Hythlodaeus had been a lost companion for Hades, and saw him in Raha.
	"How fortunate, my dear hero, that you only want what I have in abundance to give," Emet-Selch murmurs, and as he speaks, you can feel the familiar touch of his magic slithering across your skin once more.
	“I do this because I  want to, Hades.
	The beast withered to the ground and I nodded to Hades over my shoulder before heading for another part of the Flats.
	Hades kept a cool expression.
	Amaurot would be remade, the Convocation could resume their duty as stewards of order, she would be free to live with Hades in a world they themselves loved with all their heart and still do.
	The Ancients walking past were no more than the shades she remembers Hades recreating when she first traveled here, nothing appearing out of place in the slightest.
	"...entirely too much of  that  for what we  should  be doing," Emet-Selch mutters to no one in particular.
	it doesn't have too much going on but the things Hades says tell *a lot* into the past that hasn't really been explained too much from his pov.
	Though perhaps in response to the coolness of his hand, at his touch, Azem’s brow seemed to relax, and they turned into the sensation, making a dissatisfied sound as Emet-Selch drew away.
	His erection sprang free and Hades gave a small groan in response as her hands went to slide against his length.
	Emet-Selch clearly wants her to go along with him on her own to a degree, and Irene bites her lips as she looks down her body with bated breath before following suit.
	And it wouldn’t be very fun for either of us if I spoiled your secret, would it?” Emet-Selch purred.
	When we had calmed down and finished, I cleared the table as Hades pushed the coffee table out of the way and sat on the floor in front of the fireplace, leaning his back against the couch cushions.
	“I asked you a question, Hades.
	Hades sighed in exasperation and moved his king from d2 to d1.
	I locked eyes with Emet-Selch’s, his expression grim as he knelt in front of me, examining my face carefully.
	Emet-Selch stalked behind her, watching in quiet, brooding silence as she looked to the trees, the trails.
	“Oh do away with the formalities, Emet-Selch.
	“How interesting,” Emet says, pondering your words as you come to a halt before a curtained off building.
	At those words, Emet-Selchs heart seemed to stop and stutter within his chest.
	If Emet-Selch hadn’t been so fraught with emotion, and so exhausted from two days of constant monitoring while staying by Azem’s side, there's no doubt he would have been able to sense Elidibus’ watchful eye over them.
	He was being difficult this morning - Hades and Hythlodaeus had obediently donned their communal robes and masks, and were loitering in the front garden as Prometheus dug his heels in and refused to put his mask on.
	As the servant shut the door, Hades, Emet-Selch, Architect, Ascian, Paragon of the Source, Bringer of Chaos and Summoner of Zodiark, shivered in delight at the idea of the (R/N) selecting what he would wear in his subjugation, and he wasn’t sure why.
	Hades felt out the aether, humming when he realised his friend had somehow managed to slow the flow of time within the barrier’s sphere of influence, massively reducing the speed of the star’s collapse.
	Hades froze as the music stopped, realization dawning that he’d come full circle to the center of the hero’s aether, standing dumbstruck amongst chains and shards of her soul.
	“Well, I almost  drowned  yesterday, and I spent all day alone in bed, bored out of my mind being all ill,” Prometheus muttered, closing his eyes when he felt Hades nudge against his soul.
	Sometimes Emet-Selch wonders if the other hadn't drawn the better lot after all.
	“They are stronger than you give them credit for, Hades.
	Abruptly enough that it startled Hythlodaeus, but when he dismounted and turned his gaze toward the field, he understood why Emet-Selch would move no closer.
	And to yourself – the office of Emet-Selch, as well?
	She was certain that Hades was the only man for her… Though she isn’t naive enough to try and pretend like her memories are exactly restored to any large degree so there very well may be something big she’s still forgetting.
	They’re wrong, all of them.It isn’t sleeping Emet-Selch is overly fond of.
	Azem laughed to themselves, lifting one of the smallest instruments and running its cool tip up the underside of Hades’s cock.
	“Founder’s day,” Emet-Selch says, a light, rare smile gracing his features, “One of the city’s most joyous occasions.” In the street a procession of vehicles appear.
	Hades hesitated.
	“Emet-Selch,” he grits out, “thank you so much for having me as your guest.” He struggles against the pain blooming in his chest to keep his voice light, airy, condescending.
	I am, he thought dizzily, but he realised that he was also shying away from Hades’s soul, scrunching tight like an animal dying under a low-sitting porch.
	A lot of Creations were like that nowadays: whims, passing thoughts and ideas, barely kept in check by the likes of Hythlodaeus and Hades.
	It’s a little hard to believe that she’s going to be stepping foot in Hades’ phantom Amaurot again in only a short while now.
	But if there’s a way to use the Light instead of wielding it like a weapon, there might actually be a way to rid herself of the Light and save Hades without having to ask her scholarly friends for their input.
	“I want you to…to… I want you both inside me, at the same time,” Hades admitted, causing Azem’s smirk to broaden.
	“Emet-Selch,” Alisaie admonished.
	Hades crossed his arms, straightening up a little.
	You swayed a bit, cursed under your breath, and Hades rushed towards you, placing his hands on your shoulders.
	“I  did  write it for you,” Emet-Selch says simply.
	“Okay,” Aza said, when Emet-Selch paused expectantly, “Sounds neat.” Emet-Selch fixed him with an unreadable look, his eyes shadowed beneath his hair.
	“Why?” Hades stroked her arm gently with his fingers.
	Their tone as they spoke carried some weight, a warning if Emet-Selch had ever heard one.
	Hades… needed a moment.
	“I’ve won,” Prometheus purred, his hot breath fanning over Hades’s mask, pressing all his weight down on him.
	Emet sent her dreams of Amaurot - his soul weighing heavier the longer he waited to reveal who he was.
	He was pretty sure it all showed on his face, judging by how Hades’s calm expression became slightly concerned.
	"You shouldn’t be here," Emet-Selch frowns, black robe dusted off if only for the sake of appearance.
	Emet was surely putting Solus’ body to use.
	"Try that again, my dear," Emet-Selch mocks you as he takes a step closer.
	An instant later you feel… a tingle, a soft brush against your aetheric sense that somehow tastes of Emet-Selch, though you can’t understand how you know that.
	“T-too much…” Hades gasped in protest as the head of Azem’s dick pressed against his upon the shared sound.
	Hades relaxed ever so slightly.
	"And I still haven't forgiven him for it," Emet-Selch mumbles.
	You at least had the gratification that your fragile Sundered form made the great Hades lust.
	As they stood watching after his comrades, the Hyur’s trademark sour attitude—as Hades had come to know it as—drowned out his façade of pleasant comradery.
	“I do not have Emet-Selch’s vision, and he hasn’t my expertise.
	Hades starts, pulling away on instinct, only to see the voice belongs to a smiling woman with striking blue eyes.
	Everything was laid bare now, and he didn’t even hesitate to shift onto his back, to spread his thighs to let Hades get a nice, shamelessly eyeful of his state.
	Hades knew that.
	Your beautiful, cruel, indifferent Hades; your Hades who spent more time napping in some faraway corner of the city than speaking to you, who pretended to be busy and buried himself in one task or another, who would sooner tell Hythlodaeus than mention his nomination to you.
	“Zodiark never intended to spare her, Hades.
	Emet-Selch is on his belly with Azem enthusiastically wringing a litany of breathy cries from him as he fucks him within an inch of his life by the time Hythlodaeus makes it home.
	Thinking on it, Prometheus had spent most of this week with Hades, rather than Hythlodaeus, “Oh, yeah, we have.
	“She cannot be freed from bonds she refuses to forsake, Emet-Selch.
	Now Emet-Selch was really starting to lament the loss of the bottle, and a conjured one was closer and closer on the horizon with every passing word.“My own situation is not to help you overcome your own personal trauma, gunbreaker.
	“If it isn’t the honorable Emet-Selch!
	“He promised.” I breathed a laugh and looked towards Hades, still leaning against the stage next to Ryne as the young crowd bombarded her with questions about the battle.
	In the swirls of his mind, Emet knew it was true.
	Hades continued, unable to stop, “What sort of person would throw themself unflinching into the path of a beast to save a child?
	Emet-Selch is weird about bodies.
	“Hades!” Hades?
	"Hades," she whispers, and he is undone.
	Hades’s trembling hand was gently clasped by his friend, pressing his palm firmly against Prometheus’s cold cheek.
	She favored him with a wink, a silent promise that more yet awaited in their near future, but Emet-Selch had to be taught a lesson so she glanced over her shoulder and echoed his earlier demand, “Well?” Seconds passed as Emet-Selch fought to find his voice, his throat bobbing with the amount of times he had to swallow whatever reply sat ripe on his tongue in order to maintain his blasé demeanor.
	Hades' hand is warm yours, prepatory magicks welling in an anticipation his demeanor reveals naught of.
	Hades laughs at that.
	“Oh,” Emet-Selch adds, “Idas and Adromeda if you would stay behind?” Emet-Selch smiles and Xelinah wonders if they’ve reached whatever conclusion he clearly wants them to reach.
	Hades let him ramble on, still studying the bird.
	Even Emet-Selch might miss the wisp of blue that puttered around the Warrior of Light, never joining her but glimmering in her presence.
	Hades couldn’t help it: for a moment, he imagined it.
	Hythlodaeus found his way over to Hades and wrapped his arms around him from the front.
	Hades hummed, watching the poor man shuffle off with his shoulders slumped, like he was carrying the weight of the world on them.
	The Emet she had been spending time with, helping, or whom she felt she had been helping, did not seem the same as the one she’d journeyed with during her time on the First, at least prior.
	Hades grows as he enters, shedding the title of Emet-Selch, the responsibilities, the weariness; assuming his proper size, his true form.
	Hades’s mouth is open wide, lips glistening with saliva as he pants, cheeks flushed, eyes glazed over in lustful desire.
	“Emet-Selch!” another Scion called, their voice muffled.
	You are not even entirely sure if this is still humanly possible or if the large amount of Emet-Selch's aether flowing through you has done something to you as well.
	“This was your doing, Emet-Selch.
	She pushed against my side and I humored her, walking around the room as we waited for Hades to finish his obligatory rounds.
	Hades didn’t wait for her and she didn’t expect him to while she stood there stunned.
	Oh, Emet-Selch?
	Beside him, Hades felt bored and tired.
	He would not risk feeding whatever fell thing Emet-Selch had conjured with the Tower's strength.
	Hades’ breath came out in a pained chuckle as he looked up from his position near her abdomen, hands playing with her breasts idly.
	Hades muffles his cry into the other’s shoulder, but Hythlodaeus’s rings clear in the room as the hands previously holding him in place now move him, pushing him down and down and down inch by throbbing inch until it’s completely sheathed inside.
	And here, before the sticky mess grows too bothersome, cocooned in love and warmth and the certainty of home, Hades lets himself sleep.
	It’d been long since Hades had witnessed aether from a soul Unsundered, it was an unspoken taboo from their time in the Convocation, for any without bond, or love at least.
	Hades’s eyes rolled back with pleasure as he quickly gave into the varied affections, a deep moan rumbling from his chest as Hythlodaeus carefully began to work him apart.
	Hades lifted his hands.
	Hades breathed a sigh of exasperation.
	But then that leaves the problem of if she has to go to the Crystarium to talk with G’raha about meeting with Beq Lugg, then what is she going to do with Hades?
	As the light began to glow between them, Hades could feel a similar warmth settling in his own chest.
	It was lonely… but Prometheus couldn’t imagine extending his very tight circle of friends beyond Hades and Hythlodaeus.
	Hades wanted to wince as she walked over to him, pushing the red-clad twin behind the safety of her back.
	This time, Hythlodaeus allowed himself release, gladly adding to the load Hades already carried.
	At least Emet got to complain about it in his own narration... Emet-Selch tuts, “Who do you think started that trend, my dear?” Emet-Selch’s hair is well past his waist, more suited towards a woman of finest nobility than… really, any sort of person who would be expected to do more moving than walking across a room once in a while.
	“How, specifically, do you want me to help?” Hades asked, leaning against one of her bedposts.
	“You  win  , you  idiot  !” Hades snapped, kicking his legs uselessly, “Now, get off!
	“Oh, I see,” Emet-Selch interjected, finally speaking up.
	Hythlodaeus stroked Hades's hand which sat snug in Hythlodaeus's grip.
	"Ask nicely," sneered Emet-Selch, lightly running a finger along G'raha's abused length "and I'll finish you off as well.
	Yet, before his words could form, Emet was continuing.
	Hades is curious, so he watches you watch him.
	They shook and shuddered and clawed, nails leaving angry red lines upon Hades’s skin.
	Though this was a trait that had carried on with Emet-Selch for as long as Elidibus and Lahabrea could remember, to the days of Amaurot.
	“You’ve never fucked her, have you?” Emet-Selch challenges as G’raha finds himself lining himself against the Warrior’s cunt, spread wide for him, arousal glistening on her thighs.
	“Well,” Emet-Selch drawled, deftly picking up her abandoned drink and taking a sip of it—too sweet, the spices applied with a fumbling hand; he set it down.
	“You’ll have to forgive me for not having a second glass prepared,” Thancred mused, taking a sip from his own drink as he pondered it, before flicking his eyes back up to Emet-Selch.
	But the same goes for you and Emet-Selch.
	With a grunt, he lifted it up and, without hesitating, Hades lazily rolled over and under the duvet with him.
	“Hades.
	“Took you long enough,” Emet-Selch’s voice gripes from across the apartment.
	She finds Emet with two flutes of champagne in between one hand, and he smirks widely when he realizes why she had been absent from his side.
	Emet-Selch rolled his eyes, until they fell on me.
	“I’m… so sorry, Hades,” she said softly and I looked up at her, forcing a smile.
	Hythlodaeus slid himself out of Hades, then turned an inviting smirk toward Azem, one hand still on Hades’s ass, pulling his flesh to the side.
	Hades steals the words from your mouth before you can protest, lips capturing yours into a heady, desperate kiss.
	“If our friend has been having Echoes of this intensity, but seemingly only when in the presence of Emet-Selch, it requires our attention.” “Emet-Selch thought, perhaps, that the location was simply triggering too many memories.” “In which case, they could indeed be Emet-Selch’s memories she views.
	“Ah, I see him!” Hythlodaeus said, pointing at a gaggle of scholars, an irate Hades at its core, “Oh dear, he’s looking very annoyed.”  “I think that’s just his face,” Prometheus said, vanishing his now empty plate and watching Hades get mobbed, “Hey… Hyth…” Beside him, Hades didn’t look much better, radiating the same aura as a pissed off cat as they skulked through Mentor Metis’s front door, trailing water everywhere.
	If there had been a talent that Hythlodaeus, Hades, and their Azem had shared, it had been the astounding capability to pretend like absolutely nothing was bothering them even under tremendous strain.
	Hades kneels on the floor before your panting form resting wanton upon the lounge.
	“A portion of my soul, you mean,” Hades murmured.
	I squeezed Alphinaud’s shoulder before sliding my fingers into Hades’.
	Then, just as abruptly as Emet-Selch had begun, he stopped.
	Without the fabric in the way… Prometheus’s eyes fluttered shut, a soft, raw noise catching low in his throat, barely noticing Hades’s hand trailing with deceptive slowness from his ass, over his hip, down his happy trail to- He felt himself go tense - not from anything unpleasant, but just from the  feel  of Hades’s hand curling around his arousal, light pressure, a gentle squeeze and slow strokes.
	Hades released a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding.
	Hades shook his head and pressed into her, coaxing his legs betwixt her own in a slow, meticulous step.
	Hades winced as his chest pulled at his stiches, his breath heavy and labored.
	“You’re smiling.” Hades noted.
	As her mouth opened, Hades dragged his tongue along her lips, a light coffee flavor, he realized, still lingering on them.
	Aestelle paused just short of biting her small piece of bread, her eyes glued on the door to the kitchen Hades has yet to walk through.
	"H-Ha-- Emet?"
	She was not quite sure of the enigma that was Professor Emet Selch.
	“My most venerated Emet-Selch, you know I love nothing more than theoretical banter.
	Hythlodaeus chuckles, “Oh I have had my share of sleepovers with the illustrious Emet-Selch, but I do have business to be getting back to .Worry not, my friend, for we will see each other again.
	We thought it prudent to err on the side of caution.” Emet-Selch scoffed.
	Hades huffed into the kiss before pulling back with a muttered, “You know, normally you  kiss back.” He could see the slight dusting of freckles over the bridge of Hades’s nose, and the amber flecks in his golden eyes, and found that his brain was just… fucking, doing nothing.
	Thancred has yet to speak to her since Hades left them in the Qitana Ravel.
	Such trysts did not happen often; Emet-Selch’s visits became less and less regular, and sometimes he did not have pleasure on his mind at all.
	Emet-Selch is not the speaker, but he does fancy himself a pleasant conversationalist.
	“Hades,” he mumbles.
	Hades nudged his front door open without a thought, shoving his papers back as he heaved himself out of his chair.
	As in, the both of us?” Emet-Selch cut in rapidly, “Of course I mean the both of us!” In truth, Hades had loved their people and possessed a spirit capable of great empathy and kindness.
	The smaller man’s moans reverberate in his throat, adding to the stimulation around Hades’s cock, and then he’s moaning, offering the sounds of his pleasure for Hythlodaeus to swallow.
	“Something on your mind Emet-Selch?
	And Hades did just that.
	You sigh deeply as the soothing heat begins to soak into your abused body, relaxing bonelessly against Emet-Selch’s chest, his warm embrace the only thing keeping you from sliding limply down into the tub as if you were entirely liquid yourself.
	Hades snapped his focus into the chain, willing himself into the spaces, the gaps, with the power he could feel building beneath his palm.
	But while Hades finally hid himself behind the mask of Emet-Selch, to serve the people and do what was in their best interests, Persephone had walked away.
	Did you not come down here to protect your friends from your transformation into a sin eater?” Hades asks, arching a strong eyebrow from his place by the kitchen table.
	Emet closed his eyes, wondering how long he could afford to sleep for.
	Emet-Selch watched the breeze rustle his hair, as it drifted about him like lavender petals in the breeze Beautiful.
	Hades needs her first.
	But they both knew what it meant: no matter how many times Hades poured out his vitriolic hate for the Warrior of Light.
	I exchanged a glance with Hades.
	You could assault his senses, suck and trace and tease every ilm of him that you could reach, wring every onze of delight from his flesh, and still Hades would have to stay still and silent for it.
	But his conversation with Hades had prompted him to consider what he did next, to examine his options.
	“Enough of that,” Hades muttered as he gently pushed you back down.
	“Not that I know of,” You feel heat creep up your face at the words, during which Hades squeezes where he is twirled around you, letting you feel him all along yourself.
	Emet-Selch’s interrogation.
	I wouldn’t even have made it out of the Propylaion if Emet-Selch and Hythlodaeus hadn’t shown up.” “If only,” Emet-Selch, leaning against the trunk of a tree, murmured with a single brow raised.
	Hades leaned his head back in contemplation.
	“She was not whole, Hades.
	He at least has the decency to look sheepish, but that doe-eyed look from beneath long lashes reminds Emet-Selch in explicit detail of the last time he saw it: with Hythlodaeus on his knees, red mouth wrapped around his-- This is neither the place nor the time for him to indulge a trip down a somewhat inappropriate memory lane, and if Emet-Selch is honest with himself, he's both horrified and embarrassed by the sudden intrusion of thought.
	Hades huffed, “Considering he was being unfairly ganged up on by those several centuries his senior, it’s unsurprising he started to flounder.” The adults’ stiffened slightly, Hades’s barb striking true.
	Emet-Selch lets out a curse and pulls his fingers from yours.
	Hades leaned his head against his hand.
	The tap of his own sandals was mirrored by that of the leather boots Emet so fondly wore.
	A halo of broken jewelry and crumpled clothing around them, Emet-Selch studied G'raha laid bare before him, face unreadable as he took in the fusion of flesh and crystal on the planes of his torso.
	He knew it was a fleeting thing, not something that was truly there given the growing concerns with the Warrior and the meddling of one Emet-Selch.
	Emet-Selch's voice snaps out like a shot.
	Hades did not have time for this.
	“Of course they wouldn’t!” Hades then yelled, looking past her to her party of friends.
	When Hades finally let go, he was pleased to see her skin darkening quickly, a sign of an oncoming bruise.
	Prometheus was briefly tempted to say he did want to do something else, if only to wipe off that smug look on Hades’s face.
	With the last of her strength she pushed herself to stand, staggering in front of the redhead and for a brief moment, Aestelle saw true fear streak across Hades face as a dark spike impaled her, tearing through flesh and allowing the Light to come spewing out.
	Emet-Selch stands up with you cradled in his arms, and heads towards the bedroom’s door.
	Hades understands the laws of creation and he understands that the world can never truly be brought back.
	“Ah, whatever will I do without you, Hades?” he laughed playfully.
	He admires him, if he’s being honest with himself, but Emet-Selch is so rarely that these days.
	Hades wasn’t sure the expression he made at those words, but it must have been just as she had hoped for, as when he looked to her, she was beaming in delight.
	He loved Hades, he wanted Hades, he wanted to  possess  Hades… which was reciprocated in kind.
	She can feel Emet-Selch taking a step closer before he clears his throat.
	Finally, Hades drifts off to sleep, dreams of home, and feels at peace.
	Now imagine if I had told you any of this when Emet first showed himself to us…” Said you had to keep this from us since we only would have grown warier of both yourself and Emet-Selch if you explained everything in its entirety.” He said, leaning back on his hands and looking up to the murky waters of the Tempest being held at bay by Bismarck’s breath.
	The name, Hades, wanted to leap off his tongue.
	Emet-Selch looked at Y’shtola sharply then, narrowing his eyes as he pointed at her.
	“Emet-Selch, wait!” you shout after him.
	And that ‘somewhere else’ had been in a cave in Thanalan, talking to Emet-Selch, who is, by his own admission, immortal.
	“It doesn’t look constipated,” Hades snapped, but he did give the mask a dubious once over, “Maybe I should soften some of the edges, though…”  Prometheus let Hades mull over his constipated mask, slipping on his much nicer on.
	And as you ponder whether there might be a way to save Ryne from Her influence, another, even worse thought hits you:  Thancred was ready to go through you in his blind hatred of Emet-Selch, of Ascians.
	Hades laughed.
	“Oh come now my dear, surely a massage is not a foreign concept to you?” Emet rolls his eyes.
	“W-what?” Hades’s attention was torn from her again, and returned to Tataru.
	…Though Hades’s attitude towards him left much to be desired.
	He is unsurprised at Hades’ presence and probably sensed him as soon as the door opened.
	“Still,” he said, straightening, “I have not treated you in the manner etiquette demands, and for that you have my humblest apologies.” Hades let his eyes return to her, finally, and their gazes met, then he looked down again.
	Azem over him, straddling his lap, arms looped around his neck, Hythlodaeus’ behind them, holding Azem’s torso, face buried in Emet-Selch’s shoulder.
	Emet-Selch leans forward to kiss her, sloppy and greedy, moaning against her as her tongue moves into his mouth.
	“Ah yes, which reminds me,” Emet-Selch turned to me, ignoring the fuming Alisaie, who’s face only began to match her outfit more.
	You tell yourself not to worry, that surely Emet-Selch’s absolutely frigid look when he whisked himself away with Hythlodaeus’ shade meant nothing terrible.
	But, no, Prometheus fully intended to swoop in, pluck Hythlodaeus from the jaws of danger, and leave Hades to mop up this mess while he checked their friend over.
	If Hades were here there was no doubt he would look at everything that wasn’t like her- but Hythlodaeus let a smile perk up on his lips as he let his fingers pluck cords into a melody he had once played for her.
	“While it truly is a pity about the company, I would not deny the drink.” Emet-Selch heaved himself into the cushioned single seat across from Thancred, who had only smirked slightly at his unkind words.
	Before you can question what you're doing yourself, you turn your head to look directly into a very wide-eyed Emet-Selch, who leans back like he's trying to escape your gaze.
	“I  thought  we could simply admire the view together,” Emet-Selch began, amusement in his voice as his eyes slid to me, giving me a suggestive look that made heat rise to my cheeks.
	“Despite your innocent displays of youthful naivety, you have shown me time and time again that your age is merely a number, your true self much more mature than even Emet-Selch gives you credit for.
	There was a reason Lahabrea had been made the speaker, and despite working with the man in an official capacity, Hades never seemed to remember it.
	I am entirely sure.” Emet responds, cupping his chin in his hand in mock reflection.
	What a fitting irony Emet-Selch had saved her from.
	The Exarch’s head snapped up and he turned, looking at Emet-Selch, who was until a moment ago, slouched against one of the supports of the Ocular, talking about Twelve knows what.
	“Will you stop scowling,” Prometheus swatted his shoulder, jerking Hades out of his hazy, drowsy thoughts, “It’s bringing the mood down.”  “Hn,” Hades grunted, blinking his eyes open, “Are you almost ready?”  “How kind,” Hades said insincerely.
	When Elidibus swipes his thumb over her clit, she gushes over their hands, sweet and sticky and wet, so damnably wet, and her walls clamp down on their fingers before relaxing again, and Elidibus slides two in alongside Emet-Selch’s two.
	A different expression was held on Hades’s face.
	Out of sight and earshot, and it was then that Hythlodaeus conveyed his plan to the others while providing Aeliana with clear instructions on how to ensure Emet-Selch’s cooperation.
	Pleased by my change in attitude, Hades tucked my arm through his and we walked down each aisle, pausing to watch children play games for prizes.
	She let her eyes follow Emet-Selch, trying to parse her feelings about the words that had been said.
	I don’t think that will work with Hades, Feo Ul…” Aestelle said sadly.
	Emet-Selch lifted his head.
	I closed my mouth in realization—realization that, in this timeline, we had never had our final all-out battle, and so he had never revealed his name to me, and I shouldn’t know that his true name is Hades.
	“Will you—“ Elidibus moans between his thrusts, caught between her hot heat and Emet-Selch’s probing finger.
	“My Hades,” they said, sorrow and affection at one in their tone.
	“Hades is a grown man and a member of the Convocation of Fourteen,” You shot back without missing a beat, “I find it highly unlikely he is unable to devise a solution for this particular problem on his own.” “The esteemed Emet-Selch defers to your superior wisdom; I concede, I am yet the sulkier of us two.” Hades catches himself, luckily; self-pity is not appropriate at all for the moment.
	Hades moved to place himself between me and Elidibus and crossed his arms.
	Was I also not guilty of omission, same as Emet-Selch?
	“Gah, a...a trick of the light,” Emet-Selch brought his gloves to his eyes, covering himself from her view.
	Emet-Selch cannot see this, he cannot look at this.
	“She,” Hades repeated, “You’re humanising your  armigers  now?”  “Emet-Selch?” A small gaggle of scholars - from the Concept Inspection Department, if Prometheus recognised their masks correctly - immediately crowded around Hades.
	The Emissary has asked for the creation of an empire, a massive request to create technology they will utilize in further calamities, and Emet-Selch knows he is best-suited to this task.
	Hades trusted in Prometheus too much to even consider it ever happening.
	Unsurprisingly, Emet-Selch took no time in crossing his arms and closing his eyes, opting to nap to pass the time.
	Every time he’d come close, gasping and eyes rolling back, stars exploding behind his eyelids, Hades would force the pace slower, squeezing the base of his dick over the cockring until the cramp of orgasm passed and Prometheus descended even deeper into desperate insanity.
	Did he get turned into an animal, a cat perhaps?” Urianger flinched, which made Emet smile.
	If Emet-Selch had relished the chance to argue for his motivations in a setting where he would not be outright dismissed because of their differing goals and ideologies.
	“Hmph, if I must—” protested Emet-Selch but when Hythlodaeus slipped an arm over his shoulder and leaned in for a kiss that set his toes curling, he ceased all manners of resistance.
	Stopping, Hades tugged on her hand to prevent her from walking any further.
	“We merely wondered—” A hiss escaped Aeliana when Emet-Selch nudged the top of her tail again and a pleasurable wave ripped through her nerves.
	Hades could sense a hue of gold, as if a sunset, standing at the base of his legs.
	He faded into the darkness as Emet wished, hoping for the billionth time that his ultimate goal would be to rejoin everyone after proof of concept.
	At least Hades had not been so thoughtless as to drag Hyth into this without his knowledge.
	Cheers.---I ship Hyth/Hades hard.
	Emet-Selch began gently setting me down in the large bed in his room.
	Hythlodaeus passed him a sheet of offensively loud pink paper, and Hades squinted at it suspiciously.
	He didn’t want to think about Emet-Selch in humanising terms.
	I left thee with the sight for a purpose…” The Oracle’s eyes fell on Hades’ sadly, pityingly.
	“I’m hoping my Echo will show me what it is Hades is planning.” Both her aether and Hades’ react the same, sharing in the heartache and despair of seeing their lost home once more.
	Oh, no, Emet-Selch thinks to himself, smiling, rolling a sensitive nipple between gloves fingers and hearing you respond with a low whine.
	Emet-Selch taunts, and something in you goes cold at the realization that he knows.
	I sat on a nearby rock as I explained everything to them as best as I could—how Emet-Selch had taken me to Amaurot once more in hopes of talking, and how, once there, I had begun to reawaken memories of my past life, memories that belonged to the soul which burned brightly within me.
	"Hades, bring out the leylines."
	Emet-Selch clenched his hands hard enough to hurt - but after a moment relaxed them with a slow, heavy exhale.
	Uncertainty or dissatisfaction -- G'raha could not tell which -- darkened Emet-Selch's expression, and they both breathed hard as Emet-Selch set his mouth into a thin line.
	Now that Emet-Selch remained alive, Elidibus, in turn, would most likely have no reason to fight us.
	But now that Emet-Selch does what he does, something clicks into place.
	His office surprisingly offers no reprieve from the weather, remaining obstinately of a similar temperature, resulting in an Emet-Selch who is mortifyingly rumpled, and in a very foul mood indeed.
	Whistling appreciatively, Hades looked through the letters again.
	I hadn’t even realized that the churning and thrashing had stopped, though I was hardly surprised, as close to Emet-Selch as I had been all night.
	When you woke, you realized Emet-Selch was still here  and  that he was untempered.”  Hades nodded, understanding entirely her situation as, not so long ago, he was feeling the same.
	Even when Prometheus had been, admittedly, out of mind with fear and pain when the Doom drew close, Elidibus had tried to keep him calm and mediate his aggressive arguments with Hades right until the end.
	Slowly standing up, Hades brushed down the front of his emperor regalia and looked to her friends with a bored expression, shrugging as he does so.
	Invectives poured out of G'raha in a furious stream -- murderer, rapist, monster -- before Emet-Selch picked up one of his gloves and shoved it roughly into G'raha's mouth.
	However,  you may be reckless enough to present yourself without protective measures, Emet-Selch, but I will not be so nonchalant.” “This additional Light within her is blinding in its intensity, Emet-Selch,” he muttered.
	She flicks her eyes up to meet Emet-Selch’s, and even if it is just this moment, even if this is the very last moment — she is happy.
	Elidibus and Emet-Selch have already told you that we must needs look elsewhere for our solution to this impending catastrophe─where do you think you’re going?
	Hades was fairly sure he could outwalk the pathetic yet terrifying thing, “Shh, it’s okay.
	When Hades had said that knowledge is a burden, she hadn’t quite understood what he meant until just now.
	“Oh, good…” Peering up through her lashes, she met Emet-Selch who observed her with a gaze that was tender in a way she’d rarely seen of him before.
	All of the drama with Hades is just going to keep ramping up until we meet him in his phantom recreation of Amaurot.~ And we might see Elidibus being referenced a little bit more the closer we get to the confrontation with Hades ;') Needless to say that this fic is going to continue even after Hades so we can see just what becomes of our favorite Emissary ^^ Hades and Elidibus, they need her.
	Aestelle glanced around, watching as shooting stars fly past while Hades voice fills the open space, a singular large white orb hanging above their heads.
	Hades pressed a warm hand to the nape of his neck, followed by the sensation of healing magic sweeping through him.
	Emet-Selch waves his hand lazily at the translucent shimmer that separates you from the Scions on the other side, and it flashes for an instant before settling.
	Emet-Selch watched their throat move as they swallowed.
	And after a thousand, thousand lifetimes, Hades truly cried.
	Hades finally allowed himself to look, once his back was to (Y/N), once he was sure she would not see the tears if he had been betrayed.
	“There was no other way to calm the torrential grief that filled him, young child of Hydaelyn,” He answered, though His words did nothing to calm me, even admitting that He would release Emet-Selch once He was finished.
	Emet-Selch’s breath hitched, too often deprived of Azem’s full visage.
	So long as you extend the same courtesy to me.” Emet-Selch turned then, desperate not only to escape the delightful company of his colleague, but to get the much-needed shuteye his body craved.
	Persephone snaps out of her daze and steps quickly backwards as vines crack at Hades's feet.
	One thing is very, very clear: Hythlodaeus loves his stories as much as Emet-Selch loves adding his own dramatic flair to them.
	Adriene and Lay both jump into the conversation, adding some details here and there, but Cassia’s attention is stuck on the very picture of casual disinterest Emet-Selch makes as he leans against the wall not too far from her, watching the whole procedure with half-closed eyes and a bored expression on his face.
	“How would your  beloved  Emet-Selch feel if you let yourself die now?” No wonder Hades likes you so much.” Hades came out of a tent, concern in his eyes.
	Prometheus and Hades obligingly paused, the pair of them eyeing each other with barely contained, passionate energy while Hythlodaeus confirmed that yes, Tuesday did indeed sound good for his check up.
	She was sitting on the bed with Emet-Selch.
	At that moment a portal opens in the room, Emet-Selch stepping out looking less than pleased.
	“Wow, Hades, you really can sleep anywhere, huh?” Prometheus teased him when he sluggishly straightened up, “You were snoring, just so you know.” “Lies,” Hades muttered, his voice rough with sleep, “Are you done yet?” Behold!” Prometheus flourished dramatically at the results of his labour: a three-tiered chocolate cake, heavy on the cream just like Hades enjoyed.
	But I’m no expert at all in these things which is why I asked for you to come and help us with both Emet and finding a way to bring my friends home.” Placing a hand to their chin, Beq Lugg looked at Hades and then closed their eyes as they thought over her words.
	Hades growled.
	“How very charming of you,”  comes Emet-Selchs bone-dry reply.
	“How does it look?” Hades asked the other man, who dismissed his assistants and came around so I could see him as he addressed us both.
	Sorry, Hades, but this was for your own good.
	Hades lifted and eyebrow.
	Anyone else might look and see a bad mood, but Hythlodaeus looked and saw sorrow beyond anything he had ever seen Hades feel.
	Persistent and soothing both while he told her of Emet-Selch’s skill and feats, the adventures he had accompanied Azem on and how those had made the man a vaunted hero in his own right.
	Hades shuddered and moaned as Hythlodaeus pressed into him alongside Azem, the pleasure threatening to overwhelm him in an instant.
	“Azem!” Hades calls out, muttering apologies to the many people he bumps into on his way.
	It does not look good for you to hide things, Emet-Selch.
	“The forest is part of who she is?” Emet-Selch paused, deep in thought that was far too much for the simple book.
	“Is this who our people become?” Emet-Selch hissed.
	Hades was wondering how the two could even be compared, when one of them shone so brightly with a thought and the other would be torn apart by the same radiance.
	Hythlodaeus blinks, “Well, i’m not quite sure that’s what I was going for, but if it works.” He shrugs, and then makes sure to catch his friend’s gaze, “Be civil, Hades.
	Emet-Selch had occupied his time by completely ignoring the Warrior of Light and focusing instead on the Exarch.
	Was my staying at her bedside for two days without rest what finally tipped you off?” Emet-Selch queried disdainfully.
	Hades knows all too well how intimate the connection between mind and body goes.
	“To observe,” Hades said in that low, drawl of his, “And see how others do it.” He had excelled in what lessons Mentor Metis had given them, had beaten Hythlodaeus and Hades in vigorous debate (though, Hades was very tricky to argue with, since he had this way of wording things that made his meaning obscure).
	That Hades had simply gone and cut his hair on a whim.
	Not long later, Hades and I stood side-by-side in front of the portal.
	“Hades,” Hythlodaeus whispered.
	“I...have theories,” Emet said.
	He was Emet-Selch and he had a duty to complete.
	“E-Emet-Selch...” you cough, white bile spilling from your mouth as your body convulses in pain.
	So he poured his energies into plans for the final battle, focused his mind on anything but the emotions he had felt in the brief moment before Emet had absconded through his ashy portal.
	But," Emet-Selch's voice dropped abruptly to a snarl, his grip on the Exarch becoming so tight that he cried out softly and bucked against the hand that held him.
	“To what end do you think, Hades?” Hythlodaeus asked, softly.
	Sometimes Hades hated him for it - if he had survived, maybe, as always, he could have bridged this gap of misunderstanding between him and Prometheus, made him stay- “...you returned with a basketful of grapes,” Hades picked up the story when the silence threatened to snap into frigid awkwardness, “And marched right into your disciplinary meeting with it, presenting it as evidence for why you shouldn’t be censured.” “He forgot he hated you for a whole hour,” Hades agreed, “Quite an achievement.” “Yeah…” Prometheus’s smile faded, and his gaze settled back on him, “What do you want, Hades?” Hades sighed and took a few steps closer.
	“Alright, I have to go before Emet-Selch gets more impatient,” she said and I rolled my eyes.
	“What did you do?” the man who was Emet-Selch inquired hesitantly.
	He flushed a little, lifting a hand to wave it clean, when Hades made a small noise.
	“Honestly?” the other man asked, to which Hades nodded.
	“Stop being such a bore, Hades!” “Fine fine, but only because you told me too so nicely.” She giggled, walking around the table to stand beside Hades while he placed his mask over his face as well.
	“Before you barrage me with your ceaseless questions, I would lay her in a bed,” Emet-Selch shot back impatiently, somehow restraining himself from merely snapping them all out of the building so he could do what needed to be done.
	Both Hythlodaeus and Emet-Selch cease their back-and-forth at the sound and turn to her in surprise.
	Utterly preposterous,” Emet-Selch spat his words out when he found an onze of strength to respond at all.
	Emet-Selch admitted with a wry smirk.
	“Look at you,” murmured Hythlodaeus as he cupped Emet-Selch’s chin in a free hand.
	Hades would call you mad; even Hythlodaeus would shake his head at this venture and try to convince you to see reason.
	“My dear, I am as baffled by this as you are,” Emet-Selch assures her.
	In an attempt to hold her one last time, Hades lunged forward only for Aestelle to disappear right as he managed to wrap his arms around her small frame.
	Prometheus had things he knew that Hades would never, so it stood to reason that his hunch on Xerora  actually  being an old social experiment, long since abandoned, was true.
	!” Hades exclaimed indignantly as Azem withdrew, and Hythlodaeus pressed the new toy into Hades.
	He tears you away from despair, your Hades, as he always has, covers up your doubts and speaks over them with reassurances until you believe him, truly.
	Hades reached up to tuck a lock of hair behind my ear, a coolness to his fingers that was not usually there.
	Tears welled up in the corners of her eyes and for a fleeting moment, a look of confusion flashed across Hades' face while Aestelle struggled to keep her composure.
	Quickly she sprinted after Hades who had already broken out into a full-on run.
	With his thumb, Hades began to slowly trace the outlines of the scars from her inner wrist, pausing to feel the way the skin felt against his own.
	“Hades,” Hythlodaeus chided quietly, “That’s rude.”  Hades didn’t seem overly bothered, but he did tip his chin down a little as he glanced at the mask in Prometheus’s hands.
	Hades stared at him, utterly affronted, “What ?” Hades stood there for a moment, clearly debating whether or not he could get away with pushing his luck.
	Hades, on the other hand, looks terribly exhausted.
	Hades hummed vaguely, still not seeing Prometheus’s point.
	Emet-Selch almost felt bad at how pointless this show of stubbornness was, though.
	Hades could feel cold anger beginning to boil within him.
	I tilted my head towards Hades once again, crossing my arms over my chest, one brow raising as I recalled a certain bet we had made in the fields of Lakeland, a promise to play a prank on my friends he had yet to carry out.
	No matter what, I promise to convince Urianger and Thancred that Emet can stay with us and even become a Scion.” “A Scion, Emet-Selch?” She repeated.
	Hythlodaeus is particularly fond of it, in fact, Hythlodaeus is the one who suggested it initially, and then took a near fanatical amount of delight in making Emet-Selch cum so hard he couldn't stand, several consecutive times.
	“It is one of my many talents,” Emet-Selch says, indicating a little bow with a hint of flourish.
	The click in the lock was the only warning Hades received before (Y/N) swept into the room, her face unreadable, the household servants trailing in her wake.
	Ergo, if Hades was going to return to his ascendance, return to being Emet-Selch, he needed her cooperation.
	Emet-Selch’s voice is demanding, making it clear he expects no more backtalk, and as tempted as Irene is, she did come here to learn after all.
	If Hades is to wake, then she doesn’t want him to wake up alone, and she leaves it at that.
	Did you scare her away, Hades?” It’s teasing, but Hades’ huffs and looks away.
	His friend did so, chin tilting up, and Hades brushed a feather-light kiss over Prometheus’s throat, felt the strong pulse against his lips, warm and fluttering, and-  bit down .
	He bowed briefly to Emet as he graciously accepted the envelope.
	“  Emet,”  he pleaded, his tongue appearing briefly to lick his lower lip, “please.” What with Emet far in his late thirties and his student barely of age, she could’ve been his daughter for Hydaelyn’s sake.
	She asked me to teach her the song.” The look this incited on Emet-Selch’s face was one of utter exasperation.
	“I don’t...I don’t  have  time, Emet-Selch.” Enough secrets.” My eyes shot to him as his narrowed in on Emet-Selch.
	“Exactly what are you suggesting, Emet-Selch?” Hythlodaeus asked sincerely.
	He wasn’t sure what Fandaniel meant to accomplish, sending Zenos to her while the two of them were separated, but if Fandaniel was under the impression that Emet-Selch would hesitate in killing the great-grandson of Solus Zos Galvus, then he was sorely mistaken.
	He was very adamant that his failure was a result of Emet-Selch’s meddling, with another white-robed Emissary at his side.
	“That news has already been delivered to me, Lahabrea.” Hades makes no secret of the venom in his voice, impatience coloring his movements as well as his words.
	I couldn’t tell if they were perhaps Emet-Selch or Emilia, their figures looked the same, but-” “Undone is a term one could use to describe it, yes.” Hades looked to the hero as well, watching as she breathed.
	“Morning, Icarus,” Prometheus said easily, acting oblivious to the tense mood, “I hope you don’t mind Emet joining us today.
	He was dozing off, his head leaning against Hades’s shoulder, and Hades didn’t have the heart to wake him.
	Hades crawls.
	There is a hint of regret on Emet-Selch’s face as he looks at her for a moment before he shakes his head.
	Hades could feel himself withdrawing.In all manner of truth, how was he to answer that?
	No longer was he Solus Zos Galvus, but Hades.
	He still had his arms locked around Hades’s shoulders, fingers weakly pressed into the skin.
	“I’ll remember you,” the reflection said, and Hades didn’t know if it was a mercy or cruelty that he sounded exactly like Prometheus.
	Hades raised an eyebrow, but the Emissary continued.
	Just because Halone and the Twelve don’t want Hades to die doesn’t mean they can stop fate from stealing him away again.
	As if they did not want to risk having their little tea party in the Rift, lest Emet-Selch intrude upon their chatter.
	Hades lets one hand fall down your inner thigh, the smooth bed of his dull nails sweeping down supple skin to carefully knead along the muscle at the juncture of your sex.
	I don’t think Emet-Selch saw it after the war.
	Trapped like this, Hades couldn’t cast his magic, and Prometheus had the advantage.
	Hades and I watched them for a long while, testing the barrier.
	“Emet-Selch,” the astrologian admonished at my blatant disrespect, but I ignored him, intently focused on Hydaelyn.
	Hades is brash and blunt when things don’t go his way, when it seems like someone might actively be working against him.
	Emet-Selch had pushed him to the limits of his defiance, trying to tease out and then  claw out  his knowledge on winding back time.
	Hades will drag him before Zodiark, kicking and screaming if he had to, and pin him down if he must, to make sure the Blessing  sticks.
	Whether Hades was talking to Hythlodaeus or Vala is unclear.
	Hades watched as she turned her gaze to him, then to the staircase behind, gesturing for him to follow.
	No one denied what Elidibus said, not even Hades.
	Hades hummed.
	I trust you will watch over our dear friend, Emet-Selch?” Hades smiled.
	Emet-Selch isn’t moving inside her, though; all his intention seems to be focused on kissing her senseless.
	Yes, alone in his thoughts, Hades remembered the woman who spoke lovely words and the way she had smelled as she pressed her form to his.
	Hades' hand is at the back of her head, fingers digging into her hair and pulls.
	She won’t give up just as Hades never gave up on her.
	"Oh,  Hades  .
	Aza hadn’t been the same since the whole Lightwarden and Emet-Selch business.
	“You forget yourself, Emet-Selch,” he said, looking down at me from the corner of his eyes.
	“We’re not going anywhere,” Hades said, and that was the end of that.
	It had been a satisfyingly productive day, one where Hades got to flex his Creation magics by constructing a brand new and modern building for the Bureau of Administration in only a handful of hours.
	“It is unlike you, Emet-Selch, to become so invested in a sundered being,” Elidibus noted in his usual monotone.
	“Hades,” Hythlodaeus rumbled, jolting the man to his senses, “pleasure them.
	Where’s Emet?” She asked, her throat feeling far more scratchy and dry than it ever should.
	Hythlodaeus set about the task of lovingly drying Azem’s skin and hair, delighting at the little gasping whimpers of pleasure escaping both them and Hades.
	And Zodiark… Hades thought, as (Y/N) swept into the room in another evening gown, this one of burgundy velvet, do I want to touch.
	“Go and be our salvation,” Emet-Selch says, his bloodied fingers touching those lips he only knew for one night.
	‘The best she has ever performed’,  was that not so?” Emet-Selch’s smile looks less mocking than Cassia would have expected.
	They rushed in and stopped next to Hades, who whirled on the doctor, his relief replaced with rage.
	Emet-Selch slides a second finger inside you alongside the first, slowly pumping them in and out, stretching your slick inner walls as you writhe and pant and moan, losing yourself in the pleasure both your Ascians are giving you.
	Hades always knew Prometheus had an ugly temper when it was roused, but he never really feared being hurt by him when he was angry.
	It had become obvious to Emet-Selch between his control over the Tower, the way in which aether and flesh alike had been grafted to it, and his distinct turns of phrase.
	Just by pure instinct I looked around the room, expecting to perhaps see Hades sitting at a desk and pouring over papers, already beginning his work so early in the morning while I’d slept.
	I watched Hades carefully as I pretended to read a book, his exhaustion becoming much more apparent as the hours passed.
	Azem raised an eyebrow at them, watching as Hades frantically rode Hythlodaeus’s length.
	Unable to break such a simple spell,” Emet taunted.
	“-̷̡̪̌͜-̸͇͔̻͈̦͎̯͔̏-̴̳̥̱̞̆̃̒̔̂́͋-̶͚̟͓̥͎̏̓͊̑͝-̶̛̫̼͍̗̭̗́͗̎͐̓̂͘͘͜͜-̵͙̱͉̤̱͛͐̊̏̍̒͝͠ͅ-̴̳͔̱̙̽͝," Emet-Selch crooned, his tone shifting into something placating,   “Refusing to contribute is not the answer.” “Your report stated that we have less than four weeks until it reaches Amaurot,”    Emet-Selch interrupted, his own tone growing short,   “We cannot debate and squabble over other potential solutions while the apocalypse is practically on our doorstep.” Emet-Selch had grown very still, and he felt anger - so much anger, bubbling in him, fizzing out, making it difficult to think straight.
	There was a hum behind us and I peered over my shoulder to find Emet-Selch stepping out of a miasma of purple and black.
	Last time Prometheus’s workshop was like this he had a runaway lava golem oozing over everything, and Hades ended up almost catching fire (not  an experience he wanted a repeat of).
	At some point, Emet had disappeared behind the curtains, and the lights began to dim on the stage and light up the crowds.
	“He’s somewhere out there still, Hades,” Hythlodaeus said quietly, knowing it to be true.
	There is something in Emet-Selch’s eyes that Cassia can’t place as he slowly gets up and takes a step closer.
	The song drifted to the background and Emet-Selchs's voice was loud once again.
	“Come,” Emet says, “Let's get you to bed before you somehow toss yourself to your doom.
	Hades didn't partake in it much, being far too lazy to waste his time manually assembling something he could simply use magic for (and also he was terrible at it).
	His hands are wonderfully cool, deceptively strong, and for an embarrassing moment, Emet-Selch is certain that Hythlodaeus must be able to feel his pulse quicken under the press of his thumb.
	"I do," Emet-Selch admitted.
	“Yes,” Hades looked out the window again, and for a moment, it looked as if his resolve to abandon Prometheus for now wavered… but then he looked away and clenched his hands.
	Hades scoffed.
	He is going to enjoy this in a way that may only compare to the first time he and Hades had pinned Azem between them.
	I don't know but I find it kinda sad that this entire chapter is virtually Aestelle talking with non-living recreations of the dead people she feels most guilty for their deaths all the while Emet is zonked out and still sleeping his days away lol like her finding it comforting to speak with the shades reminds me of Sasori from Naruto where he created his puppets in the image of his deceased parents to try and cure his loneliness ;-; Makes me wonder if in-game Emet went ham on recreating Amaurot and filling it with all of the Ancients and things as partially his way of coping with the loneliness and *okay now I'm making myself sad fuuuuu* Hades was floating nearby in the rift, watching her from the safety of the shadows but purposefully remaining close enough that she could sense him even in her fractured state.
	His limbs were as limp as soggy noodles, his soul so burnt out it couldn’t put up a fight when Hades cradled it, rippling through it with gentle undulating waves.
	“A shame, truly,” Elidibus mused, stepping forward, “I suppose that explains your topic of interest, as well?” Hades watched as he gestured to the new pile of books he’d placed upon the floor.
	I wasn’t going to return to the time I came from—a time where Emet-Selch was already dead and the Final Days hot on our heels.
	A semi-wet, fresh out of the shower Emet-Selch, mentions of combat-related blood and injury.
	Before she hit the ground, however, I saw Emet-Selch shoot across the sky from wherever he’d been to catch her.
	Some of them overlapped, or were crossed out and corrected in a cramped mess, and if Hades squinted and tilted his head far enough, he could sort of understand chunks of it.
	Hades won’t give up on him.
	Emet seemingly agreed with the ensemble.
	It was a low tone Emet-Selch hadn’t heard before, one that set him on edge.
	Even though Prometheus was isolated from rest of Amaurotine society, even though he had unpleasant rumours circulating him, even though he might be defective… it was easy to forget about all that when he stayed at Hades’s side, at Hythlodaeus’s side.
	Emet-Selch, Hythlodaeus, and in the middle Azem.
	Emet-Selch is a little taller still, somehow.
	“So you, too, merely wish to fight for a friend,” G’raha observed softly—a little too softly, it seemed, as the emotion in his voice only caused Emet-Selch to roll his eyes in distaste.
	“This is hardly a disappointment, Hades.
	Sometimes, Hythlodaeus couldn’t decide if Hades and Prometheus were made for each other, or  utterly incompatible.
	Hades knew.
	“The Warrior of Light does not deserve to hear her song,” Hades bit out the words bitterly.
	“The other Ascians,” Hades said, taking a step toward her, letting his fingers meet hers.
	She could almost taste his pleasure in the air as Hades started to move again.
	Hades and (Y/N) spend the night together.
	(Y/N) stared at Hades, and her mouth opened as if she was going to say something, but then she pulled her hand from his, and stood.
	“Zodiark’s tempering was something I escaped…Emet and the other’s, on the other hand, were not so fortunate.” “A city that which you and Emet-Selch both wish for us to see, I’m guessing?” She asked to which the younger girl flashed her a bright, seemingly innocent smile in response.
	There's no doubt that the Hades she sees stumble into the clearing is the real one.
	Prometheus would be embarrassed, but Hades will be kind for once and not tease him for it.
	Hades asked, remembering that night where Prometheus, shaking amd blank with terrified shock, had whispered of 'something  inside  him'.
	He cannot manage anger at Emet-Selch's deception - at least, not yet - so he takes advantage while there’s still time.
	“That’s not your name, dear boy,” Hades croons.
	“In their defense, it was I who told Urianger of the Eighth Umbral Calamity and unintentionally planted the seeds that only by Emet-Selch’s death could the First and the Source be spared into his mind.
	Azem’s attention turned to Hythlodaeus and Emet-Selch.
	“Next time you do it then,” Hades growled.
	When she turns to look up at Emet-Selch, helplessly confused, she finds him looking at her with something akin to expectation.
	Their souls quickly moved in tandem, until  Valstrax  was solid and unbending, the ultimate defence, bolstered by the harmony between his and Hades’s souls, as the Primal rampaged futilely against the unmoving barrier.
	“-̷̡̪̌͜-̸͇͔̻͈̦͎̯͔̏-̴̳̥̱̞̆̃̒̔̂́͋-̶͚̟͓̥͎̏̓͊̑͝-̶̛̫̼͍̗̭̗́͗̎͐̓̂͘͘͜͜-̵͙̱͉̤̱͛͐̊̏̍̒͝͠ͅ-̴̳͔̱̙̽͝,”    Emet-Selch tried.
	Emet-Selch let that half smirk remain plastered proudly on his lips.
	Hades had been reluctant to do something like ‘write a song’.
	“As for the rest of you, I’m sure you don’t need me to point out that you would need much more than a third eye before you could walk unnoticed in Garlemald,” Emet-Selch addressed the rest of the room then, his smile darkening as he looked between them all, imploring.
	It feels good; you’re too tired and sore for intense arousal, but it’s still extremely pleasurable to be so completely filled and stretched nearly to your limit, to feel Emet-Selch moving in you, his hard shaft gliding against your inner walls.
	Emet-Selch fit in so much easier into a crowd, and yet-- The second, more awful, realization hits then, that Emet-Selch had, in truth, revealed himself  deliberately  to Altruoix.
	As the door swung shut behind him, Emet-Selch sensed the weak force of Azem’s magic in the air moving it, though there was no sign of them as they entered the apartment.
	How is she ever going to get Hades and her friends to see eye to eye on anything when this is how they act towards one another..?
	“I told you to keep it down.” When her eyes returned to Hades, he bit the inside of his cheek to keep from commenting on the red-rims around her eyes.
	Azem walked around the side of the bed closest to Hythlodaeus, arching an eyebrow as he thrust hard into Hades one last time, throwing his head back as he savored his release.
	His and Helios’s thrusts fall into step and Hades is very aware of how badly he’ll ache tomorrow, but he doesn’t care.
	Urianger turned a page in his text, “I, again, would expect no less of thee to fight it.” Hades swallowed his retort, making to pull himself from the bed.
	Since they first arrived in Rak’tika, Hades had clung to the shadows so she didn’t need to worry too much about her unchecked aether.
	“For the  love of-”  Hades snarled, snatching the stupid banana from Prometheus’s hand, “If I eat this will you  leave me alone?”  Prometheus leaned back, his hip resting against the edge of Hades desk with a self-satisfied smile.
	Hades didn’t want to leave him alone.
	He took the elevator, holding the Exarch just so, so that the wound, and the blood, was covered by the Exarch’s red silk and Emet’s inky black coat.
	"Emet-Selch, please," you murmur, gasping in need as you spur him on, only for his hand to shift once more, this time in a way that makes you yelp as his touch on your clit becomes so painfully direct it makes you want to flinch away.
	With his other options exhausted, that left waiting to see what Emet-Selch meant to do next.
	Azem wiggled around in bed, and Emet-Selch stiffened, getting ready to hold them down if they thought about getting up.
	“Ah, that’d be a terrible fate indeed,” Prometheus drawled, “To have the esteemed Emet-Selch wait on me, hand and foot, out of concern for my health.” Prometheus had been dreadfully ill, but stubborn about it, and Hades had resorted to Extreme Measures.
	As if it could be rejected, Hades thought exasperatedly.
	With Emet-Selch's voice rumbling low in her ears, she shakes from release as she shouts out her pleasure, tightly wrapped around his name.
	“Emet-Selch-!” Azem’s voice called after him.
	Hades went to touch Venat.
	“Hmm.” Emet-Selch dropped his hand back down, finally heading out, already running through what he would do to take care of Azem.
	The sound had nearly knocked the rest of the water from the vase on the table, given how hard Hades had jumped into it, but it’d also, thankfully, sent the guard and medics in after.
	He came into his mouth with a shout, “Emet—!” clutching at the man’s hair from beneath his robes, tears at the edges of his eyes as he released onto his waiting tongue and lips.
	You are quite busy as the venerable Emet-Selch,” Hythlodaeus said with a smile.
	“Are you…” Azem took a moment to regain their breath, then sat up, Hades’s come dripping down their chest and abs.
	“What?” Emet-Selch asks, in that tone that sounds innocent and painfully suspicious at the same time, with wide eyes of disbelief, as though he can’t imagine there’s any reason you would doubt him.
	It is difficult indeed to tell the detempering worked or not, for Emet-Selch’s rage has not subsided.
	In this fic, Prometheus, Hades and Hythlodaeus are like, equivalent to 10 - 11 year olds, just, really smart by our standards 10 - 11 year olds.
	“That reminds me, you’ve never met Emet have you?” When Feo Ul unintentionally becomes the highlight of the entire chapter lul whoops rip Hades and Granson o7 I love me the pixies xD I hope this chapter wasn't too terrible to get through!
	Their desperate cries of pleasure filling the air as they filled Hades with yet another load of their hot release.
	“Don’t tease him, Hades,” she chastises.
	Hades has to understand that the souls of the sacrificed belong to Zodiark and the fractured beings they once called their friends will never be as they used to should they be made whole again.
	“To bring you to  Him  ,” Emet-Selch finally says, something of the hardness she saw in his eyes before back on his face.
	Hades sighs deeply and rubs his forehead.
	Leaving Fanow behind, Aestelle took her time in making it to the spot she knows Hades’ lamp will inevitably lead her to.
	Now that he thought on it, Hades did recognize some of the elemental colors in her aetheric imbuement.
	“I’m glad.” Emet-Selch arches a brow at you, and you wink at him, you precious thing, “I do love talking to you.” Emet-Selch swallows because he sees as soon as you point it out.
	Emet and WoL are consenting adults in a healthy, and mostly open relationship.
	It drives Emet-Selch up a wall, almost literally too, for he’s close to escaping every single damn time you even take a step towards his general direction.
	“Another Ascian might join our ranks, and it stays just your business, Emet-Selch?” Even as they stared at one another, Elidibus in gripes with what Emet might have been insinuating, time would not yield.
	I looked to Emet-Selch then, and he frowned at me in a mixture of disbelief and true rage.
	Hades turns his head with a scowl, “Of course it can.” He then glances away once more with a sigh.
	Join me, or die.” Hades said, lowering one of his more normal hands towards her.
	“It’s fine,” Hades said honestly, smirking up at his embarrassed friend, “You lasted, oh, a few more seconds that I thought you would…” “Hades!” Prometheus huffed, bristling like an offended kitten, “As if you would have done any better!” Prometheus attempted to smother him with his own pillow, and after an  incredibly  childish tussle that was utterly unbefitting of two well respected members of the Convocation, they both sprawled out side by side on the bed, Hades dozy but content.
	But I thought ‘what if Hythlodaeus had to face Emet’s absolute heartbreak of seeing Azem is dead and not vaguely missing?’ So this is the origin of that concept.
	It had all happened so fast; Hythlodaeus refusing the post, Emet-Selch – the former Emet-Selch, searching for a replacement.
	…Emet-Selch spent a rather large amount of time in your presence, actually.
	Despite her saying it was a good balance, however, Emet-Selch still couldn’t help but watch stiffly each and every time she doubled over in pain and clutched her head, claiming afterwards it hadn’t been nearly as bad as it had seemed, especially for the amount of memories she’d gotten back in return.
	Not that he has a chance to, because Emet-Selch shoos him through the doorway, past the bedroom study and into the bathroom before he can even get a look at his surroundings any further.
	A few hours later, as dawn approached, Hades put the finishing touches on his handiwork.
	By his third orgasm, Emet-Selch realizes the need is not going to abate.
	The check never came, and Emet quickly moved to her side of the table and offered her his hand.
	She doesn’t dare to turn back and look, but she can hear Emet closing and locking the door for her as if he lived here.
	Emet-Selch and Hythlodaeus each took a window seat, while I sat next to Hythlodaeus.
	Hydaelyn’s strike sent a hail of pale blue bolts down upon the population, shattering them, in a great wave of unmaking that seemed to rush towards Emet-Selch.
	Hades simply smiled, leaning against his kitchen door frame as his friend turned away from him with his nose in the air.
	Hades jolted, nearly dropping his book, upon feeling claws gently caressing his length.
	Of course Hades would never be sure, having been lost of his own will, thoughts, for so long, but now…now he hoped in a small, perverse part of himself that that was indeed the case.
	Hades stood there in his arrogant and nonchalant manner just as he did when he first made himself known to her and her friends.
	He feels the moment Emet-Selch himself sees it; a shudder of revulsion and surprise rippling through the other man's aether in sharp, jagged peaks and pitfalls.
	"Our dear little pet," Emet-Selch purrs out, and Lahabrea chuckles.
	I have to find Emet-Selch.” You say slowly, watching as the shade seems to fret, blank eyes darting about.
	“So have there been other Emet-Selchs?”  Upon my movement, Emet-Selch quickly sat up next to me, his breath heavy and uneven.
	Hades basked in it like he’d bask in the sunlight during his naps.
	Hades’s breath is just as shaken, if not moreso as he haltingly dips his mouth from yours and, for the longest time, he simply rests his damp forehead against your brow with hands nestled into your hair, now in repose but unwilling to let go.
	I opened my mouth to argue, but Hades grabbed my wrist to stop me.
	Hades sighs, but there is, much to his chagrin, a smile tugging at the corner of his lips.
	Hades had never shown himself before he went to save Y’shtola from the Lifestream after they revealed the path leading into the Qitana Ravel so what is he doing here now?
	You shiver at the cold touch of the lotion, but it slowly warms as Emet’s hands move, pressing and exploring softly.
	Oh...I also have a random dance RP conversation/story I’ve fleshed out with IRL D’ve, which involves Emilia/Hades and D’ve/Urianger...would you guys maybe like a little sauce to hold you over before it happens here?
	Hades clenched his jaw.
	Hades really is a terrible influence on her.
	“Damn it,” Hades muttered, pivoting on his heel and striding out of his friend’s workshop.
	“It will hardly surprise you to learn I am here for the drink, rather than your company,” Emet-Selch sighed dramatically, tilting his head up to polish the final dregs of his second glass.
	This is sort of a tie-in with the WoL from “Reflection”, who spends a lot of time talking to Emet-Selch about philosophy, morals, motivations, etc.
	As my conflict warred inside of me, the conversation around me continued, though Hades tried to send me assurances over the bond.
	He did not understand how he could enjoy it, loathed the flicker of disappointment when Emet-Selch slowed or shifted to remove touch from here, squeeze there, pulled ever more deeply from the well of pleasure he seemed intent on drawing dry.
	As he continued to watch, Hades confirmed it; something was…covering the sheen of the hero’s soul, like a shade or a curtain.
	Hades chuckled, looking down to her, “Need I truly answer that, hero?” Hades returned his gaze to her.
	“I am Emet-Selch, the Ascian who founded the Garlean Empire.” Emet-Selch has proven time and time again that his word is his bond.”   Hades, this is more than the dress,  she insisted, looking up at me as we stepped off the final step to the intermediate landing.
	“What’s happened to her?” the young male Elezen asked at once, shooting to his feet, his eyes only on her in worry, rather than on Emet-Selch in accusation.
	“Hades, could you pull the bread out?” “Emet-Sel-” I pursed my lips as I made my way to my seat, Emet-Selch not far behind me.
	It was hard for her to grasp the sudden realization that Hades, her beloved Hades who had vowed to love her and only her for the rest of their days, was betrothed to another and even had a child with this other mystery woman.
	Emet made this perfect recreation of our home and you should learn about who Lahabrea, Igeyorhm, and Nabriales were, not remember them in their worst moments.” “Alright, now that that’s taken care of, on behalf of the Convocation allow me to officially welcome you to Amaurot, mine and Emet’s lost home.” She said and then wandered into the lift.
	When Emet-Selch pauses for breath, he keeps her close, their foreheads touching as their breath mingles.
	As he reached the various landings, Hades could feel his cheeks beginning to warm.
	Emet-Selch chuckles slightly as he once again lets his hand wander lower.
	Emet-Selch doesn’t know if he hates it, or loves it.
	“Good boy,” Hythlodaeus praised quietly, before closing the distance and pressing his lips to Hades’s.
	“He has a point, Hades.” What say you, Emet-Selch?”  When I woke in the morning, before the sun, my backside was still flush against Hades’ body, his arms holding me tightly to him.
	Hades has always been a champion of Zodiark’s will, but even he knew that their dream is a hollow one at best.
	“They stopped,” Hades answered breathlessly.
	That was the last time Hades would see you before the Summoning.
	Emet-Selch stepped towards G'raha, lips pressed into a thin line.
	Hades was just here, for a moment at least.
	I always try to make even the more filler chapters have meaning or reveal something so that they're not pointless and I tried to do that here as well but I dunno, lately I've been feeling a bit down on my writing and questioning if it's any good xD Don't mind me though because now we're getting to the true good part of "can Aestelle save Hades or is she just going to die?"
	Hades frowned and nudged him in the side with his elbow.
	“Make me,” she both demands and dares, and Emet-Selch’s eyes spark deviously.
	And, since it was their idea, they couldn’t rightly complain about it later when Hades inevitably gave in to lust at the office.
	Hades sighs.
	Hythlodaeus grasped Hades by the chin, drawing him upwards.
	“I am sorry, friends,” she said, nodding sadly, then locked eyes with Hades.
	“I-I’m trying it’s just…” Azem panted, their hips jerking in answer to Hades’s spasms on the other end.
	Hades rolled his eyes at her and then looked to the elezen.
	Emet-Selch wasn't sure what angered him more, the idea of another man putting hands on his wife for pleasure, or violence.
	It was times like this, though, when Prometheus was keenly aware of how isolated he was when Hades and Hythlodaeus weren’t available.
	Still, Hades answers with your name, lips shaping the sound into the nape of your neck, and it feels right, so very ordinary to hear him speak it.
	Hades was surprised to feel a strange tension leave him as well, at her acceptance of the unknown.
	Dark purple spikes stabbed through her wings and kept her pinned against the stone, Hades’ staring down at her with a scarily blank expression.
	You collected your aether with a deep breath, and whisked yourself away to Amaurot, full glad that Hades had the good graces to give its reflection an aetheryte plaza.
	Hades is going to shoot the Exarch to put an end to his plans─actually shoot the man.
	“If it’s all the same to you, I’m going to bring Emet back to stay in my suite within the Pendants and then I’ll come back here to talk with everyone.” Emet isn’t physically hurt and he’d just be taking up a bed that could be used for someone who needs it.
	“And, even in matters not concerning Emet-Selch, but simply Hades, it is no burden to me should you ever need rely on my capabilities, as Azem or otherwise.” Emet-Selch looked as though the stench of rotten food permeated through the air as he balked at his friend.
	Hades would let you down easy, he wasn’t  that  cruel.
	Emet-Selch watches the way his lover's eyes widen in surprise.
	Later that night, I was awoken suddenly to Hades saying my name in the pitch black of our room.
	Emet-Selch clicks his tongue.
	A low chuckle escaped Hythlodaeus as Azem gave Hades precisely what he asked for.
	“...don’t be an idiot,” Hades finally said, “There’s nothing to fix about you, except your terrible timekeeping, and no  armiger  will do that for you.”  “You don’t deal with it anyway,” Hades sighed, but his tense shoulders were slowly relaxing as the topic shifted from less emotionally dangerous waters, “That’s what we get for spoiling you as kids, I suppose.”  “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Hades sniffed, “Now stop distracting me and come here.
	Be warned, there are scenes of self harm in the selections containing Hades awakenings.
	“Blasted bureaucracy,” Hades muttered, crossing his arms over his chest, “All that time wasted looking for you, for  no reason  .”  Hades hesitated, so Prometheus turned his attention back to the lake.
	Emet-Selch had told her to be bold, after all.
	“But I would also very much like to have my treat now, should you permit it.” The innocent pout that she wore set Emet-Selch’s cock twitching in response, and a low growl rumbled in his throat.
	“You complete, utter, beautiful fool,” he mutters, and with an echoing snap, Emet-Selch absconds with the Warrior of Light.
	But because of how both her and Hades tried desperately to save Amaurot, the few gods who have been watching over them decided to grant them their aid and turned back the hands of time.
	Hades could almost chuckle—if it was a Lightwarden, no one else but their Champion could hope to face it down, be it her soul could even handle that wealth of Light anymore.
	As Hades brought the last men of the unit he’d left in Castrum Centri home, he stumbled upon Seneca van Sergius.
	“Emet-Selch?” “Emet-Selch answers to a higher power.” “Just… Please try to be careful, Emet-Selch.”  A moment later, Emet-Selch came through as well, landing above me with both hands on the bed on either side of my head.
	Hades closed his eyes and braced himself for the vertigo that would come upon his reawakening.
	When Hythlodaeus holds Emet-Selch’s face between his hands you decide to turn around and look away, feeling your heart about to burst.
	“Why did you come, if not for knowing this was the end?” Emet-Selch asks her.
	Some might call you overprepared, but 'experienced' is preferable and using another overfamiliar magick - oh how Igeyorhm would fuss if she knew how many of its ilk you are privy to, Hades still worries about your every outing -  twining its balm with the fire, each tendril a salving lick over skin and muscle.
	For now ensure that the staff are prepared for the extra burden, and put plans in train for a formal welcoming luncheon.” (Y/N) looked up at Hades, and something flickered in the back of her eyes.
	By the time evening came around, Hades was irritable, hungry, and eager to talk.
	“You want me to fetch them?” Hades inquired, uncertain.
	After this day, it doesn’t come as a surprise that Emet-Selch is right there when she closes the door behind her, waiting for her.
	The Viera sisters, Runar, Ryne, Thancred, Urianger, and…Emet-Selch—they all sat looking at her, a question on their faces.
	Hades shuddered.
	Hades stopped immediately at the noise, the anticipation that had been building inside me leaving instantly, frustration taking its place.
	He did not think any evening could approach the shame he felt when he took himself in hand and thought of Emet-Selch.
	Hades had to take a moment to actually  process  that because he honestly couldn’t believe Prometheus was proposing what he was, “You’re  planning  on us all dying?” “Yeah,” Prometheus snapped his fingers, and Hades almost jumped with a staticy, faded illusion of their star sprung up between them, “But look-” “Prometheus,” Hades interrupted, beginning to feel alarmed, “I don’t think you should-” Hades went stiff, nervous despite himself at Prometheus’s wild-eyed expression, the way his aether suddenly crackled with violent intent.
	Hades sighed.
	"You're more feral than usual this year," Hades hisses when he breaks for air.
	It’s Emet-Selch’s reaction.
	“You….your name is Hades,” he said.
	“Whatever the plan is, it’s clear he hasn’t deviated, or else Emet-Selch would be… he would…” “Look at her, Emet-Selch.
	Aestelle glanced to Hades at the sound of his voice that had taken on an annoyed lilt.
	She has to remind herself that they’re shades, mere creations being used with Hades as their puppeteer.
	Emet-Selch did not withdraw, did not pump into him but stayed hilted to the hip, that appendage writhing to apply a rhythmic and precise pressure instead.
	When he thought I was steady enough, Hythlodaeus released my arm and rushed forwards with Lahabrea, but when they got close, a barrier sprang up around Hades, the Father forcing him to keep his friends at a distance.
	Hades watched as the hero leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms atop her chest.
	And, as always, before his knees hit the stone underneath him, Hades caught him by gripping under his arms and easing him down.
	The white button down is surprisingly unstained by the greenery, prim and pressed as if it were a day in the office, but  unlike  at work the fabric hangs open to offer a mouth watering view of Hades's leanly muscled chest.
	Like can you imagine how next chapter is going to go when Aestelle and him go to speak with Gaius and Raubahn like fjkldas;jfk And god forbid the Black Wolf recognizes Emet or he says something stupid to give away that yup, he's the late Emperor and an Ascian to top things off :') Emet is going to get himself killed confirmed.
	"Hades."
	“Right to it, are we?” Hades mocked, scowling as he readjusted his back to the chair behind him.
	“ Your outright dismissal of certain themes suggests a view colored by cynicism’,” Emet-Selch quotes one of her paragraphs.
	“The real us.” Hades repeated as he began walking after her with a small smile ghosting over his lips.
	“Then you think that you do not deserve to be saved?” Hades asks, in a mournful voice that tugs at your heartstrings.
	Him, Emet-Selch, Angel of Truth, collapsed in the face of mere disappointment.
	“But I never learn,” Prometheus joked croakily, unable to hold back a smile when Hades levelled him with an unimpressed look, “With you always cleaning up after me.” I spoil you too much,” Hades said, but he didn’t remove his hand, and neither did he stop the comforting wave of healing magic, gently urging him back towards his workshop, “I won’t always be around to look after you, you know.
	“Hades,” she said, her voice a delicate purr, and he spread apart his fingers and opened one eye to see her push the lace tops down slowly, watching him for his reaction.
	“They should’ve known better,” Hades said shortly, and he physically nudged Prometheus with his elbow, “Oh, stop moping.
	She still doesn’t quite understand why Hades would give a part of himself to her so readily after they’ve only just met in this timeline.
	“And honestly… I’m a little mad at you, Emet-Selch.
	It never helps that Hades’ coping mechanism is emotionally distancing himself from the hard parts of it all.
	Emet’s gaze was dark and troubled, brows knitted as if deep in thought.
	Cassia can see Emet-Selch’s eyes leave the book for a moment to run over her appreciatively before he goes back to reading.
	“Is there even a need to speak to me, when you have already taken it upon yourself to claim a front-row seat in the audience?” Emet-Selch curled his lip, his anger only growing as he continued to go through all of what Elidibus must have seen over the past two days.
	I don’t know who to trust anymore or how to help Hades.
	”  Hades groaned.
	“More?” Emet-Selch crosses his arms in front of him as he gives her a curious look.
	No matter how significant her worries and how potent her dread of the impossible things he told her were, from the moment Emet-Selch touched her, she could feel them drift away almost forcefully as his kiss and his touch demanded her full attention.
	Emet-Selch’s voice makes you jump, realizing that you’d zoned out during his lecture.
	“Luckily, I’m a very  generous  captor…” Hades purred.
	Both of them and, Emet-Selch imagines, must smell like him, too.
	When he first hears the call of Elidibus pulling him from the slumber he shares with Emet-Selch, Hythlodaeus has the same trouble as always.
	“Emet-“  With a wave of his hand, Emet retreats outside and disappears into the dark vehicle parked along the side of her apartment.
	Emet-Selch looked back down to me, taking in my barely-clad body for a moment, amusement in his eyes.
	Hades followed (Y/N) through the halls, his hand clutched in hers, past his bedroom door, and up to the top of the staircase, which ended in a door.
	Vaguely visible and obscured by shadows from the corner of your eye, a smile plays at Emet-Selch’s lips.
	Like, when Hades had that cold, his aether was all sluggish and bleh.”  “You were told correctly,” she said, carefully circling to the main issue she wanted to confront all along, “Did Hades or Hythlodaeus tell you that?”  She hoped Hades and Hythlodaeus wouldn’t tease him overly much.
	I heard Ryne gasp and the wooden cup in Emet-Selch’s hand clatter to the floor.
	“As you are spending the day with me, we could very well leave the illustrious Emet-Selch to sleep in as I’m sure he would prefer.
	Hades and Gaius and the others are nearby and will come to her soon enough.
	Emet calls Lahabrea "old man" in Japanese and, after the short story from SE, I'm convinced he got that from Hythlodaeus.
	Hades started at him flatly, “Prom.
	Reaching between them, he grasped their cock just under the head, while Hades’s hand shifted lower.
	“But I really thought you and I were closer than this, Emet-Selch.
	“Graduating with honors?” Hythlodaeus whispered, and Hades realized at that moment that Hythlodaeus saw the same—that, in fact, he wasn’t misreading.
	Hades’s face was almost entirely red.
	“Ah…” Emet-Selch says, his voice sounding much more understanding all of a sudden, and Cassia finds her curiosity piqued.
	Instead, he focused on his task at hand - Hades.
	ALSO, next week is my exam week (where I have 7 exams in a week ending with a 4-hour one on Friday), so the Emet-Selch/Hades chapters may have a more sporadic schedule throughout the day but I will try my best to post them!
	Emet allowed himself to close his eyes for the briefest moment, lulling in the sensation of her tongue around him, albeit inexperienced as she were.
	Hades was leaning back in a bath in his room, staring up at the ceiling, when Elidibus appeared.
	The dampeners that rested beneath the strings side-stepped all at once, releasing their grip from the strings and allowing the notes Hades pressed to vibrate freely, ringing for more than twice the worth they'd been before.
	His vision shifted, and Emet-Selch could see a pale blue flicker of aether -- the shadow of its creator -- clinging to the wax, and he pursed his lips in distaste.
	Only  his, too, since he presumed only Emet-Selch would’ve known about this place.
	Perhaps another time would be best for your questions.” Hades could feel himself trying to building up his own aether, despite the fact that he yet had the control, or ability, to wield it.
	The gentle touch contrasts with the forceful tug to the side before their lips are meeting, his tongue claiming Hades’s like it belongs to him- and it does, doesn’t it?
	Emet Selch draws in a shuddering breath, quieting for now.
	Emet-Selch’s voice that is usually so scathing and harsh sounds a good bit warmer and more inviting as he reads.
	That particular wave which both men knew so well and all color drained from Emet-Selch’s cheeks.
	And I cannot explain why,” admitted Hythlodaeus as his lips teased a sharp jawline in a trail up to Emet-Selch’s earlobe.
	“…she was the one who struck me down.” It takes a moment for Emet-Selch to understand.
	It rolled, well past the rim of her plate and over, stopping against the edge of Hades’ own with a gentle, wet “plop.” Her eyes widened, the blush present before now deepening on her cheeks.
	“It doesn’t have to be a prison, Hades.
	He could have rightfully stayed in the First and avoided Emet-Selch if what he had hoped for was privacy, so Hades suspected that was not what he wanted.
	Thrusting ever so measuredly in a rhythm that, to Emet-Selch’s torturous delight, matched the way in which Aeliana swallowed him far past the roof of her mouth after once more switching her focus between them.
	The last touch was Emet-Selch's own idea, adding the same climbing jasmine vines that had adorned her father's house - he hoped it would make [FN] feel more at home here.
	I could feel my heartbeat pickup and I was immediately prompted by Hades, despite my anger at him earlier.
	12 | promise » Emet → Azem, implied F!WoL/G'raha, 2.3k, T.to tell someone one will certainly do, give, or arrange something.
	Gaius never tore his eyes away from Hades even as he reluctantly released his hold on the hilt of his gunblade.
	“I don’t know, Hades,” says Asteria, leaning too close for comfort.
	It hurts to think that this is where Hades wants to die, in these very ruins.
	“Hythlodaeus said that Emet told you about my memories so I thought it would be obvious to you three that I wouldn’t be able to kill him.” Lightly brushing through Hades’ hair, Aestelle looked down at Hades with a troubled expression.
	It is too new, too unexplored, but the possibilities Emet-Selch offers seem so endlessly tempting.
	With all obstacles now out of the way, Hades snapped his fingers - his robe vanished off his body, leaving him in his loose undershirt and shorts instead - and rudely invaded his bed.
	“Well,” Hades said after a very long, tense pause, “I can say with absolute certainty I would never  willingly  fight you.” “It’d be too much effort,” Hades said honestly, reaching up to gently tug on Prometheus’s dark hair, curling the dark lock around his finger, “And I’d lose.
	Clenching her soaked cunt to quell her desires as Emet-Selch’s fingers fluttered a trail up across her chest to lay a palm around her throat, a gentle amount of pressure applied by his thumb that caressed her jugular.
	The Scions had told him Emet had become unstable after he and Emilia’s exchange in the Ocular, that it was best he would be accompanied if seeing him—seemed he was much like Emilia in that respect; like teacher like student.
	"Yes, just like that," Hades coaxes.
	“It is also Emet-Selch.
	I felt Hades’ mind shift at His offer to spare me, and I shook my head violently, trying to force myself forward, trying to tell him  no  , but I only ended up leaning on my hands and knees, gasping for breath as my head pulsed, my vision beginning to fade around the edges, the pain in my chest returning as my soulmate, desperate to keep me from this battle, let himself be manipulated.
	Hades drew in a sharp gasp.
	Hades came up on the girl’s other side as we started heading back to Ishgard and to the Lord Commander’s office.
	“She’s like to lose a hand,” Emet-Selch bit out through gritted teeth, and the look in his eyes betrayed a level of concern that Hythlodaeus didn’t seem to share.
	The Great Sundering claimed mine and Emet’s home just as he’s told you twice now.
	The one named Emet-Selch is requested upon the Source.
	Hades chuckled.
	She casts a single Gravity into the air where Thancred was moving quickly towards Hades, knocking him away and throwing him onto the ground where the rest of their friends have already appeared.
	Hades’ smirk only widened.
	Hades presses kisses into your skin as easily as prayers, his soul hums with a hymn at contact with your own, he pours and pours and pours of his being unto your own, relentless in desire and a familiar sinful wish to mark his god as his own.
	Hades rolled his eyes and went back to his Concept notes.
	Hades gave him a heavy-lidded stare.
	Elidibus had said he wanted her distracted, that he considered Emet-Selch a fair price to remove the Warrior of Light from this game of Rejoinings.
	Emet-Selch makes a noise somewhere between a grumble and a click of his tongue.
	“A cute lizard person,” Hythlodaeus agrees, finally snuggling into Hades.
	Hades has come for her at last, sending an excited shiver down her spine while her stomach seizes in terror.
	“No, I’m fine,” Hades snapped, making a shooing gesture at him, “Go on.
	Emet-Selch affected a noncommittal shrug.
	Hades watched as the Scions slowly began to filter from the room, leaving one by one until he, the seer, and the Astrologian were all that remained.
	This is our best bet.” Hades sighed, defeated, and nodded his head.
	Hades growled as he looked into his palms, biting back the words he wanted to yell at himself.
	“This!” Emet-Selch nearly shoves the papers in her face.
	Hythlodaeus took the opportunity to do just as Emet-Selch implied would happen if they were not accommodating: he pretended to leave and took note of the Warrior’s room.
	“Go ahead,” Hades said blandly, unbothered.
	Hades focused upon it.
	“Hades,” she whispered, “It’s all right.
	“That remains to be seen,” Hades answered, though he looked rather unhappy about it.
	For once in his life, he obeys, and Hades feels himself tear up as the fingers are replaced by a second blunt head pressing against him.
	“And then there was Amaurot…” Emilia could hear Emet-Selch’s voice reverberating in her head, melancholy yet proud, “Never was a city more magnificent.
	I have a reason for befriending Emet and I’ll explain everything to you and the others when the time is right.
	An eternity of grief and disappointment lifts just enough to see the sun beneath the blackened pall that has sat over Hades since the Sundering.
	“For a story with no true villains, there sure is a lot of victims…” Aestelle muttered to herself, Hades walking painfully slow towards her.
	Whether to solidly prove a point or because he had grown weary from not getting his hands dirty enough during the Third Astral Era, Emet-Selch thrust himself wholly into the forefront of the effort for the Sixth.
	“Oh, do not give me this betrayed look,” Emet-Selch scoffs.
	Before she could shut him out one last time, Emet pulled a manuscript through the rift.
	Emet-Selch considered retorting, but realised he didn’t quite  hate himself that much yet to get into a petty argument with this pathetic shade of his old friend.
	The book sits carefully in her pocket wherever she goes, together with Emet-Selch’s notes so she can go through both them and the book at the same time.
	It made Emet-Selch tired.
	Her arms are bound in the same aether as Hades’ own.
	Prometheus’s aether fluttered, and Hades chuckled when the curtains sharply closed of their own volition, blocking out the light.
	“You are running, Emet-Selch.” “Emet -“ “Emet-Selch.” In this place he is not Emet-Selch.
	He filed the observations away, hopping up onto the armchair next to Hades’s.
	Hades watched as the Warrior of Light’s eyes dropped, roaming back to her cleaver with a look mixed somewhere between disgust and annoyance.
	Hades pushed aside his plate and glass as he leaned back in his chair, stretching his legs beneath the table.
	whispered G'raha, not meeting Emet-Selch's eyes.
	That they would lay their cards so bare may only prove to benefit us,” Y’shtola hummed, looking over to both me and Emet-Selch.
	Attention drifted away from him and to Hades, whose legs suddenly shifted wider.
	‘I’m sorry, Hades,’  she whispers quietly to herself as she closes her eyes.
	I hope you all enjoyed School days with Professor Emet-Selch!
	Repeating the gesture with the other hand Emet-Selch and Hythlodaeus appear, also bound in a similar fashion.
	“You stared at his buttocks for five minutes straight,” Hythlodaeus finished ruthlessly as Prometheus moaned in mortification, hiding his burning face in his hands again, “How Hades missed it, I have no idea.
	From : Elidibus <  elidibus@convo.am  > To : Altima <  altima@convo.am  >, Deudalaphon <  deudalaphon@convo.am  >, Elidibus <  elidibus@convo.am  >, Emet-Selch <  emetselch@convo.am  >, Emmerololth <  emmerololth@convo.am  >, Fandaniel <  fandaniel@convo.am  >, Halmarut <  halmarut@convo.am  >, Igeyorhm <  igeyorhm@convo.am  >, Loghrif <  loghrif@convo.am  >, Mitron <  mitron@convo.am  >, Nabriales <  nabriales@convo.am  >, Pashtarot <  pashtarot@convo.am  >, 14th <  14@convo.am  > Subject : Friendly Reminder (again)  Hades was the one who threw me out the window!
	Emet-Selch raised an eyebrow.
	“And soon an exit to match, if she continues to be so careless,” Emet-Selch snapped, and although my eyes were closed, I imagined him shaking his head, or pinching the bridge of his nose.
	Many people greet Emet-Selch as they pass, and though a few try to stop him for a chat he politely declines claiming he has urgent business.
	Can I not give you and Emet a present at the same time?
	"No," Emet-Selch set his jaw.
	It made Hades  wonder  if, perhaps, Icarus had an ulterior motive that wasn’t simply attraction.
	As if reading my mind, Emet-Selch handed me a cup of water after a quick snap, and I took it greedily, chugging it in only a few gulps.
	It was only after Hythlodaeus had pointed out that Akademia Anyder had its share of dangers that Emet-Selch relented under the condition that he hold onto her weapon.
	How they wished to pump into something, yet they couldn’t even compose themselves enough to rock their hips against Hades’s ministrations.
	Hades was unable to voice his anger, his frustration.
	It is in the time between the seconds Emet-Selch is not near that you get to read over these tomes, trying to find out anything at all about who you are.
	Hythlodaeus moved his hands from Emet-Selch’s hips, reaching around him to grasp at the hem of Azem’s robe and tug.
	Hades didn’t seem particularly taken with their lodgings either, “I think I’ve come to a decision regarding that offer of yours.” “Mm,” Hades lifted his arms up in a lazy, lazy,  lazy  stretch, his spine audibly popping as he actually straightened the damn thing for the first time in decades, “You mentioned a thermal bath…?” “I don’t  ache,” Hades grumbled, slouching heavily once more as he dropped his stretch, “But I am  exhausted  after walking through this city like a  pleb.” Hades gave him a look that could peel paint, “I’m very much  unaccustomed  to walking that far.
	He eased Hades off him again, lifting the man into the air with his tendrils, a sadistic smile spreading across his face as he watched Hades writhe in anticipation.
	With a sigh Emet-Selch looks over at Thaumas, “Yes, she is.” He technically doesn’t state which of them she belongs to, but as he is the one who said, it leaves no room for argument.
	“Nngh… Hades may have snuck away from his duties…” Azem shuddered, gnawing their lower lip as they tried to regain their composure.
	But he shows thanks all the same, the prideful man, and for once in a long, long, time, Emet-Selch feels as though his colleague is not entirely lost.
	“Emet is my…” What is Hades to her and what is she to him?
	Sorry to say it Emet, but I think you’re stuck with us now and forevermore!” She very nearly sang as she walked with a newfound skip in her step.
	"Don't you worry, my dear hero," Emet-Selch says, sounding somehow both soothing and mildly patronizing.
	It was strange, but Hades supposed being close to the hero, her shard, filled him with nostalgia he and Persephone’s days in the Akademia—staying up into the late hours of morning studying, creating, calculation or debating over common ideas or concepts they hoped to execute in class.
	Gradually, he met that rhythm with his own thrusting, and noted there was an unusual lack of give to his throat -- the crystal, it must be, he thought -- but the Exarch was so damned accommodating for that, swallowing his cock without hesitation or struggle as Emet-Selch climbed closer and closer to the edge of release, eyes darting between the twin displays of sheer eroticism before him.
	Her heart fell in her chest as she looked at Hades with nothing short of worry.
	It's short-lived, really, especially when Hythlodaeus moves first, his cock dragging over every single tortuously pleasurable inch of Emet-Selch's channel, pressed in tight quarters by Azem.
	He can’t have Hades.
	On display and facing Emet-Selch, with a knee wedged between her legs to part her thighs and provide his friend with a most intimate glimpse.
	“It’s…still hard to explain.” Hades watched as her mismatched locks fell over her shoulders, falling down into her face and eyes.
	Hythlodaeus coos at him, Helios grips his waist hard enough to bruise, but all Hades’s mind can process is his insides being crushed in the best of ways- The same relentlessness that endears some and infuriates most, but now Hades is grateful for it as Helios thrusts, hips pistoning inside him with little regard for comfort and focused solely on making Hades sing.
	Emet-Selch bares his teeth.
	We don’t know yet how we will make the trip to the shard and we should be prepared for anything.” Hades nodded his agreement as well and we went to board Eden.
	Her glasses fell to the ground and Hades caught a small glimpse of her blind eyes before she shut them.
	“Hades,” I said, grinning as the twin’s eyes widened and her jaw dropped.
	Emet-Selch raises his brows as he puts the book down and looks at her.
	He’d been open to this prospect; over the course of their journey on the First, Emet-Selch had divulged all of which he could, more or less at the expense of his own life.
	“Are you quite certain of that, my dear?” Emet-Selch asks, tugging at the button once more before he undoes it.
	If Prometheus visited on those days, he would always mischievously shift the window by slow, careful inches just to watch Hades follow the sun rays across the floor until he ended up pressed against the wall.
	“Perhaps,”  Emet-Selch says thoughtfully.
	Your breath goes faster as Emet-Selch pushes his entire hand slowly but steadily against your soaked cunt.
	And while Emet-Selch had adjusted her height somewhat, she still seemed to be shorter than the average Amaurotine.
	Hades took a moment to even out his breathing (  running  was so plebeian, honestly), carefully scanning his surroundings.
	“How is it that you travel from shard to shard, Emet-Selch?” the male twin asked and I glanced back over my shoulder at him.
	"Hades, you were right!
	Emet-Selch’s lips curl up into a mocking smile.
	With his announcement made, Hades sat in the chair behind him.
	The thing was, Hades didn’t have a particular role to play in this.
	Emet-Selch slides out fully, adding a second finger, and Azem writhes between them, her lips moving from Elidibus to Emet-Selch.
	To your consternation Emet-Selch’s usual smirk returns at the same moment that a third tentacle brushes between your legs, the slippery length of it sliding against your sex beneath the water, and you’re not sure whether it’s relief or disappointment you feel when he does nothing else with the odd appendage.
	If they did, they made no comment as Emet walked passed the shades of his neighbors into the apartment.
	“If the only reason you’ve come is to chide me over my choices and test my patience, you’ve done what you’ve sought to do.” Hades hissed.
	In the aftermath, you lie along the mussed sheets, curled in Hades’s arms and you wish it to never end.
	Emet-Selch.
	After Eulmore, she’ll be a Lightwarden in all but name and until she fights Hades, there will be nothing but that cursed blinding light yet again.
	“Is still sick,” Hades confirmed, “But Zodiark will soon revitalise the land and restore it to how it once was.
	Hythlodaeus was right, loving Hades makes her blind and do the dumbest of things sometimes.
	Hades nipped his bottom lip again.
	Not as Emet-Selch lowered himself between her legs and she felt his tongue drag a delicious trail through her slit that caused her to moan instantly.
	Hades looked down at her, a frown tugging on the corners of his lips, his shoulders falling.
	If you wish not to giveth-” Urianger started but Emet-Selch just snapped his fingers and the Exarch immediately shifted.
	You look again at Emet-Selch and Elidibus, enraptured in their lovemaking, twined together by passion and emotion as much as by intimate physical joining, their quiet sounds of pleasure and desire making your heart ache to be included.
	Hades cried as she stepped into the glowing portal, a reverberation of glass ringing in both his ears and chest as she disappeared within its radiance.
	“How rude,” Hades hummed, not sounding offended in the slightest as he reached out to idly play with Prometheus’s hair, “I’m not up to anything.
	Emet-Selch came to me, seeking another way.
	My beloved Hades, I’ll protect you…” “Knew of your plans to kill Emet?” She asked in return.
	Hades gave him a deeply unimpressed look.
	Hades rolls over to regard him, “You haven’t been a ‘guest’ here in eons.” Hades' eyes roll up toward the ceiling.
	Emet explained this to her comrades, who in turn gathered to the Exarch regarding this matter, who then, in turn, deemed it a cause necessary of their time and efforts.
	A couple of short pumps is all Hades managed before he released into her.
	"I'm fine, Hades.
	What hast been done cannot be undone, mine actions wrongfully carried out, but I do beg leave to return to thy side and aid thee in thine quest to save Emet-Selch.
	But if Emet-Selch knew, in his heart of hearts, that He would have disapproved, then the stain on his soul would have surely stopped him in his place, no?
	“I for one will place my trust in Emet-Selch.
	"That, my dear, depends on what exactly you want my help with,"  Emet-Selch says with a terribly inviting tone.
	You can't stop fighting, but still, you crumble before Hades' unrelenting onslaught.
	Hythlodaeus shifted, looming over Hades, and began to stroke into him, watching as he continued to service Azem as if he was trying to get them off before either of them finished.
	Where everyone else goes out of their way to anticipate your needs in the kindest way possible, Emet-Selch doesn't seem to care about them at all, yet you undeniably need what he offers.
	“Hades.” “Hades!” she begged, “I want— I want you—“ Hades moved her, admiring how she was so pliant and willing in his arms, turning her on her side, settling behind her.
	Hades made to respond, but Alphinaud interjected, “I-I don’t think that’s a good idea, he-” Hades crossed his arms, shaking his head.
	She looks toward the past, where Emet-Selch white hair and all too golden eyes glares her direcion.
	“That the first Emet-Selch created Xerora to simulate different governments?” Hades said, “Yes, I’ve heard of that one.
	Emet-Selch's bare cock twitched in the cooler air of the chamber, and the Exarch took a small bottle from next to the lounge -- a gift from Emet-Selch, because they were enemies, he'd said, not savages -- and poured the glistening contents onto the tips of his crystalline fingers, spreading it until they were coated.
	“I’ll find a way to wake you, my beloved Hades… I promise...” This chapter hurt to write xD Hades and Elidibus got me hard in the feels and just :'))) These next few chapters are going to at the very least send me on an emotional rollercoaster lul I'm also writing and rewriting them a lot because I want them to be *just right* and they aren't coming out exactly how I want them to ;-; determination will win out or so help me god I'm going to go level gnb to 80 instead of blm xD because obviously she'd leave if they tried to murder Hades lmaO I was going to rewrite it too but then I thought about it more and something kind of clicked as to why my brain would write them with those reactions (because I really just write whatever comes to mind and don't think ahead much to any.
	“This is the worst map I’ve ever seen,” Hades said flatly, eyeing the laminated paper Prometheus had laid out flat against the cafe table with open distaste, “Why is everything in neon colours?” Hades sighed, slouching deeper in his seat.
	“Oh Hades, you are so compassionate and generous,” she had whispered into his ear as she was close, those lips that had grazed his skin remaining within a whisper of him.
	When she lost Ardbert right before her fight with Hades, it didn’t truly sink in until much later that he was truly gone and wouldn’t be able to have conversations like these with her anymore.
	Sheathed in mortal flesh, Emet-Selch slouched onward, dragging ragged and barely-conscious G'raha by his collar behind him.
	“Those mocking words were meant for me.” He says, and Emet-Selch realizes as soon as he says it that they were.
	In their eyes, killing Emet is the surefire way to save the First since they also don't know about Elidibus eventually coming to stir up trouble.
	“Let us return to Emet-Selch’s home, then.” Emet-Selch opens his mouth to protest but one look from Hythlodaeus silences him.
	“You  want  to keep mixing the two?” Hades asked curiously.
	When she said, “It’s excellent, thank you,” to the servant, Hades realized he’d been holding his breath.
	“Were you good for your Father while I was away?” she asks, and Hades catches her eyes peeking over the top of the boy’s platinum hair.
	“Exactly!” Azem laughed, earning a small smirk from Emet-Selch as well, which, to her, always felt like an accomplishment no matter how many times she’d achieved it.
	Forcing Emet-Selch, Hythlodaeus, and Aeliana to cease the game they’d been playing with one another in favor of giving pursuit.
	“Hades…” She said his name at nothing above a whisper.
	“Despite his many protestations, I never quite believed Emet-Selch was telling the truth.” “Aestelle, do you...do you wish for the same as Emet and the other Ascians?” But what Emet and the others are attempting to do isn’t ever going to restore our home.
	Countless reincarnations of the woman I love dying for the very false beings that would never do the same for her...and you think I wouldn’t end this cycle if given the means to free you?” Hades scoffed.
	Hades barely knew what went into their construction, and that wasn’t getting into the fact that Prometheus was the only person to ever successfully construct one anyways.
	At that, Emet-Selch lets out a genuine laugh.
	“And you,” Y’shtola started again, looking towards Emet-Selch once more.
	In the grip of his fury and indignity, G'raha bit down as well, tasted blood on his teeth as Emet-Selch inhaled sharply and, to G'raha's chagrin, pressed upon him ever more hungrily.
	The next time they had their encounter, Emet smirked and pressed his hand back against the spine of a book so that it slotted back into its place on the shelf.
	Hades swallowed and pushed down the irritation he felt building in his chest.
	Upon seeing Hades contending with a stubborn group of scholars (and sounding increasingly grumpy about it), he sighed and shook his head, coming to a slow stop beside Prometheus.
	Emet pulled her to him now, nowhere to escape.
	It slips from Hades to himself, tearing his belly open.
	He really was hot, and restless, and Hades kept  touching him, lightly, innocently, but suggestive enough that it was making him  horny.
	Hades gazed through the hole in the roof up at the stars above: they were utterly unfamiliar, different constellations than what he had always seen in Amaurot and studied at the Akadaemia.
	He hears the stuttered growl beneath Emet-Selch's breath over Vala's moan and the slap of flesh against flesh.
	“So bold are we to do that in public?” Emet asks airily, “What of it Elidibus?
	“Listen,” she starts slowly, “I know I said some harsh things to you when I found out it was Emet-Selch you’ve been talking to.
	This is for Hades too  , she tells herself.
	Hades refuses to look at them - if he gives these two the barest hint of attention, he’s not finishing this project tonight - but can’t help but drawl out, “You knew what you were getting yourself into, getting Azem of all people as a mentor.” Helios cuts his eyes at him, which Hades only notices from the ripple of annoyance in his aether.
	“Like you insisted that you could fix all of our woes before the Final Days?” Hades cut her off, crossing his arms over his chest as his smile turns more wry than anything.
	“There’s something I want to go see for myself before we confront Emet in the Capitol.
	Though he does not deign to respond, in a final show of an utter lack of professionalism, her voice echoes after him, "You're awfully moody, Emet-Selch!
	Tell me, most eminent Emet-Selch, what is the purpose of my seat, if when it comes to the outside, none of you will consider what I have to say?” Hades sighs, rubbing his temple.
	It’s barely a heartbeat before Hades is coming, fully this time, painting Hythlodaeus’s chest in white and screaming himself hoarse.
	Hades hesitated but nodded again—he had yet to see her fight hand-to-hand.
	Emet grinned and snapped his fingers—an orb of light appeared, dancing about his palm gently.
	“Better?” Hades asked him after he recovered.
	Elidibus might have been on the mark about his impatience, but one would think Emet-Selch, the Architect, to be the  most  patient man around.
	"Prometheus," Hades returned, turning round.
	Prom was sprawled out, flushed and grinning, clearly happy, and Hades found most of his annoyance spluttering out.
	Emet-Selch shrugged his arms out and looked at us, as if that were all the proof we needed to see that they had clearly become the best of friends.
	You stayed put, mind traversing several different subjects at once, but Hades woke less than a bell after you.
	“Now, you were wondering why Emet-Selch joined the Convocation?” Up ahead in the distance, Emet-Selch rode the aether currents to guide the charybdis and Hythlodaeus couldn’t help but smile.
	Hades was bound by duty to his brethren and his world.
	The Night’s Blessed looked to where Hades was previously standing with nothing short of fear and shock.
	Hades could only imagine the pleasure he would find there, and he did so, greedily, clutching her in his arms and thrusting into her tight grip.
	Hades sighed.
	An excited whimper escaped Hades as he rushed to please, bending himself over and giving Hythlodaeus full view of his ass as he reached back and grasped the toy by the base.
	Emet-Selch’s expression tightens, his lips pressed together in a thin line.
	“I…by the star….” Hythlodaeus panted against Hades’s mouth.
	Emet-Selch is by far the taller of the two and his shoulders broader, in keeping with the Garlean appearance he has taken, but both men are lean and toned, with chiseled musculature.
	Although Emet-Selch had been expecting Elidibus to approach him once he’d returned to the Rift, he hadn’t expected him to already be standing there—and by all rights, waiting for him.
	“Do you really think Lahabrea will be able to help?” she asks Emet-Selch as they walk down the halls that he knows like the back of his hand.
	Azem bit their lower lip, watching Hades writhe beneath them at the thought.
	Emet-Selch found the Crystal Exarch in a moment of vulnerability—hunched in his study with a bottle of wine over a tome recalling the stories of the Warrior of Light.
	“How did—” Emet-Selch clicked his tongue, straightening himself to his full height.
	Before I even had time to register going into the portal, I was already stepping out of it, and Emet-Selch was already stepping away from me, gathering his hand from my back all too soon.
	“Do you want to see the fall of Amaurot on your watch?” Hades clenched his jaw, hand begrudgingly rising from his lap.
	“[I will always love you, Hades],” she said with a warm smile when I nodded.
	“Was that really so hard?” Hythlodaeus asked, planting his hands on Emet-Selch’s chest.
	You have staved off a Calamity and caught an Ascian - not just any Ascian, but Emet-Selch, the Architect - in your snare.
	Those words were the truths of the matter, if not in a more kind state than Emet-Selch had been wont to deliver.
	Emet-Selch remembers marrying her, watching her fall in love with him all over again; he remembers their fights and their joys and their children…  After a while, Emet-Selch had let his senses wander.
	Emet-Selch remained motionless in the dim of the room, watching for far too long as the Exarch slept.
	With all of the groundwork laid, Emet-Selch was now endeared to them more than he would be otherwise.
	The orange light of the early evening sun slanted in the windows by the time Hades finished speaking, and [FN] was still curled in on herself, weeping into the handkerchief he'd given her.
	Now though, after what Emet-Selch had done in his final moments, she seems a little more at ease using aether for the first time.
	You step back, looking at Emet-Selch as he taps an impatient foot on the ground.
	“E-Emet…Selch.” Hades sighed, “Your hero, her soul.
	I’ll make certain Hades is well, well taken care of…” Truly, it was a crime that the Convocation had given Azem time off but not Hades… Perhaps he could rectify that offense.
	(He had considered being offended… but then realised he essentially had a free holiday with Hades in  Xerora.
	With Hades there to help, defeating them was much easier than it had been before, but I knew that he would be heading back to the Crystarium before we finished to get a head start.
	“Whether I desire it or not, I will inevitably join her on her adventures regardless—the only difference being whether I leave with her at the start, or I am unceremoniously summoned into some ridiculous situation that she has deemed fit to involve me in.” Emet-Selch retorted.
	“W-while the gifts the two of you gave me are quite…quite…mmm… H-Hades, p-please—” Azem arched back as Hades slowly worked their cock in his hand, their breath coming in needy gasps.
	Emet behaved during the week.
	Hades is here and she believes he’ll spirit them away to a place far far away from this nightmare that was once their home.
	Hades took note of the chill, groaning inwardly at himself; both of his arms had been bolted to the wall, tethered by an odd, swirling expanse of reddened, aetheric metal.
	He had thought, in that moment, where Aza had been delirious and in agony, before Emet-Selch ruined the plan, that he had only imagined him gasping his name but… Of course, the emotional ‘reunion’ had to be cut short on account of still being in Emet-Selch’s apocalyptic illusion.
	“A bit on the nose, aren’t they?” Hades murmured teasingly, “I’m partial to Persephone, myself.” Hades left his friend to it, closing his eyes as Prometheus talked to himself about the steps to  armiger  forging.
	As you start to greedily suck your own taste off his fingers, Emet-Selch lets out a throaty moan.
	She’s at it’s mercy as she falls into a memory from the past long forgotten by all with the exception of herself and Hades.
	“Of course you can, baby,” I said, a smile spreading across my mouth and I leaned down to lift her into our bed as Hades pushed the quilt back.
	Hades scoffed next to me and crossed his arms over his chest.
	“That, or Mace didn’t notice a two inch high cleaning droid charging at his shins,” Hades said flatly.
	There are few people in the world he wants to be around less, and having an orgasm while a coworker was physically present, watching him – Hades is depraved, certainly, but he is not interested in anyone but you seeing him like that, not outside of the realm of fantasy.
	Hades set his jaw, “’Tis not in my best interest, as you may realize.” Hades loathed disarray, disorganization—he wanted to think through his strategies, the consequences and steps each would need, each would result.
	Hades watched as she tried to hide it, fail, then begin again with tears in the corners of her eyes.
	Hades lies reverent and rapt underneath you, and the wish seethes itself through your heart that you had not played pretend for so long.
	With a shrug, Hades flicked his gaze down to Aestelle for a moment before refocusing his attention on Thancred.
	In comparison to Prometheus who was surprisingly easy to soothe, Hades in a foul mood was a delicate task to handle even for Hythlodaeus.
	D’ve had meant what he said when he’d witnessed Emet-Selch’s return; enemy or no, he was glad Hydaelyn granted her that much.
	You heard the news about Hades becoming a member of the Convocation.
	“Hades,” she murmurs as she reaches for him.
	“I am getting  old  .” Emet-Selch chuckled.
	Hythlodaeus’s replica, on the other hand, had stiffened whilst Azem teased Hades.
	“That I have, Emet Selch,” he rouses, “Although, I had expected you to come alone as you usually would.” He returns the greeting with a press of his lips to her knuckles, an action that garners daggers from Emet’s eyes, but Aletheia reflexively bobs her head at the gesture.
	With one last flurry of stars shredding through him, Hades has no choice but to retreat into the darkness he himself has created, shielding himself from any more attacks.
	The only thing that remained the same—that remained familiar, was that I could hear his voice, could hear Emet-Selch speaking to somebody…Two people?
	“No one said you were, Emet.” She rounded.
	A calm silence fell around them as G’raha turned his attention back out the window while Aestelle kept her eyes fixated on Hades.
	“Perhaps…we should retire to the bedroom…” Hades managed, his breath coming in short gasps, thoughts threatening to melt under Azem’s taunting affections.
	Hades raised an eyebrow as he looked down at her, golden eyes taking her in.
	After everything the Ascians have done, Aestelle doesn’t blame her friends one bit for not wanting to necessarily give Hades a chance...but it hurts seeing those she cares for so openly hate the man she loves.
	And once they’re in the Eulmoran’s domain, Aestelle will have no time at all to look for a way to save Hades before both he and herself are whisked off to the Tempest.
	“Please, Hades.” Persephone was crying now, begging.
	“Then give me the truth.” Hades said as he took a step towards her.
	The idea of it, becoming a thrall to the Father, Zodiark, once more, even in the slightest, Hades could no longer chance—not now, not being aware of the things he has seen.
	Emet-Selch scoffs.
	Slowly, Hades slumped against her as he caught his breath, resting his forehead against her collarbone.
	Vaguely she was aware of Emet’s hands clasping hold of her shoulders, shaking her slightly, saying her title.
	How do you fare, Emet?” “I’m fine, hero.” Hades felt his jaw twitch, his voice strain.
	What an intriguing turn of events.” Hades said with a somber lilt to his words.
	“To be honest, I was more worried about Emet-Selch realizing than (Y/N).
	When Cassia looks back up, she notices Emet-Selch’s eyes have not left her, looking at her with a strange intensity before he softly shakes his head.
	“Not that it matters,” Emet-Selch murmurs, and he shakes his head before his eyes are on Cassia again.
	If I save Emet and Elidibus, the Ascian threat will fade away over time, our goal of bringing peace to all still being the outcome of me saving my beloved and dearest friend.
	Hades immediately steadied him, his hands grasping his arm, and then- ah, better.
	Scions, Crystarium and Exarch, they would live, Emilia was here to make sure of that, and so…would Emet, now.
	With your adventurous spirit and a nose for trouble?” Emet-Selch narrowed an eye on her, one that bespoke of challenge more than a critique.
	And yet Hades knew who she was and still chose to fight for their lost home...so does that mean even if she confirmed his suspicions and told him for certain she was his lover from when the world was whole, he would still choose to try and kill her and her comrades?
	Emet-Selch scolds.
	Her fingertips brush against his, their fingers intertwining as Hades lures her closer.
	Hades felt the anger crack through their shallow bond, tried very hard not to snap back.
	“Good morning, Emet-Selch,” I said, trying to keep my voice even as he straightened, then motioned towards one of the tables.
	The painfully loud thud that follows is absolutely the sound of Emet-Selch's forehead hitting the desk in the vain hope that more.. percussive maintenance will assist in getting him back on track with his looming paperwork.
	But he can tell Hades is panicking.
	He didn’t even care when Igeyorhm died right beside him─Igeyorhm, Hades.
	With a sigh and one last glance to the ground where Emet-Selch had been standing, I nodded and jogged over to them to help Y’shtola.
	Hades has to be nearby and if he’s still calling her name then she wants to stay quiet to listen for him.
	“I,” Hades is always so good for you, always mindful to warn in advance, “I am, going to…” Though you could pull back, the desperation of his hand clawing over your scalp, the pounding heartbeat and the tremors you feel wracking in his legs – Hades wants it, bad, so, so bad.
	Hades castled his own king and rook.
	Emet tilted his head, brow raised in expectancy.
	It was painfully amusing to observe the hostility between the Hyur and Exarch after his lecture, but Hades was grateful, in some regard.
	“If you’re up for it,” Prometheus said, and Hades knew if he said no, his friend would back off instantly.
	You knew and you said nothing, letting this burden pass to Hades while you sat in comfortable retirement.” “He always was able to see right through me in a way Hades never understood.
	“Hades!
	Hades could not dwell, lest his march be ever more difficult.
	“I know,” Hades murmured.
	He couldn’t fully recall the details, but Hades had gotten huffy about it, Prometheus had been a little too smug, and it resulted in a ten year cold shoulder that was thankfully never repeated.
	I had shrunk under the stares of the other officials also attending the performance, the rumor mill spinning around the room as Hades led me to our seats, where he regaled me with the tale of how this building came to exist- an accomplishment he held close to his heart.
	Hades felt his mouth twist into a broken smirk, “Boredom sometimes takes us in different manifestations, Astrologian.
	Hythlodaeus pulled Azem’s legs further apart, hooking them over his thighs, as Hades approached.
	Emet-Selch still holds her hand in his, lips brushing over her wrist again before he leaves a trail of gentle kisses along the soft skin of the inside of her lower arm.
	“I didn’t even know you were there,” she claims, trying to push the thoughts away, but Emet-Selch doesn’t let her.
	comes Emet-Selch's slightly resigned voice, pushing slowly through the fog that surrounds you.
	The door opens, and you wait for the one entering to announce themselves – but they do not, of course, because who would be approaching Emet-Selch’s personal office if they did not at least know the man already?
	"I can see," Emet-Selch murmurs, his voice low and almost a whisper, "a soul so brilliant, it made me look twice the first moment I saw you.
	Hades waved him off.
	Hades was just focused on Prometheus’s hand, stroking at his stomach and teasingly circling his navel, ruthlessly exploiting a very little known  sensitive spot  that had Hades feeling uncomfortably hot around the collar.
	I try to stay optimistic even when things aren’t going well so no one around me worries, and Hades could see right through my mask.
	Hades’s soul had a hole punched through it.
	“Emet-Selch.” Emet-Selch sat on a bench a few yalms away, watching me intently.
	It could have been frightening if it weren’t for the sense of completion Cassia feels when Emet-Selch’s mind is right there, inviting and welcoming her with his whole being.
	Hades must agree with you, as something churns in the space between just before he snaps a finger, leaving your bare skin chilled for a split second before wet heat swells at your sex in full and its intensity shreds a loud cry from you.
	She almost instinctively throws her head back, but the way Emet-Selch is still looking at her with burning eyes from between her legs makes her unable to even close her eyes.
	you mumble, and it causes Emet-Selch to let out an almost cruel sounding laugh.
	“Emet-Selch.” The greeting is stiff, even for Lahabrea.
	Will they?” Hades queried, looking up into her eyes.
	“Allow me to introduce you to Emet-Selch.
	Even Emet-Selch did not have that level of sight, though at times it came close.
	“The one and only─or were you hoping for Emet-Selch to have created a shade of some other member of the Convocation?” He asked, moving his hand forward a little closer to her.
	"My dearest, most honorable Emet-Selch, would you do the honors of taking us home?"
	Whatever Emet-Selch is doing is not painful at all, yet the intensity behind it scares her to no end.
	I am Emet-Selch.” He is quite familiar with Emet-Selch, whose end came once before alongside that of Gaius Baelsar, taken down together in the early days of the 8th Umbral Era.
	Emet-Selch looked out at their hesitant faces, and smiled.
	Emet-Selch retorts.
	Emet-Selch’s aether is persistent.
	But it was not Emet-Selch who had earned the Warrior of Light’s scorn.
	“I don’t think-” Hades began, but Prometheus had already whisked his example ‘Shoebill’ back into his inventory, and started ushering him out.
	Hades will stay with you if you wish it; he does so love his sleep.” Fortunately, Emet-Selch is having none of this; he places a soft kiss on the top of your head, shushing you, then lays you down on the bed and glides across the room to pull Elidibus into his embrace.
	Both Hythlodaeus and Emet-Selch stared at each other then, uncertain of what to say or do to stop her.
	Hades made an espresso.
	Remember me, Hades.
	Now, hm, I wonder if I can do the same kind of teleportations Emet and Elidibus use...” Hades and Elidibus and the other Ascians make it look so effortless to summon portals of their own...she’s going to have to practice before she can do this with as much ease as them.
	She hissed, an hour later, as she was thrown to the ground in the Menageries, at the feet of Emperor Solus zos Galvus, the Ascian known as Emet-Selch.
	Hades scoffed.
	Emet’s hand pulls your fist out of your mouth, twining your fingers with his.
	"Open up, hero," Emet-Selch demands, dragging the tip of his cock over your lips, leaving a few drops of moisture behind.
	So your precious Hades did occlude himself, and take that mask of Emet-Selch unto his heart.
	“Ah, they must be talking about you.” Hytholodeus jested and Emet-Selch let out a grumble.
	Hades gave him a flat look, but let it go.
	“Yes?” you say hesitantly, not entirely sure what you’re consenting to, but it becomes clear when Emet-Selch trails his gloved fingers from your ankle upwards to your thigh and the fabric covering your leg melts into shadow and disappears.
	If Hades has resorted to using his magic -- and she  knows  that he has -- then she has lost.
	Undoubtedly the man is cursing himself at this very moment, Emet-Selch considers, and then goes back to staring at you with feigned disinterest.
	Emet-Selch's breath caught, and for the first time in a very long time indeed he was rendered temporarily speechless.
	It’s obvious to him that Emet Selch had grown impatient, finding her within means when she’s the most vulnerable and impressionable.
	“Lahabrea lost his sanity; the ability to feel anything but contempt, Elidbus lost his memories; all he knew was his duty and Emet-Selch…” His morality?
	“I actually wondered if you would tell me more about the Convocation and how you became Emet-Selch.” Emet-Selch rolled his eyes at the two of them already so at ease with each other, but of course they would be.
	“(Y/N)!” At the Elezen’s echoing cry, Hades slammed the Armoire shut and buckled his belt.
	“How dare you,” Hades said, and his voice trembled with grief or with rage.
	Hades must have saved you somehow.
	“I would very much like to continue this discussion, but I am going to need to get up and get some warmer clothes, possibly make some tea, so if you wouldn’t mind?”  She looks pointedly to where he is still sitting on her bed and the brief look of confusion on Emet-Selch’s face is almost amusing before he realizes she needs him to move so she could get out of bed.
	Emet-Selch stepped forward, not bothering with a portal to pretend he hadn't been there all along.
	Hades’ expression was unusually somber, and so you let him continue, though you were determined to broach the subject at a later time.
	Hades rolls his eyes upward.
	A gasp escapes you through your nose, but you hear Hades cover it up with a slide of his hands over some papers on the desk.
	After a murmur of begrudging agreements, Emet-Selch smiled and, with all eyes on him, could not help his theatrical manner as he spread his arms out.
	After laying them on a nearby chaise and covering them with a blanket, he turned his devilish smile to the bound and painfully excited Hades.
	I sat upright in it, smoothing my hands over the sheets and twiddling my thumbs as I waited awkwardly, Emet-Selch observing from the wall across from the bed.
	"It's not right," Hades says softly as he gently wipes more of her tears away.
	I’d only taken a few steps out of the store, dress boxed and in a bag at my side, before Emet-Selch strode down the path and towards me.
	“Call me Emet-Selch or call me nothing at all.” He turns away, to the blasted hills beyond - to the land that he must somehow turn from rubble into an empire.
	Not particularly, but Prometheus did a lot of things Hades didn’t understand but still indulged him in.
	It was hard to focus on the memory when Emet-Selchs's betrayal still cut deep.
	Hades prompted me again, asking if I needed him to come.
	Hythlodaeus watched in disbelief as Hades straddled the groggy Azem and eased himself onto their length.
	Disappointment filled Emet-Selch’s face as he beheld me, something about my question making him struggle to keep his uncaring mask in place.
	A long life that should have not felt so for Emet-Selch, for he had lived a thousand thousand lifetimes and this one should have felt like all the rest—a small fleck of paint to the sweeping canvas.
	In concert they worked to fill her and each time that Emet-Selch hilted deep and held himself, Hythlodaeus would pump straight past her tongue to the back of her throat to let her gag around his size.
	“Hello, Emet-Selch!” She gave him a wave, tilting to the side and standing on one leg.
	Emet-Selch explained that he sought the Scions in the Crystarium after hearing of the deeds of Emilia, after witnessing their beginnings on the First.
	Emet just saved  Y’shtola.
	I w-wouldn’t do  anything  like that to- to Hades!” “Two weeks ago,” he said, “Hades met us for tea in his Convocation uniform, the black, form fitting one.
	But not from you, Hades.” Her eyes flutter shut.
	Altruoix supposes Emet-Selch knows better than anyone that he won’t be swayed from this path - and the man himself is far too stubborn to admit what his heart screams clear as day.
	Hades felt a frown etch upon his face; what was preoccupying her?
	“Emet-Selch,” The Speaker gestured to him, watching skeptically.
	One wrong move and Hades will die by her hands yet again.
	Hades laughed at himself, feeling so possessive over something as innocuous as her name, but it did not change his desire - he wanted the right to call her by her name, to call her (Y/N), stripped of all formality, to be his and his alone.
	They danced in silence, enjoying each other and the music for a time, before Hades spoke again.
	Emet-Selch says something she can’t comprehend to her friends before he turns them towards the portal, and Cassia clenches her eyes shut and buries her face against his coat before it swallows them whole.
	"I’ll come visit soon," you say, seeing Hythlodaeus waving and Emet-Selch looking at you with a genuine smile, one happier than the one you last saw in Ultima Thule.
	But Emet-Selch doesn’t sound wrathful.
	The book is decades old, and Cassia wonders just how long Emet-Selch had planned things ahead.
	“Surely only a ruse.” Emet-Selch huffed an indignant laugh.
	“Ah, do I hear the frustrations of someone who has to meet said expectations and doesn’t want to?”  Emet-Selch asks, still in an amused voice.
	As a member of the Convocation, the circle of great luminaries who had assented for the grisly offering, Hades found himself dead inside from the undertaking.
	“Only during their lessons here,” Hades said, “To give them an experienced perspective on all… this.” Hades wasn’t exactly a cold-hearted bastard, but he was rarely this considerate of absolute strangers either, even if they were one of the very precious few children of Amaurot.
	A sudden pang of nostalgia for those halcyon days.” Hades then said with a more somber lilt to his voice before taking on that emperor act once more, walking forward a few steps and lifting a hand to the air.
	If Emet-Selch could leap through time, there was little he would not know.
	Leaving Fordola outside the medical tent, Hades dragged (Y/N) into the command tent, barely waiting for the flap to close before he caught her lips with his, hungry again.
	“By the twelve you talk too much,” Thancred groaned, “he just was put to sleep.” Emet paused mid sentence and looked at the gunbreaker skeptically.
	While Hades leaned into the Ancient he didn't return the hug but he did certainly lean into it.
	now that we know emet-selch's true name is Hades, I wonder what Lahabrea's was?
	For Hades, Hythlodaeus had painted a long legged bird with a stern face appearing to be watching Azem climb and judge their abilities (Grumpy bird, Hyth had called it.
	“Come now, you are more to me than entertainment,” Emet said with a wave of his hand.
	But when Emet-Selch starts to move, something akin to panic rushes through you, and for a few seconds, you are not even sure what you fear more - that he might continue or that he will not, and you find yourself scrambling.
	Hades turned towards me again, his eyes glowing with that same dark light.
	I’m more than familiar with those who would rather avoid their burdens.” His eyes drift toward the door of Emet-Selch’s room, “And I am more than happy to lend an ear, if you find it something you’re able to share.” Emet-Selch hasn’t exactly warmed up to her, per se, but his snide remarks are starting to feel less barbed.
	Hades.
	If I was not on your side, I would have left you on that landing, drooling like a buffoon,” Emet tutted.
	It was never recorded, and Prometheus always gave him a weird look when he asked, so Hades chalked it up to the Convocation being overly cautious as per usual.
	The both of you have been brought before us accused of murder.” Hades’ hand slid over my leg, giving it a comforting squeeze as I bit my lip.
	She has a lot of emotional/memory luggage tied with all the people she's had to kill, witness dying, etc, and no matter the circumstances, she wouldn't have wanted the same for our dear Emet-Selch.
	Prometheus brightened, letting Hades feel his happiness from that agreement.
	The grip in your arms tightens again before Hythlodaeus gently places his hand on his his shoulder, pulling Emet-Selch back to his collected self.
	As a few of the children began to chuckle, Hades arranged himself with more than a twinge of annoyance, now towering up to his full height.
	Hades didn’t require any further encouragement.
	“Perhaps she doesn’t need to have sense talked into her, Emet-Selch,” he says, turning cyan eyes in Hades’ direction.
	Be it giving  or  receiving it, that was Emet-Selch’s favorite part of these dalliances.
	Hades's disbelief.
	Emet-Selch draws her forward, the energy binding her wrists responding to his will until her face is right before his own.
	In merely a second Elidibus had easily overpowered you, and had Hades not already been searching for him, you doubt you would be alive.
	Large hands grasp into your waist, your body slipping down steady against Hades.
	“As you are right now, it is,”  Emet-Selch says, sounding more leveled again.
	I've been thinking a lot about how their dynamic is going to change as more Ascians are brought into the story (our lord and savior Lahabread especially) and I'm getting more and more excited thinking about how I’m going to change up the msq storyline now that Emet is alive.
	“He just wanted to make birds,” Emet-Selch snarled out, despair making his voice thick, “Those silly, short-lived  insignificant  things!
	Emet huffed.
	Hades tutted, lifting a hand to poke Prometheus in the centre of his chest, “Now  that  isn’t very brave, is it?
	Hades smiled at the Lalafell, genuinely.
	Hades had waited for you, even then, waited to sleep until you returned, trusting that you would come back.
	“Emet is fine I suppose.
	When no response was forthcoming, Hythlodaeus reached down and took both Hades’s cock and his own in one hand, stroking them together at a slow pace as he studied his partner.
	After losing the first real family she ever had...it hurts too much to even entertain the idea that the Scions might be next in line to die in exchange for Hades being spared.
	Hades never replies to your long forgotten question, seemingly adrift in the moment as everything about his demeanor becomes more unhinged—a deep yearning to the way that he brings you into a kiss that flirts with fierce desperation.
	Prometheus growled something out, wanting to shake him unconscious, and Hades just  laughed, his eyes dark with a sultry kind of mischief as he tightened his grip and  stroked- “Hh,” Prometheus squeezed his eyes shut, arching as much as he could, abs clenching as Hades found a  lovely  rhythm, stroking him firm, fast, rubbing gently at the tip, making Prometheus tip his head back and whimper as he felt himself about to- -and Hades eased off instantly, squeezing the base of his cock until the feeling passed.
	I never thought I’d say this, but I’m on Team Ascian and want to see Emet freed from his lonely existence.” We have watched thee across the time of numerous lives, the son of souls, that which thee and thine call Hades, hast ever guided thee towards this ending to fates plan.” “I don’t understand… Who is Astraea and why call Hades the son of souls?
	Emet-Selch narrows his eyes while Hythlodaeus outright cackles, looking like he's enjoying every second of it.
	Emet-Selch makes no move, his full lips parting as you slant yours over his.
	No one can tell if the blood on his face is from Altruoix’s wounds or if he’s actually managed to injure Emet-Selch.
	Emet-Selch expects your annoyance, your frustrated claims of deception, and perhaps he even expects a tiny measure of heartfelt pleading.
	In a way Hythlodaeus thought it was appropriate, Hades was wont to separate himself from her in a matter of self defense.
	His knees were shaking, he wanted to lie down - he wanted Hades, two very strong desires that can be accomplished at once, “M’gonna, fall over, sofa…” Hades laughed, quietly, fondly, but he obeyed Prometheus’s jumbled up plea.
	But there’s a thrill he can’t deny in the idea of doing it in his office, in the office of Emet-Selch, where he receives the occasional visitor and is accustomed to working diligently on papers and academic reports and the like.
	“I promised I’d save you, didn’t I?” Emet-Selch says, his smile unable to cover the regret in his voice.
	He wishes to be alone, and we—” Emet-Selch glowered when she interrupted him a second time and he had to bite back the urge to reprimand her on the spot.
	Hades pulled back into the maze of aether and forcefully pulled an orb out of the Scion’s network.
	But he had his answer and so did Emet-Selch.
	Emet-Selch’s smile widens as he asks, “So, what was your favorite part then?” “Is it offending your sensibilities, my dear?” Emet-Selch asks, managing to sound only mildly patronizing.
	“The morning before we married.” Hades replied.
	Despite a few minor transgressions, Emet-Selch has no objections to his joining the Convocation.
	“How archaic and utterly boring,”  Emet-Selch scoffs at that moment.
	Until then, she can only hope Elidibus doesn’t get himself into too much trouble with Zenos or Varis while her and Hades are busy here on the First… “About Hades?” She had never thought about leaving the Scions, though in truth she hasn’t exactly thought much about what she’ll do in the future after she’s saved Hades and Elidibus.
	Hades stood up, staring down at her with his lips set in a firm line.
	Clear skies with a few clouds roll by greeting them as Hades slowly releases her from his embrace in favor of grabbing her hand and interlacing their fingers as he too takes in the change in scenery.
	I looked to Hades again, who looked incredibly put-out by the doctor’s words.
	Emet’s cheeks are alight warmth, and you feel your own pulse booming thunderously through your veins.
	“It’s killing him, he never would have had a hope to contain such aetheric corruption.” Hades frowned.
	“Do not tell me what she would and would not do.” Hades cut him off with a bite to his words.
	"Don’t you think so, Hades?"
	The only pressing matters she has is to decide whether to return to Elpis, or to Emet-Selch.
	Cuz highkey I want to write Hades and Elidibus' reactions to Fandaniel, Mitron, Zenos, and literally all the hell that's about to come xD)  There just barely managing to lift away the large chunks of fallen stone from over his legs was her beloved Hades, his long snow-white hair such a contrast to his onyx black robes as he struggled to free himself from the collapsed building.
	Emet said he didn’t have access to his powers anymore, deprived of Zodiark and resurrected by Hydaelyn—how was it still standing, then?
	Hades hissed out.
	The cold distance between herself and Emet-Selch had been comfortable enough that she had tentatively allowed bits and pieces of self to be exposed.
	He can't with Hades or Hyperion without their help, but her?
	"Emet-Selch.
	Emet-Selch had not appeared, not muddled since they spoke in the orchard.
	A lazy, confident little tilt to his lips that never failed to irritate and hypnotise Hades in equal measure.
	Hades stared at her for a moment longer, watching as she once again always has her attention turned upwards to the heavens, to the future.
	Then what will we do after that Hades?
	Emet-Selch scrunched up his nose in distate.
	“...can I talk to you now?” Hades asked with feigned lightness, as if nothing was wrong, “Or am I still banned from speaking?” “I think…” Hades started carefully, “You should rest for the next few days.
	It was for a new extension on the Administration building, and with the climate slowly warming as their star entered its hot cycle, Hades was incorporating a windcatcher in its design.
	Aza had started to figure out the pattern to it, after all: an event relevant to him, combined with a powerful surge of emotions attached to it… Emet-Selch had been pinging the flags for it for a while, and the long delay in the Echo vision had started to make Aza suspicious that the Ascian was just spouting pure shite to make him seem more sympathetic.
	“Do you mean me and Emet-Selch?” You ask, watching as he frantically shakes his head.
	She turned her gaze from Hades and back to the flickering fire.
	“Some of us are born with particular affinities, Hades, as I’m sure you’re aware.” He closes his tome with a smile, casting it aside.
	Please, just wake up Hades.
	You think Emet-Selch has had enough of it for a lifetime.
	Prometheus’s breathing evened out, and he squeezed Hades’s hand tight.
	With great interest, Hythlodaeus watched as Azem tried to thrust against it, only for Hades to move with the motion and refuse them their desire.
	(Emet-Selch x WoL x Hythlodaeus) When Emet-Selch begins to notice that his two closest companions are spending more and more time together, he resolutely tells himself that he will remain unbothered.
	It didn’t allow for a lot of time to scurry into the dusty archives where Hades sat, but Prometheus still made sure to visit as often as his breaks allowed - usually with a brand new idea for a feathered friend to bounce off of him.
	I could sense Hades’ discomfort and annoyance at the girl and he clenched his jaw.
	Brilliant blue eyes locked onto his gold, gleaming, “ Emet-Selch,” She bowed as he moved to kneel before her.
	The Ascian Emet-Selch does not fall to your cunning ways or your awesome power or your pretty Auracite.
	Perhaps your time would have been utilized better.” Emet-Selch swirls a crystal wineglass with a careful rock of his wrist, the scarlet liquid lapping the rim, but not a drop spilling.
	Hades dropped one hand down between their bodies and lightly brushed her clit, matching his strokes.
	Emet-Selch and FemAmaurotineWoL welcome a new addition to their family.
	An afterthought buzzes at the back of your mind as you pull away from Emet-Selch; his lips had been so close, and you are sure he was not the only one breaching the breadth of space.
	Uh hey this was not supposed to turn into what it did I would like a refund, please stop having Emet reminisce about EVERYTHING when he’s with WoL I’d like to write regular romance/fluff/smut please So we get Hades/WoL instead, at Anyder together.
	Ah, Hythlodaeus was honestly a miracle worker, able to temper even Hades’s mercurial moods.
	“Prithee, may I take’st a moment of thine time, Emet-Selch?” Hades turned, surprised to find the Astrologian standing in his doorway.
	And he doesn’t: his calloused hand closes around Hades’s cock at the same time he finally, finally lets the spell fizzle out.
	“Is no one going to get over that” Emet-Selch exclaims.
	Shaking her head, she hugged Hades as tightly as she could, closing her eyes while her aether begins to glow and pulse around her.
	“Did your plans go awry?” That caused Emet-Selch to finally turn, looking at where Mitron had his hand on Azem’s shoulder with a concerned frown.
	Hades swallowed his nerves as he descended the staircase, his fists clenching in anxious, feverous è̴̛͎̬̰̥̯̖͛̌͑̀́̃̿̀x̵͉̗̝̥̹̣͈̲̖̅̐̈́̑́̉͋͋̄c̷̖̣͙̰̊̀̀̂̚ī̸͎̐͋͝t̶͚̱͊̔͗̎͐̎̏́͝ẽ̸̙̳̤̣̖̖̦̇́̎̍̒͆̐͘͝m̵͓͙͚̙̫͇̪͉͋ë̶̡̧͈̖͇̗́̈́͗͊̾͂̀͜͝ͅn̴͉͔͎̗͉̂̅̃ẗ̴̞̬̳̞̦̺́̐̍̓̅̀̂͛͊͝.̴̟͚͖͓̺̯̤͗ The woman’s eyes watched him, him ȧ̶̬͖͙̲̩̺̦̘̳̆̎̃̉̅ṅ̵̳͑̀̂͂d̷̬̩̯͖̤̽͗͗͒̔̃͋̚̕ ̸̧̱̘̪͓̫̻̬̟̊͐̓̓̿̈́͊ͅǫ̵̮̟̘̼͆̎͌̍́͒͘ǹ̶̤̩͈̱̗̰̉̚͜͝ͅl̸̼̳̹͕͗ỹ̸̧̘͙͙̟̠̜̤̳̈́͋͗̂̈́̋ ̵̝̻̣̤̣̏̓̌̆̐̍̿͝h̴̛̛̠̰̤̟̙̠͕͌͆̽̏̄̽̕͘i̷̟͉̗̥̟̘̎m̸̢̫̹͓̲̞̞̱̔̀͆͂̽̄̚͜, as he approached her landing.
	Hades had expected to be ended - but he yet lived, and he was not being tortured, or humiliated, or any other gruesome options that sprang to his mind.
	Emet-Selch finds himself rather impressed as she goes limp and breathless in his paramour's arms.
	“Yes,” Hades said slowly, then, “Prometheus, are you even breathing?” “I’m breathing, I- no, uh, let me, let me say something first,” he said, when Hades moved to speak, “I know you’ve read that and I just wanted you to know, but I don’t expect anything and if you want to stay as friends it’s really fine and I understand and I’m really sorry for forcing my feelings on you-” “Prometheus,” Hades cut in, very gently, “Breathe.” Why would Hades look at him and think ‘ah, yes, I love that’.
	Emet-Selch does not beg.
	Hades glanced from his Concept manuscript to where Prometheus was leaning against his sofa on the floor, fiddling with some overly complex Rubix cube.
	“She will see the merit of Lord Zodiark’s ways,” he said with an intensity that begot the eons of suffering he had endured alongside Hades.
	“You made quite a mess,” Hades murmured, catching his eye with a smirk, “Look at this.” His stomach was coated with smears of precum and tiny spurts of release from his near-orgasms, Hades gently and carefully mopping it up before banishing the soiled cloth to wherever it came from.
	Her hold on Hades’ hand tightened the moment she noticed he was about to say something about her being used yet again.
	Emet wondered who had put the Exarch back in his outfit and why it was so important to keep himself hidden, but it was a thought for another day.
	A pretty long chapter full of nothing but dialogue but I swear it's important for the story to keep going xD Next chapter I promise to give some wholesome Emet time (don't ask me how I'll manage this because I haven't thought that far ahead but so help me god I want more Emet lol) On the bright side, Aestelle is kinda okay with the Scions again and Elidibus is soon to really join in on the mayhem that is this fic so don't get too used to this chill somber vibes.
	Once again, Cassia feels torn about every single one of her feelings, and Emet-Selch seems determined to not make it any easier for her as he pulls her close enough to let his lips brush over hers.
	If that Emet-Selch character and you really were lovers way back in the day, then he wouldn’t want you to die for him.
	With a firm grip Emet-Selch took G'raha's length into his hands and began to work him to hardness with deft and skillful gestures.
	Hades learns many things about love, from loving you, over and over.
	“Very well then,” said Emet-Selch while his warm hand roamed up the back of Aeliana’s thighs and dipped in between, firmly cupping her slickening folds.
	“Gracing us with your presence today, are you, Ascian?” Thancred bit out as Emet-Selch slid into the seat across from me.
	Hades took in a deep breath, remembering how soft, fragrant, her hair had felt wrapped in his hands.
	If you'd love to have more stories to read, come join us at Emet-Selch's Book Club, a wonderful community of authors and readers!
	Emet-Selch was not a man, a being, above using his strength to make you...behave.
	Words fall from his lips that he barely understands his saying, even with the Echo, slurred enough that if Emet-Selch just pretends, as best he can, then he might be able to imagine they’re not words of endearments, sweet nothings, pleading and begging for you to – Anything, Emet-Selch thinks to himself as he falls asleep.
	We both know that Emet will need you to be there for him when he awakes and Elidibus is no better.
	After a moment you made to step back again, but Hades simply pressed you closer to him, cradling your head against his clawed hand and pressing his forehead against yours.
	And if there has been no progress in detempering the followers of the lesser primals, then how is she supposed to rescue Hades from Zodiark’s grasp when He’s one of the two oldest primals in existence?
	For the first time since the Final Days, Emet felt himself wavering.
	From his station, Hades could see the small smile at Elidibus’ lips, the pride, and it, too, fed to his own.
	Unlike Fandaniel who was stubbornly trying to get close to her at every given opportunity, Nabriales took the approach of using her to further his work instead which Hades and Elidibus and even Lahabrea and Igeyorhm all took issue with─but not her.
	Hades rounded, “You’ll what, hero?” As the group ascended the stairs, Hades could spot some of the Scions standing atop, cloaked and wrapped in their own winter-like clothing.
	Hades felt Olivier’s hands grip him - Zodiark, he is unusually strong, - and tear him away from (Y/N), who raised a hand to her mouth in shock as he was pulled across the room, and set on his feet.
	She’s failing miserably at not drawing suspicion just as Hades is failing at truly befriending her companions.
	Still kneeling, he eases closer and Elidibus spreads his legs to accommodate Emet-Selch’s hips, welcoming him with a soft exhalation of pleasure as he slowly pushes inside, easing in with gentle little thrusts until he’s buried to the hilt in his lover’s ass.
	Hades shuddered, fingers curling around his dick as he remembered the sensations.
	Hades said nothing, staring at the dish as if it had offended him and recalculating his position.
	“No need,” Emet-Selch said before he could stop himself, resolved.
	Hades had entrusted her with their fate...and if he believed in her even after the Great Sundering, then she has to at least try to prove him right in placing his faith in her.
	To every lover who has lost the ones they hold dearest?’ Hades was trying to remain calm, but she looked at him with an understanding he had not wished to betray to her.
	“I am tired of repeating the same argument,” Hades said.
	“Well, an abundance of Light sounds absolutely dreadful to me, at the very least.” Gaia laughed softly at his remark, the sound almost melodious, and Emet-Selch smiled warmly at her.
	She stopped, Hades slowing to a stop as well as she turns to look at her friends, the fires practically licking at their sides now.
	Hades only made one stop on his way out of the room, and that was to press his lips to (Y/N)’s temple before returning to his bedchamber.
	Elidibus hummed quietly, warily eyeing Emet-Selch’s too still form knelt down next to Prometheus’s body.
	I hung back until Emet-Selch finally made his way to me, looking somewhat annoyed.
	But it had been time that made Hythlodaeus capable of the same things Emet-Selch had been capable of; time had shed the man willing to pursue a leisurely life with the people he loved.
	Emet-Selch is loathe to be a noisy lover, easily embarrassed however much his partners enjoy it.
	He had refused to even look at him, and when Hades tried-  tried  - to reach out, gently, carefully, with his soul, to reassure him that it was okay, Hades was still on his side, he wasn’t mad - Prometheus had  snapped  at him.
	“Well I must, if they cause such beautiful magic to be created.” Emet-Selch’s laugh is as clear as a bell, making you turn to face him once more.
	Emet-Selch huffed, and began to extract himself from Azem’s grasp.
	“It very well may be a waste of your time and effort, Emet-Selch.
	Before he could wrangle his sore throat to croak this out, however, Hades pressed the back of his hand against his forehead, then against his cheek, checking his temperature.
	“I was taking a nap…” comes Emet-Selch’s slightly sour reply.
	Automatically, Hades rested a hand atop of his friend’s hair, absently stroking and digging his fingernails into his scalp, staring up at his ceiling beneath his eyelashes.
	Hades crosses his arms over his chest, looking on at them with both pity and anger swimming behind his eyes.
	Hades had never run so fast in his life, rushing out of her field of view so that he could use his Ascian teleportation without her seeing.
	“It was the only path,” Hades said quietly, “A shit decision in a shit situation.
	No matter what, he was saving Hades.
	With a hoarse shout and no other warning, Emet-Selch cums, each tight clench of his body accompanied by what can only be described as a hot  gush  that leaves him shaking and whining.
	It was tinier than Hades’s desk, its surface a mess of crumpled papers, scribbles, pictures, as well as lifelike models of various bird skeletons.
	Azem had found Emet-Selch the next day, their hand catching his own, that endearing smile that begged his forgiveness.
	“As her ally, I feel that it should be obvious I care for her wellbeing as all of you do.” Hades muttered.
	In his mouth, Emet-Selch’s aether is— He is his own hardness, the pressure of Emet-Selch atop his lap, the touch on his face, his agonized scraped-raw fingers tugging vainly on the Ascian’s coat.
	Emet-Selch couldn't hold his tongue anymore.
	Emet-Selch listened and tried desperately to convince himself that they had made the right choice.
	Hades scowled up at the bright sun, making his way down the stairs at a slow, grumbling pace.
	Her heart is beating furiously as Cassia realizes that the words Emet-Selch had read to her while his aether had touched her whole body had not been a random story; they had been his own.
	Something around her shifts, and for a brief moment, Irene feels like she is back in Thanalan, where the warm breeze over her skin gets replaced by chilling cold as she trains and listens to Emet-Selch's lectures.
	So, this meant Hades thought it would benefit Prometheus in someway, for him to push it like this… Hades went a little tense, as he always did whenever Prometheus called him out on his small acts of kindness, and leaned back.
	After their marriage, the days began to slip through Hades’s fingers like seed pearls - tiny, precious things they were, each as idyllic as the last - or as much as they could be with their adversaries breathing down their necks.
	“Ascian or not, Emet does have a heart you know.” She giggled.
	“And you won’t have to,” Emet-Selch heaved himself up from where he sat beside me, rolling out his shoulders this time as he looked down at me.
	Hades watched him, tried to imagine  genuinely  fighting Prometheus.
	He saw the movement of Emet’s hand, reaching toward his own before the realization hit him and he pulled back.
	Emet-Selch gives you a long look, and the smile on his face twists into a grin as his free hand runs over your naked body, claws scratching over your shivering skin.
	In a move you probably should have expected, Hades bucks his hips up, erection peeking back through the waters – a bit less red and pained looking, but still flushed from the tub’s heat.
	Hades compared them all and found them wanting for his own reasons.
	"Hades--" This time when Emet-Selch cut him off, it was with his lips crashing into his.
	His face was in slight shadow, but Hades recognised it all the same.
	Thinking of the words Elidibus would have for him were he here, Emet-Selch remains among the trees long after she departs.
	Show us both just how easy you are, my dear," Emet-Selch murmurs lowly before he lets his teeth scrape over the sensitive skin at your nape.
	Emet-Selch doesn’t give him a chance.
	Hades scowled, looking over the clothes.
	Though our world is gone, Hades has always believed in you most of all, our shepherd to the stars in the dark.
	Emet-Selch remembers old friends.
	“Elidibus, you’ve come to gander at the wonders of this world,” Emet greets ‘Elidibus’ with cold in his voice.
	But… well, while it was an interesting mystery to dwell over, Hades very quickly lost interest.
	Emet-Selch moves to stand beside you, holding out a hand in invitation, and with a last deep breath you reach out and take it.
	“Mhm,” Hades didn’t even bother trying to pretend he wasn’t shameless, idly stroking his dirty thighs, his thumbs pressing against the sensitive insides.
	Hades was cut off.
	Impulsiveness overtook Emet-Selch in a wild rash.
	This went on for a moment, the water running quelled their independent thoughts and Emet felt both tranquil and at ease ruminating while moving from one limb to the next.
	It was a wonder when she wasn’t up to something against her code without finding you had helped her achieve it.”  Hades’ hand rubbed his temple as he thought of it.
	When I outed him as an Ascian, Hades changed his physique back to the original and reached for my hand as I explained, demonstrated even, what I  really  was to them.
	Luckily, Hades realised this  wasn’t  one of those arguments where he could charm his way back into Prometheus’s good books.
	Your nails cut and claw into Hades as he wraps his arms around, pressing you into his skin and whispering into your lips.
	Emet-Selch wondered how much of his own taste he could get away with introducing.
	The forearm was lifted only for that strong hand to take Emet-Selch by the shoulders and press him against face of the large rock.
	Hades who had been silently watching the interaction broke his stare from the two memories.
	That's all I got and I'm just :'))) Because if this is indeed Mitron, I want to know how they survived after Ardbert and friends supposedly killed them (or maybe another fragment of their soul was raised up as Hades said he and Elidibus could do prior to them getting absolutely dunked on by the WoL pffttt) and I want to see what Mitron being alive does to the story now that we have no Unsundered left + Fandaniel being, well, Fandaniel lmao (sidenote: this fic is going to probably end where patch 5.3 ends for the msq (right after we bop Elidibus) so if patch 5.4 ends up doing some big reveals we might see a sequel with Aestelle and everyone else going up against Fandaniel :3 I'm not saying Elidibus and Hades will 100% survive this mess here, but if they do would you guys want to see a sequel with Aestelle and them going through patch 5.4 and probably the next dlc once that drops?
	Through you, Emet-Selch has shaped the Source into a world capable of protecting itself and has personally overseen your rebirth countless times over in order to make certain that you grew into the steward these stars need.” You have triumphed over him and thus proven to Emet-Selch that you and the rest of these mortals are now worthy of looking after themselves with you acting as their first and most reliant line of defense.” Hades truly went above and beyond in recreating them… She’ll have to ask why it is he created them this time around once he wakes up.
	In the early hours of the morning, where the sun was barely touching the horizon and Amaurot was hushed and soft, Hades woke up.
	You won’t be finishing them yet—and not in that manner.” Hythlodaeus gently pulled at Hades’s hair, guiding him off Azem’s shaft.
	Emet-Selch draws upon that same power once more and casts it with every onze of command he has at his disposal as a single word.
	“Oh, you misunderstand me,” Emet-Selch says with a small shake of his head.
	Hades opened his eyes to the room, blurry though they’d be at their inspection.
	The Emissary said nothing at that, but much to Emet-Selch’s ire, Fandaniel had enough words for the two of them combined.
	Emet-Selch had imagined himself above such pleasures; he discovers, when your lips descend onto him, that he is quite mistaken.
	Emet follows suit, his lips twisted into a frown.
	“Ah, but with you two, it’s a little different,” Hythlodaeus said, “Your relationship with Hades is a lot more… ah, how should I put it?
	A few days later, I was sitting on a bench, taking a break and getting a drink of water after an intense round of magical drills with Hades.
	Our ally identified you thus to be Hades, If I recall.” “Yes, Hades is my true name, if you must know,” he admitted to them all.
	Not many approached  the 14th  for a myriad of reasons, mostly due to his own faulty personality and esoteric knowledge, and while he told himself that was preferred (he’d lose his mind if he got mobbed as often as Hades did), he couldn’t help but feel mildly put out at times.
	“Was this your home…?” Aza asked the empty house, half-expecting Emet-Selch to slither out of the shadows and sneer at him.
	Wrinkles mar the perfect shape of Emet-Selch’s brow as it twists, the amber pools of his eyes aglow with worry.
	And of all the Ascians to be given such freedom, of course Fandaniel would be among them─the most controversial and problematic member on the Convocation by far (more so than herself even) and judging by what Hades told her of him, he hasn’t changed a bit for the better and has somehow gotten worse in his manipulative ways and psychotic behavior since the Great Sundering.
	Hades could picture it, the glimpse of her soul in his recreated, burning Amaurot, the shade that watched him, spoke to him, calling out for his penance, his understanding.
	Hades took off into the air, putting distance between him and us before casting an onslaught of spells in quick succession, forcing us to dodge.
	Emet-Selch thanked them and departed, hoping that he would still be there-- and there he was indeed.
	With his eyes upturned to the open air, Hades looked first to the left, then to the right.
	“I certainly won’t protest,” Emet-Selch shrugs, “Though I had half a mind to have her sit in on the lecture.
	Hades woke to the sound of movement, and opened one eye.
	“  You  have to stop blaming yourself, Hades,” she insisted.
	Now all that’s left is to pray…” Aestelle said softly, reaching to take Hades' hand into her own while the morpho slowly descends to land on his chest.
	The miqo’te tensed as a sudden shiver ran through his arm, but Hades pushed faster than he could recoil, snagging the networks of his aether like a vice.
	It took a moment for Hades to find his words, “How…” His voice was dry, “How do you know that name?” The hero watched as Emet-Selch’s face paled, a hand reaching up to his collar.
	“It seems we’ll just have to make do with each other, then.” Helios’s voice, in contrast, is hoarse and fucked out and going straight to Hades’s cock.
	With a dull creak, the doors to the building opened at last, and Hades's full attention snapped to the man strolling towards him.
	Once more, he is defeated; if there is one who can deny your small and heartfelt request, Emet-Selch is not he.
	Ever since Hades gave Hythlodaeus the Convocations soul crystals to pass onto her and in turn giving her Echo the push it needed to begin unlocking her memories, Amaurot has come to hold such a deeper meaning─a deeper connection even.
	Though that she is still in pain I have no doubt.” Emet-Selch offered roughly in response, leaning forward in the chair beside her bed, his elbows resting on his knees as he closely studied both her physical condition and her aetheric one.
	Hades smiled, warmed through.
	You saved us both, Hades, and now I can save you.
	But Mitron and Loghrif had failed in their duties, and so it was left to Emet-Selch to clean up the messes of his inferiors yet again.
	“You,” Emet-Selch snarls.
	Prometheus let out a dissatisfied ‘hrmph’ noise, “You’re so boring, Hades…” “No, I just don’t worry about unimportant things,” Hades yawned, “Now shush, I’m trying to nap.” Prometheus went quiet, and Hades managed to drift off a little.
	Emet turned and looked back at the Exarch, returning to the bed in quick strides.
	Hades shifted his weight, a brief sign of his discomfort, but he didn’t apologise, “It’s something you need to get over.”  Metis mulled over that as Prometheus and Hades slipped into one of their regular squabbles, Hythlodaeus anxiously refereeing.
	“How good of you to rejoin the realm of the living, Hades.” “I don’t think Hades would reabsorb  me.” “You’re in no position to be picky, Hades,” she said with exasperation.
	Hades had yet to truly discuss with him his plans for said Tower, but he was hopeful in hearing that he’d begun to take steps in learning what the Allagan technologies could do for their plight.
	"Better luck next time, I guess," Emet-Selch murmurs, his hot breath ghosting over your skin, but the self-satisfied look in his eyes only spurs you on, and with a growl, your hands dig into his arm, trying to dislodge him.
	Staring down at you, Emet-Selch raises a brow to match his lips lifting at the corner, “Oh, come now, hero.
	The figure, Hades, scoffed.
	Hades' eyes flutter shut for a moment as he leans into her touch and takes in a deep breath.
	As Hades reached the top of a small hill, offering him a wide view of what remained of the island, all he saw was ash, volcanic rock, and a half-crumbled mountain.
	Prometheus found it exhausting and irritating just during his working hours, so he honestly had no idea how Hades dealt with it 24/7.
	“Have you stooped so low now that you’ll attack when someone’s back is turned?” Hades asked with a shake of his head, ignoring the previous comment.
	Hades considered her for a moment, thinking on the petite roma he’d just swallowed; juicy, perhaps a little unripe, though it wasn’t unpleasant.
	I feared the worst when Hades fished you out of that Lifestream spring!” “One of your workshop rooms is now a permanent Lifestream spring,” Hades answered, “You were floating facedown in it by the time we managed to break in there.” Hades was speaking in that low, detached way of his that said he was upset, but was trying not to show he was upset.
	"The host is adequate," interjected Emet-Selch, "though hardly the most entertaining thing worth beholding at the moment."
	Even so, the traveler whispered, “She’ll come,” and Hades had not the heart to argue.
	“Of course,” Hades said.
	“Seven hells, Hades…” There is no thought of stopping Hades as he unhurriedly unties and works the garment off of your body.
	Hades exhaled an exasperated sigh.
	“But—“ Hades began.
	“How long has it been?” Emet-Selch asked, his voice lined with velvet.
	Hades really did win that one.
	(One day Emet-Selch might be honest with himself, but today is not that day.)
	Gently, Hades took Azem’s cock in one hand and began to thrust the sound into them with the other, their impassioned gasps and moans fueling him further.
	The view higher up was clear enough that Aeliana could witness, just in time, how Emet-Selch took to the skies on his steed to lead the charybdis by example.
	It’s Emet-Selch.
	“I wonder how Emet-Selch messed it up so badly.” “Perhaps he’s just upset that, of the two of us, I maintained my youthful good looks and charm, whereas time has done Emet-Selch no favors.”  “Oh come now, Hades.
	Keeping his lips on hers, and his finger through the makeshift lead, Hades pulled her back into the room with him, then turned, hooking one foot behind hers.
	So the Hades feels clearly hit hard when I wrote this lmao but what can I say, I'm a sucker for the feels xD Also the idea of Aestelle giving Hades a cute lil necklace is actually too adorable to pass up.
	"Hades, I've missed you too…" she admits, wavering.
	“Does she feel good around you?” Emet-Selch asks, voice dropping low and husky.
	Xelinah can hear the eye roll in Emet-Selch’s reply.
	Emet-Selch had stolen most of the attention: what with the whole ‘founder of the Garlean empire’ credited to his name.
	Hades sensed his aether fading from within the hero’s core, the fragments of her soul clicking and rejoining as his essence was thrust in finality from the wound.
	Emet-Selch bent low, close enough that G'raha could feel his breath, and whispered, "I don't believe you."
	Of course, Emet-Selch knows exactly why you're doing this and what you are truly asking for.
	Hades will have to intervene then.
	“I’m asking for help, Emet.
	“Urk,” Hades coughed when Prometheus’s  considerable weight knocked the wind out of him, getting a very uncomfortable knee close to his groin and an elbow to the ribs before they sorted themselves out.
	In the end, she relents, hoping time with Emet would make those thoughts come further into fruition or abate the doubts away.
	“Let me guess,” Emet-Selch responded with a gravelly voice and the contempt to fill at least one lifetime.
	Remember, Emet-Selch loves you and wants you to be happy!
	Unlike how she scooped their son up, frantic and desperate to have him in her arms, she is slow with Hades, and he with her.
	No matter how strong she gets, she’ll always be weaker than Hades and Elidibus… How is she to ever fulfill her duty to the Convocation if this is her reality?
	“I  was trying to keep things slow for you, like the considerate friend that I am,” Hades drawled, but he looked pleased, very pleased, and pressed against Prometheus’s ass, restarting the rhythm between their hips.
	Ryne was waiting for them in the foyer, eager to seek out the new coffeecakes that’d been introduced in the local café—she’d agreed to go with her to get one, but she doubted Emet-Selch would want to indulge the Oracle.
	Eventually I met Emet and later Elidibus and suddenly I was friends with all of you as well and I...I can’t just stop trying.” “What about Emet-Selch?
	Cracks of renewed desire resonated in each syllable that she spoke, and Emet-Selch let his eyes drift shut when she sucked his index-finger into her mouth.
	Right now, however, Hades honestly had no idea what his friend was going to do, and he was uncomfortably aware that if Prometheus attacked him, he would draw a considerable amount of blood before Hades could subdue him.
	“It honestly sounds like you’re not ready to face the reality of what transpired between the two of you, Emet-Selch.
	“Are you alright, Emet?” As he averted his eyes, Hades took note that the two who had been seated with them previously were now absent.
	“We’re on the far continent,” they said, confirming what Hades and Hythlodaeus had already suspected.
	In response, Emet-Selch smiled down at her, not bothering to hide his amusement in the slightest.
	Chapter Six:   Dancing (Emet-Selch/Azem, Thancred&WoL, Haurchefant/WoL, Estinien&WoL, Alphinaud&WoL, Alisaie&WoL, Magnai&WoL, G’Raha/WoL, multi.)
	“This was decidedly  not  how we wanted things to end, Emet-Selch!” They lifted their arms and, together, began streaming a similar light towards Emet-Selch.
	There is a pained look in Emet-Selch’s eyes as he admits, “It has driven some of them insane.” “I’ve been watching your exploits here in the First with my full attention,” Emet-Selch points out.
	“…debauched…” Hades offered.
	Hades’ expression turned sour.
	Emet-Selch seems to guess what you’re thinking, because he laughs quietly.
	Emet-Selch turned back to me, his gaze scrutinizing every ilm of my body, pausing for a long moment on my chest- my soul- before sliding to the earring still lying on his nightstand.
	“Persephone was always quite beautiful.” Elidibus said, and Hades bore his teeth at his use of her most secret name, her true name in ancient Amaurot.
	Warrior of Light as well.” Hades scoffed, but did as she ordered.
	Hades brows shot upwards.
	For that, Emet-Selch would  never  forgive  him.
	Beneath you, Hades’s mouth stops working over your sex.
	“Hades—would you like to fuck them?” Hythlodaeus asked, causing a moan to escape Hades at the mere thought.
	Now Hades’ presence just served as a memory, a scar, reminding all of what he had tried to ruin and destroy in Zodiark’s name.
	She’s home in Amaurot and Hades is here too.
	The name Hades still sat on his tongue, the name Hythlodaeus ringing in his mind.
	It was Hades’s ‘great achievement’ that had him considered for the Emet-Selch title all those centuries ago, as it cut down on the housing crisis by allowing for more homes built on a smaller area.
	Why yes, I was enabled by the wonderful people over at  Emet-Selch's Wholesomely Debauched Book Club and you're free to join us in Discord whether you write your own or simply read FFXIV fanfic!
	As if anticipating this, Emet had pushed her hands away and began to undo the ties for her.
	"I want… Hades,  I want  --" Persephone's babbling is silenced as Hades snares her into a bruising kiss.  "
	Beneath the cologne he wears as part of his mortal guise, Emet-Selch smells like leather and dust.
	You’re still just as fiercely possessive of her.” Hades said nothing, so Elidibus continued, “I will take your letter.
	“That remains to be seen,” Hades mumbled from the corner, causing a breath of a laugh to come from the Elder Seedseer.
	Emet-Selch shifts slightly, coming to hover over you, but his hand never leaves you.
	Hades lifted a brow and rattled the bag, the jingle of coin resounding from within.
	Emet-Selch only shrugs as he leans against one of the bookshelves.
	“But you weren’t able to,” Hades deduced.
	Hades leaned his head forward, bringing it to hers as he closed his eyes, both of his hands upon her face now as he continued to soothe her.
	Her personal collection had to go somewhere.” He looked about the room, then let his gaze settle on Hades in disapproval.
	She was more than prepared to die for the Convocation before the Great Sundering and she is still ready to trade her life for Hades and her friends if a time comes and her death is the only answer to their plight.
	"Go on, my dear,"  Emet-Selch murmurs.
	Hades makes a face.
	Held her gaze while Emet-Selch ripped the panties he’d woven from her body in such a rough fashion that the fabric bit into her skin before it snapped free.
	“Amaurot is our home,” Hades continued after a heavy silence, “I don’t… understand why you would want to run away from it.” “What,” Hades started, slightly alarmed, but his friend spoke over him.
	Even without the world asunder into fourteen different pieces and twelve thousand years of pain, grief, and loss heaped upon his shoulders to blame, Emet-Selch is  still  an asshole.
	"It was a rare occurrence," Emet-Selch adds, "but he always had the  annoying  habit of looking out for us over his own health, and  then it was our turn to watch over his wellbeing.
	“It was well in hand, Emet-Selch.
	The shard Ryne’s voice echoed from was from the confrontation with Emet-Selch, right before I had begun my fight with him in earnest.
	All he could hear was the wet noise of it repeatedly fucking him over and over, his own muffled grunts and moans and whines as his mouth was fucked over and over again, and Hades’s own quieter, yet fast-paced breathing as his soul blazed beneath him like an inferno.
	As you shudder Elidibus cradles you securely against his chest with one arm around your waist, his other hand playing with your breasts; cupping, stroking, and squeezing, slowly driving you mad with desire, while Emet-Selch’s fingers teasingly circle your labia, ghosting across your aching slit.
	Hades?”  “Get your fat butt off me, Hades…!”  “Hades!
	When Hythlodaeus and Emet-Selch hold in their hands the portrait made in the image of the Warrior of Light, the Hero of Eorzea, their breaths catch in their throats.
	“Wait.” Hythlodaeus reached for Emet-Selch’s shoulder when the latter moved to intervene.
	It was still there, of course, just as it was before her battle with Hades.
	He’s...Hades is alright.
	“Do you know the most reliable way to deal with those who stubbornly refuse to see reason?” Hades continued, the young girl pressing her hand harder on top of her amethyst and pressing the gem into her chest while keeping her eyes firmly shut.
	As Emet-Selch has said,” she finds after the first couple words her voice grows loud enough to be heard all the way in the back.
	It wasn’t a cold shoulder - Hades knew when Prometheus was angry at him.
	“When did we get married?” Hades asked only to laugh the moment she smacked his arm.
	Hades spends long moments pressing honeyed whispers of praise and worship into your flesh, how perfect you are—your soul so exquisite and heaven incarnate—in his hands  at last.
	Hades moved back over her and pushed his way back inside, delighted to find her deliciously wet.
	Ah, now that Emet is zonked out asleep, we get downtime for me to panic set up plot for later chapters (don't mind me having a mental breakdown over trying to figure out how to juggle the Eden raids + Werlyt Chronicles + role quests and the Thirteenth :3) These are the moments I wish I would have preplanned like, a month in advance because I'm just thinking of all the things I want to include in this fic and questioning how the actual hell I'm supposed to somehow write it all in without either dragging on the story to the point it's a bore to read through or risking the possibility of making a confusing and convoluted plot that could all become a bunch of jumbled nonsense lmao send help my brain is imploding.
	Hades would sooner die than be intimate with Lahabrea, in any way, but the speaker did have a way with words and subtle insults, and with your mouth on him his arousal is inevitable and undeniable.
	No man could motherhen like Hades when the mood struck him.
	Igeyorhm and the power of the void, Emmerololth and the elemental aspect of Dark, Nabriales’s research into the fabric of reality and pocket universes, Emet-Selch’s concept of souls and willpower, Lahabrea’s theories on – on nearly everything, what form He should take, how His aether would be structured and behave, Elidibus would need to balance the creation to keep it from spiraling – In the best of times, two intimately linked individuals – ones such as you and Hades, or you and Hythlodaeus, or perhaps under great duress, the three of you together – who had shared aether, could pool their souls to produce a Creation influenced by both minds.
	Her smile wavered some while a tear managed to slip down her cheek, Hades no more than a few fulms away from her now.
	But Hades just applied more pressure on the small of his back, keeping their hips snug.
	“I have gotten very good at fixing Prometheus’s messes, in the last few millennia,” Emet-Selch said, “I will find a solution to this one too.” Emet-Selch paused for a long moment, then replied, distantly, “Yes.
	He…” Hades furrowed his brow.
	“Could you attempt to open up a portal to where you intend to let Hades rest?” She wasn’t given a chance to respond before Hythlodaeus was turning his attention to her and enveloping both herself and Hades in her own aether, pulling the portal to carry them across the rift.
	Hades found (Y/N) a few minutes later, a linkpearl pressed into her ear in the library.
	It took Hades entirely by surprise, knocking him out of the relaxing, rhythmic flow of pleasure he’d sunk into - just in time to feel Prometheus release all over his stomach.
	“I hurt people that tried to help me,” Irene murmurs as she remembers what Emet-Selch had told her in the cell.
	“For millennia, I struggled to rejoin Zodiark - to bring Him back to His full power so that He might stand against Hydaelyn as equals.” He looked up, behind Hades, to Hydaelyn, where Her image floated amidst the destruction.
	Hades's touch trembles against his skin.
	Emet-Selch’s hands are cool on her skin as he cradles her closer, and then his lips are on hers.
	You scratch your nails down Elidibus’s chest and he moans again, shuddering, and then Emet-Selch carefully slips a hand between his lover’s thighs and with his hips propped and tilted upwards you can see the two fingers slide in, and Elidibus cries out as his pleasure detonates, a hoarse, incoherent sound of absolute ecstasy that you feel as much as hear, your body pressed so close to his that his shudders are also yours.
	The street lamps flickered to life as Hades paced restlessly outside the office of the Bureau of the Architect.
	What if he can’t be saved, Hades..?
	Every painful experience, every joy you felt, every little surprise you planned… One look from our dear Hades and we'd know everything."
	Let me do this.”  As he speaks Elidibus takes your other hand, letting his ornamented glove with its deadly claws melt into shadows and vanish, and the two Ascians glare at each other in a brief battle of wills before finally Emet-Selch concedes the point and lets go.
	"Heh heh, wait—Hades, wait!"
	We can simply sleep together, right, Hades?” Not realizing her phrasing was already peculiar to begin with, the fact that Azem had deemed to use Hades’ name instead of his title for that sentence only furthered to misconstrue the intimate meaning.
	“I had not expected to see you so soon,” Emet-Selch.
	“I’ll call you Emet-Selch,” You said dryly, prompting a snort of laughter.
	Hades held him tightly.
	“Only three were fortunate enough to escape the sundering─me being one of them.” Hades said solemnly.
	With all of their thoughts weighing heavily on their conscience, their small party of five started off in the direction Hades had left in.
	But that in and of itself poses a problem if she is indeed needed to go and beseech the aid of the one who can yet save Emet-Selch.” “Just as Emet-Selch has said time and time again, it is not your job to be the strong one all of the time.” Lahabrea reminded.
	“Emet-Selch -” The hour is late when Emet-Selch makes his way to the Pendants, his heart heavy and his eyes downcast.
	Hythlodaeus gripped his panting partner’s chin, tilting their head back so he could whisper against the corner of their mouth, “Because Hades is not the only one you tormented.
	On Hades’ other side, Hythlodaeus tensed.
	He did not know where he was precisely nor where he was going or how he might find the Warrior and escape the purgatory Emet-Selch had sent him to, but he kept moving because anything was better than that room and that man.
	“We’ll talk later,” Hades said, “When you’ve cooled off.” Hades huffed at him, but he left the lab without further comment.
	Curious despite himself, Emet-Selch cracked an eye open as the idiot set something down on the ground, between the roots of the tree.
	It suited them, Emet-Selch had always thought.
	Anything to save Hades is all she can think of.
	Truly.” Alphinaud spoke up from behind her, Hades cold glare being shot over her head and to the young elezen.
	“Hmm…” Hades pressed his hand over Prometheus’s, holding it over his heart, “Fine, you’ve gotten me interested.
	Lest their feeble brains break,” Emet muttered.
	Emet-Selch returns to the First under the guise of helping Mitron, but he takes himself far, far from the lands of people.
	Not now Hades.
	Sickeningly adorable a couple as Mitron and Loghrif were, Emet-Selch still regretted being right about his appraisal of them as too clever by half, and all the more their responsibility falling to him after their deaths.
	A hero…?” She sounded rather surprised to hear about that side of Emet-Selch.
	Hades moaned as he took Hythlodaeus’s soft cock into his mouth, lavishing his partner with fervor.
	He had a feeling Emet had been hoping to catch a glimpse of the Warrior through the glass.
	Emet-Selch licks it away, tongue pressing to the roof of the Exarch’s mouth, and then he pulls back, as abruptly as he had kissed him in the first place.
	The tears were making it harder and harder to see him, “P-Please stop this, we will find a way,” She managed to turn her jaw from the ground, pushing herself to her elbows, “I-I will help you, Hades.
	Save for the kisses in the concert hall and in the car, Emet had been thoroughly conservative with his affections.
	Emet-Selch could only shake his head, though more out of annoyance than outright denial of his question.
	No matter what they later chose to specialize in, whether it was concept creation like Hythlodaeus or esoteric magicks like Hades, all students received the same basic education.
	“Do you think we can let it go, Hades?” It’s back at Emet-Selch’s apartment.
	Being with Emet-Selch she doesn’t need a writ of passage to enter the capitol building, earning barely even a spare glance from those around them.
	He is torn between hate and anger and burning, incorrigible jealousy as he watches the Warrior of Light kiss Emet-Selch.
	Finally, the topic shifting to Hades is something she can actually defend herself against.
	Hades peeked out from under his forearm, attention drawn.
	“While Emet-selch might be unwilling to lend his aid, I intend to keep my word.
	If it hadn’t been for Hades’s quick thinking, if he hadn’t staunched the aether bleed the instant Prometheus had landed in his bed, he would’ve… Prometheus didn’t seem to be resting well either, slowly fighting through Hades’s sleep spell and rousing into aching consciousness.
	“Venat informed us that you were ill, and I offered to return to you in her stead,” Emet-Selch informed, settling Azem back under their covers.
	Thancred leaped over her, crashing his gunblade down into the barrier Hades has created around himself.
	But he is so rarely Hades, anymore, between meetings and theorizing, and the reality that as the one most attuned to the Underworld, it will be his duty to channel the souls… being offered, into the summoning spell.
	Emet-Selch couldn’t deny the boy any measure of comfort that he could offer.
	As I set my bag down on the bed, I only barely had time to register the fact that Emet-Selch stiffened in my peripheral before my eyes fell on an oil painting hanging within the room.
	“I have a use for you,” (Y/N) answered enigmatically, and though it did not give him the direction Hades was hoping for, it at least spared him the end of that disastrous train of thought.
	It took Hades a while to realise Prometheus had fallen back to sleep - right there, after saying ‘I love you’, he just dozed right off.
	Azem held back a shudder as they watched Hythlodaeus tease Hades’s shaft with lips and tongue.
	But it stops there- and Hythlodaeus, to Hades’s chagrin, again seems more than willing to follow Helios’s lead.
	Hades let out a long and heavy sigh but didn’t respond as they made their way past the large doors of the Tower and began the lengthy ascent up the spire.
	Hades would have some choice words for you, that, at least, you were sure of.
	And here I am crying over Hades day in and day out when you’ve lost someone close to you as well… I’m sorry.
	Their mouth formed the shape of words—Hades, Hythlodaeus—but no sound escaped them.
	Hythlodaeus’ fingers and Aeliana’s lips working in tandem, the two of them having found their connection as one with minds that rode the same current in their desire to see Emet-Selch pushed to renewed heights.
	“Elidibus, be a dear and  fuck  off,” Emet states, “I said it once nicely.” Emet groans, getting enough space from him to throw the empty glass at him.
	Catch them unawares, speaking in hushed whispers about their nefarious plans?” Emet-Selch regarded the gunbreaker with exasperation.
	Gasping, Hythlodaeus buried himself fully in Azem and released within them driving them to a second climax, body shaking as they squirted around his length, a dry orgasm simultaneously rocking their dick as it remained within Hades.
	I opened my eyes, sleep still blurring my vision, but I could see Hades still fast asleep next to me.
	Looking back on those memories of being able to create, of being able to bring things into being by just thinking about it, you had been tempted on multiple accounts to ask Emet-Selch to help you reach into those powers.
	“Hades!” So you do not listen, ever so determined to meet Hades somewhere in the middle, even as his gnarled soul pours into you and splits you from the inside out.
	Flipping the tome open, he paused and looked up at the door where Emet had left.
	Hades squeezed her hand lightly.
	A small crack - Hades blinks, and the pen he held now lies in two pathetic pieces on the desk, stark black ink glistening all over his hand.
	Emet-Selch wants to be smug, wants to say something that will make her reach across the man between them and tug at his hair, bite his lips, but the words falter on his tongue when he sees just how blissful she is in the moment.
	It is unbearably tight; Emet-Selch clenches around him, the muscles of his nether entrance clenching around him.
	At that, Emet-Selch lets out a laugh.
	Hades and she and been hauled up with Igeyorhm and others at the Bureau of the Conservator, or the Akademia if he remembered, trying to find a means to delay their inevitable, buy Lahabrea and Elidibus more time.
	Emet was concerned for the health of the Exarch, but he would not reveal such to these sundered beings.
	In retrospect, Hades shouldn’t have been surprised that Prometheus decided to run away.
	She squinted her eyes, clearly having more trouble in seeing whatever it was she was looking for than either Hythlodaeus or Emet-Selch had.
	He did not see Emet-Selch until the following year.
	Your gait is purposeful and your grip around his hand is firm, dragging Hades along just as sure as you drag the deep laughter from his lungs.
	“Does it not sound familiar?” Emet-Selch prompted, his tone wheedling.
	That was partially his fault: he had teased Hades to the point of the other man using that braid in his ‘punishments’.
	Hades must’ve failed to restore him perfectly, must have caused damage when clumsily forcing the two halves back together, and now a madness had taken root, a brokenness to Prometheus’s soul that couldn’t be healed unless his soul was shattered again to be remade back to what it once was.
	Hades suspected he merely did not want to want to return to school, even though they had by now missed the last of their exams.
	Hades clenched his fists, blood had begun to flow from his now rapidly swelling hand, “I never said I would assist you or your champion.” Hades clenched his teeth and began to rise from the floor.
	“Over dinner, perhaps,” Hades said, looking around at the rest of the group.
	“How do you know this for certain if you’ve never fought these replicas before?” Gaius asked, Hades glancing down at her curiously as well.
	I wish you could see it...” Hades breathes, his voice then swaying into a sweet song of yore.
	“Hythlodaeus,” Hades muttered, leaning away, but still keeping his hands on his cheeks, “Call Hythlodaeus, now!” “Calling Hythlodaeus,”  a soft, artificial voice hummed, followed by a sleep-rough, familiar voice of,  “Emet-Selch?
	I took Hades’ hand for a moment and squeezed it before jumping back into the air.
	“Excuse me?” Adriene hisses just as Cassia lets out an offended “Hey!” on her sister’s behalf, but neither one of their sharp tones seem to have any impact on Emet-Selch.
	“And you think I can go on if I must watch you die yet again?” Hades countered, following closely after her while the three they left behind watch them with curious expressions.
	“Beq Lugg can help us with figuring out the finer details to soul preservation and transference─after he’s helped me save Emet, that is.” But Emet’s condition worsens the further I’m away from him so I have to stay behind this time and leave this task to you all.
	Hades pressed a little harder into her, shifting ever so slightly so he could instead sit down properly with his shoulder tucked under her chest and his head resting over where he can perfectly hear her heartbeat.
	When I had gone to sit next to him, Hades had grabbed me by the wrist and pulled me down into his lap, then wrapped his arms loosely around me.
	Emet-Selch seems determined to give them one.
	Anger, hot and heavy and red, welled up within Hades, and he rushed the boy, claws of his Ascian form extended toward him.
	Prometheus burst into laughter, giggling as Hades huffed and scowled at him for ‘ruining the mood’.
	It had been Hades’ parting wish.
	Emet-Selch grabbed their hand.
	Calming her so effortlessly as she left her robe in the drawer and went to open the door, only by an ilm to make sure no one else would catch her looking so uncouth, as Emet-Selch would say.
	The braid was yours and Hades' idea a bit after I got my position as Chief of the Bureau of the Architect…" Emet-Selch cuts in.
	When she pulled away, Hades stepped up to us and she turned to him.
	Hades’s voice is more of a plea than aught else, and you have those godsdamned tears pricking behind your lids again to the look he is giving you.
	Not by much, but enough that by the time they reach the building they turn to wait for her, Emet-Selch sighing.
	And Emet-Selch knows it.
	It’s so  him that Hades can’t help but return a small one in his direction.
	Unlike what Elidibus says when he comes to Emet-Selch, when he comes to the last of the Unsundered besides himself, silently, wordlessly, reaching out with his aether.
	Her chest tightened as she glanced around, looking for Hades despite knowing she won’t find him.
	“You know, this hot-cold approach you’re doing is giving me very mixed signals,” the idiot said, like  Emet-Selch  was being the unreasonable one here, “You’re all helpful and friendly one minute, then you act like this.” Go away,  Emet-Selch thought aggressively, his fingers curling into the sleeves of his coat.
	Uncertain which of them he intended to use the instruments on, but eager to find out, Hades did as he was told, then pressed himself into Azem’s back again, his hands moving to slowly lavish their length with attention.
	Bear witness to the unspoken exchange which passed between the two men before Emet-Selch pressed into her back and let his pelvis graze the top of her tail.
	His hand removes itself to reveal slick-glistened fingers to her sight and Emet-Selch's own.
	I looked around the table to catch my friends’ reactions as Hades, yet again, apologized to them.
	Hades laughed, near hysterical.
	Which was Hades’ way of saying ‘I’m glad to see you but I actually need to do work right now and no I do not mean I can do it later’.
	The Source is her home along with Hades.
	Hades questioned, his voice held no scorn, only respect and curiosity to their discussion.
	She is standing at the sides, looking from a distance at the proceedings at the ladder, when she feels Emet-Selch coming up behind her.
	Hades had been the one to design it.
	After his utterance of my name, Emet-Selch was no longer by my side lying in the bed, but was now perched on the edge, watching me.
	“I drifted off,” Hades said, waving his hand dismissively, “Utilising rift energy to cause spell transmutation isn’t exactly a new science.” With that, the young man gave Prometheus a shallow bow of farewell, Hades an uncertain look as he skittered around him, and swiftly left the lab.
	When a break was announced so they could prepare to interview the Convocation and prove their temperings were broken, Gaia approached Hades and I.
	Lahabrea, a man with blonde tousled waves stared eagerly at the door until his eyes glanced in Emet’s direction.
	"You are the same, memories of your own or not," Emet-Selch vows, and his fingers trail over your face before his lips close over yours.
	Ever the voice of reason among the three of them, even if Emet-Selch would argue otherwise, Hythlodaeus prefers to work from behind the scenes than in the spotlight.
	Your eyes roll back, and you shudder, moaning shamelessly as Emet-Selch twists his hand ever so slightly.
	Hades shrugged as they neared the doors to the Ocular, the long crystalline staircase up to the top of the Tower stretching out behind them.
	At this point, they reached the front door where Hades was waiting.
	“Good, then.” Hades isn’t scornful, exactly, because the pride is still there, and you know the shame of his behavior towards you in the past colors each world.
	I will take what is mine, (Y/N).” Hades stepped back and straightened himself, then offered his arm.
	“You are implying that the author put in all these little references you seem to cling to, but they are all circumstantial,” Emet-Selch argues back brashly.
	If Emet-Selch hopes to get him out of this room, he will need to endure this little interrogation.
	Hades floundering in the darkness, desperately scrambling for every  drop  of power he had - what power his God squeezed out of him, that poisonous voice that became comforting over the cold, lonely eternity since his world ended thundering in his skull to  ‘kill the enemy, kill Her servant,   kill your heart   ’  until his soul resonated with the desire  (command).
	When our meeting had ended, most of us in a better mood, I reached out to Hades through the tether.
	"How many times have we told you, Emet-Selch?
	Perhaps another man may have taken his time, but Emet-Selch is not a patient man, not now, and you don’t need the preamble.
	I dismissed the girl attending me to get some lunch as the Elder Seedseer eyed Hades, sitting at a desk in the corner of the room, and then sat down on a cushioned chair next to me.
	“Easier said than done thanks to your unruly successor,” Emet-Selch shot back after a split-second of near indignation, a smile tugging on his lips rather than that infamous scowl.
	In it lie the other two books Emet-Selch had given her.
	"It's a warm colour, one that shines very brilliantly too," and with a smirk that usually spells trouble, he adds: "I always thought it matched Hades' eyes quite well."
	“Well, run along to your master now,” Emet-Selch told me once I looked at him.
	Prometheus will just whine about it later,” Hades said, curling a lock of dark hair around his finger and gently pulling, “Won’t you?” “Even though it’s  your  mess,” Hades tutted, but he didn’t sound annoyed, “Do you know what happened?” Hades felt dissatisfied with this explanation, but his knowledge on Lifestreams was basic at best, so took it at face value.
	Whenever Hades performed such acts, he always appeared so…subservient.
	Heat spread through the entirety of my body as he released his burning desire for me into the bond and Hades gripped my hips, guiding me up and back down again so that he entered me slowly, savoring every second of the sensation as my soul, so close to completion, mingled with his.
	I could feel that my eyes were still swollen from crying the night before, but with a snap, Hades had us dressed and he dragged me out the door.
	I absently lifted my hand to my lips to rid myself of the sticky residue, but Hades caught my wrist.
	Obstinate as ever, Emet-Selch grumbled, “And who says my mind was changed in that regard?” Deadpan and accurate in his response, Hythlodaeus elicited an all too exasperated sigh from Emet-Selch—the sort that had been bells in the making.
	Hythlodaeus doesn’t wait to start thrusting, and it ignites something in Hades to see the gentlest of his lovers driven by passion.
	Now, hearing Emet speak as though everything they have ever done was the will of a primal, it bore too much upon him.
	With large clawed hands outstretched, Hades slowly closed the gap between them as she went on the defensive.
	Hades soul was like a smouldering ember at his back - sleepy and low-burning, content to sit and wait until Prometheus was done.
	“Oh?” Hades said.
	“We’re both dead now,” Hades could hear the smile in Prometheus’s voice, “You’re about several eons late, though.
	"How very generous," Hades ground out.
	Hades had stayed for a margin of the remaining’s discussion, but opted for his rooms once he felt their wells of information had run dry.
	“You’re wrong,” Hades growled against her skin.
	“And, something went wrong?” Hades guessed, gently probing at Prometheus’s soul borders, checking for injury.
	He should have-Hades shook his head violently, interrupting that particular train of thought.
	Emet-Selch, I give you my word.” “We should review what we have seen.” Hades looked over to the man, both their emotions had died down but it still lingered in the pair of them.
	Certain that she’d gotten her point across loud and clear to both of them, and Emet-Selch especially, she walked off.
	The more you closely you peer into Hades, the more you realise that the vibrant hue is not simply suffused with his aether... that it is  not  his aether you are seeing at all as it bleeds forth like blood from somewhere endless within.
	“Emet-Selch,” was all he said, addressing the man as he turned to look at him in greeting.
	This time Emet-Selch leaves a tin of tea on his desk.
	Hades pushed past me to grab her outstretched wrist, forcefully pulling her to the side, away from any prying eyes.
	Hades peeled his gaze from the landscape and back to the Warrior, “If there is more you needs’t ask, then by all means, do so.” Hades watched her uncertainty, almost amused by the apprehension in her voice.
	Of the two of them, Hythlodaeus had often been the one to accompany and aid her on her random mini-adventures throughout their fair city while, more times than not, Hades was either the victim of her pranks or simply collateral damage when she might have gotten caught by Lahabrea and Halmarut on more than one occasion while sneaking into the deeper parts of Akadaemia Anyder.
	You wait a moment, like that, because if the person enters there isn’t really a graceful escape, but Hades doesn’t reach down to signal you to stop or say anything.
	Of course, Emet-Selch trusted Venat with Azem, the woman cared for their mutual friend deeply, but something within him rallied against the notion, wanting to be the one to see their recovery through, to be by their side.
	Hades might tell himself later on that he’s only doing this for his own benefit, but she knows him better than to believe such false words.
	Emet took his time, standing up in a labored way, he sauntered over to where she had initiated a step onto the stairs out of the hall.
	As he began to approach, Hades noted that the elezen twins, Exarch, and Gunbreaker still sat around the table, chatting amongst themselves until they noticed him.
	Clearly taking this as an invitation, Hades languidly prowled over to them.
	Emet-Selch raised his hands in a nonchalant shrug.
	“Come on, Hades!
	“Hades, please.” Her brow wrinkled with strain as she came up to the edge, and he did as any good husband should, pushing her off the precipice into an orgasm.
	“You nearly let yourself get swallowed by my aether!” Emet-Selch is scolding her somewhere in the distance, but it seems far away.
	Emet gives you a challenging stare.
	Hades was a fool.
	Emet had alleviated some of her curiosity through questioning, albeit, but she was no further in understanding why it was still happening, nor why Hydaelyn refused to answer her calls, than she was a sennnight ago.
	…It suddenly occurs to him what he’s said, and Emet-Selch quickly follows up his words.
	Hades turned back to the bars, wincing as his head, his chest, pulled upon his wounds.
	As the idyll of their moment in the salon passed, Hades felt the violence rising in him again.
	Which is why your heart is ready to burst out of your chest.” Hades mused, obviously ignoring her every attempt to get him to stop instigating further discourse between those two.
	Aestelle let out a small laugh as she turned in her chair to better see her friends while still holding Hades’ hand.
	My determination to make absolutely sure Emet-Selch was well surprised me, though I chalked it up to Azem merely motivating me, and not wanting to let her down.
	Hades used his soul sight as he made his way to her apartment, in order to make sure she was even there to begin with.
	She can still see the Emet-Selch of that time's expression go from nostalgic joy to eye-rolling annoyance in an instant.
	It made him quiver, abs tensing, pulse picking up as Hades’s hand dipped  lower, thumbing the dark curls of his pubic hair.
	That gives Hades pause, but his grip remains.
	Emet-Selch falls.
	“You can’t stay out here for eternity,” Hades told him, and chanced reaching out.
	Hades hissed.
	For the briefest of moments, she forgot that he was Professor Emet-Selch, and she was his student.
	To your considerable surprise, Hades allows you as much.
	Worst of all was the look within Emet-Selch’s eyes.
	Emet-Selch's arm around you tightens, holding you closely against his chest, and in his other hand, something shimmers.
	Hades rapidly backed up, his hastily erected shield diverting the worst of the boiling slag and chunks of wall thrown up from the explosion coming down on him.
	Hades raised an eyebrow.
	Hades leaned forwards slightly, feeling unnerved at how  unstable  Prometheus was feeling.
	Azem turned on their side, looking up at Emet-Selch.
	Hades sat quietly in his room, glaring down at his swathed hands.
	Step away from Emet-Selch.” I snapped my gaze to hers and raised a brow.
	I believe the very presence of Emet-Selch’s aether all around you may have spurred it to continue, pushing the Echo to continue and reach beyond what it normally would.
	When Emet-Selch attempted to remove his gloves, to touch himself and relieve that exquisitely building ache, the Exarch delivered a sharp, painful smack to the inside of his wrist.
	To her surprise, it is her quiet, honest question that has Emet-Selch almost recoil for a moment.
	Hades could only see the tether when it was about to break, because he needed to keep it from fully doing so.
	Speaking of Emet-Selch,” he paused as he glanced over to her bed where said Ascian is still sleeping soundly, “how has he been in our absence?” “I wonder what it is Emet-Selch will do once he is awake now that he is free from Zodiark’s influence.
	Hades tried not to think about the zoology exam he had by now missed.
	“Hades,” you whimper, struggling in his hold.
	She doesn’t know all too much about Emet-Selch, but she knows what he is, after all.
	Emet-Selch can practically hear your future self sulking in the future, from the present.
	Reaching up to grasp at the amethyst that hangs around her neck, she looked on at Hades.
	Prometheus was moving stiffly, rising from his seat with a careful precision that Hades found suspicious.
	And among them, Hades, your Hades, who has always believed in you and held your words in the highest esteem, he wants to know if you think he doesn’t deserve to be saved.
	Hades paused, not sure if he heard correctly at first.
	Aestelle’s eyes slowly go wide when she comes face to face with Hades who has propped himself up on one elbow to lie on his side, a hand outstretched and grasping at her hair.
	He didn’t care to get involved in  that  volatile situation between Prometheus and Hades, even if it was slightly inappropriate at times.
	And there is this matter of unspoken deliverance, that he—the Ascian and Paragon Emet-Selch—is now your savior.
	"Yes," Hades drawled, "I was busy sleeping, you see."
	But once Hades had poured his aether into her, it became clear that wasn’t quite it.
	Fortunately,  Lahabrea gave him Hades’s number and told him to please sort this out so he wasn’t forced to witness their relationship drama every time they were in the shop together.
	Prometheus didn’t move away - wasn’t  repulsed  - and Hades’s shaking fingers touched his cheek, leaving streaks of black.
	Emet-Selch does not think any of that.
	Hades is going to be upset with her once this is over.
	“W-wait,” Hythlodaeus instructed, grasping Hades’s wrist in one hand, a troublesome smile spreading across his face.
	He sat down on his bed and looked at Emet.
	Such individuals do not exist in the First.” Hades’ said from where he stands at the edge of the arena.
	It was ticking close to nine o’clock - the end of Hades’s shift - when Prometheus  finally  slinked in.
	What does she say to G’raha after running away with Hades and being gone for almost an entire week now?
	Hades had never spoken to him before, nor had Hythlodaeus; most of their interaction with the administration had been limited to the deans of their respective departments.
	Can she honestly give up on them even if they’re going to try and kill Hades anyway?
	“Indulgence, my dear,” Emet-Selch says with an impatient click of his tongue.
	Though the fact that the shade had noticed it and not Emet-Selch himself was perplexing…perhaps it was due to Hythlodaeus’ keen sight that he was able to see it, and that talent had carried on, even in a recreation.
	Emet-Selch mutters, disgusted and resigned, under his breath.
	“Why do mere memories cause you such physical turmoil?” Emet-Selch demanded from beside me, clearly perturbed at the state I was in.
	“You see, I realised, either way, we’re all going to die from this,” Prometheus explained, oblivious or uncaring to Hades’s aether stirring into readiness, “Whether by sacrifice to Zodiark, or to the Doom itself, we’ll die.
	Regardless of her goal changing so that she can save her beloved and her dearest friend, the troubles of the Source haven’t changed at all and she will need to address them when she returns─and this time with Hades by her side.
	I erred greatly and allowed myself to naively believe that only by Emet-Selch’s death wouldst the First be delivered unto salvation...and I admit, I didst not believeth in thine unproven solution to his tempering.
	It had been hours after Hythlodaeus had left, and still nothing from Hades.
	"Emet-Selch, on the other hand, is Dark-aspected.
	“I forgot,” Hades said, a bit stiffly, when Prometheus blinked in surprise at him, “About that.”  Hades lazily kicked his ankle, drawing his attention back, “Is your headache gone?”  Hades just stared at him.
	“That’s a fish,” Hades said, just to be sure.
	"He missed you whenever you left, you know," Hythlodaus says, ignoring the look Emet-Selch sends his way.
	Vala snaps at Emet-Selch and his damnable questions.
	"Clean me off, pet," he purrs against your ear, and as you open your mouth to obey, Emet's cool fingers slip within you, grinding against that front wall and tearing moan after wanton moan from your lips.
	“I for one would like to trust you, since our dear friend seems to,” Alphinaud began, watching the way I had closed the distance between me and Emet-Selch.
	When Emet-Selch draws back ever so slightly to let her gasp for air Cassia finds his eyes.
	I wanted to write this, but with more Ascian bickering, but I also kept reminding myself that this series is supposed to be Emet-Selch centric.
	Hades had told her that despite their sundered brethren following the path Zodiark had set them on, it was clear for him, Lahabrea, and Elidibus to see that they aren’t nearly as determined to honor their dark god as they once were.
	He was Hades.
	"Ah," said Emet-Selch, sounding uncharacteristically caught off-guard.
	Sometimes souls are left to drift up here before plummeting down, other times they’re given another chance at life instantaneously.” Aestelle repeated what Hades and Hythlodaeus had told her so long ago now.
	“It’s not, my dear - my darling,” Hades gasped, giving in to the tension coiling inside him, letting one hand slip from her neck to her breast, rolling it in his hand and tweaking her nipple gently.
	You snuggle yourself against him, feeling pleased and so very content, happy to have been able to give Emet-Selch the same pleasures he has heaped upon you; you only wish Elidibus were here as well to share in the closeness and comfort of this moment.
	“Emet won’t hurt him─there’s no point in it.
	Hades and her continued their high-spirited banter all the way down to the bottom of the Crystal Tower.
	It took Emet little effort to kiss her back, his teeth biting gently into her bottom lip to open up for him.
	"They need time to think," Hades said, flexing his fingers around his chair’s arms.
	Combined with the purring sensations vibrating through their shallow soul-bond, the physical, sensual feel of Hades gently, gently,  gently  worrying his bottom lip had him trapped in a very pleasantly dazed state of  ‘ah this is very nice’.
	This has far surpassed what she lived through previously and has diverged from that timeline entirely, the future where Hades is concerned wholly unknown.
	“Think, Hades.
	Will someone tape Emet-Selch’s mouth shut please.
	As a man, Hades knew leaving the man to his whims meant he would be in for a headache.
	Always he remained fixed on that scrying glass and the unknowing figure in it, up to the very moment he snapped his hips hard and fast, emptying himself into Emet-Selch with a bitten-back cry.
	Slowly, the tendrils caresses you, eliciting a tiny gasp from your lips, breaking away from Emet’s mouth.
	“I’m sorry…” Aeliana lowered her eyes as Emet-Selch let a healing caress of his aether drift over the few lacerations on her arm.
	Hades uncrossed his arms from over his chest while he looked on at the pair walking back down the path of azure flowers.
	Emet-Selch has kept you on edge for so long you have lost track of time a while ago.
	Emet-Selch leaned forward, bracing himself with one hand as the other groped behind him to line up G'raha's slick, hard length, G'raha muttering a plea of please, don't that turned into a low groan as that tight, familiar heat enclosed him.
	Hades looked at him.
	“That is not what you said this morning when I burned the coffee.” Hades snorted and shook his head.
	The link was reestablished, and Hades let out a desperate moan, the sensation of Azem’s cock filling him twice sending him immediately over the edge.
	“I’ll be blunt then,” Hythlodaeus said dryly, “Prometheus, have you and Hades confessed your feelings to each other yet?” If Hythlodaeus knew, did that mean  Hades  knew?
	“You know, I think I’m starting to understand now why you threw away your victory to come back and save Emet.” Ardbert said as they neared Gatetown.
	G'raha's mouth snapped shut as the reality of Emet-Selch's words washed over him, cold as seawater.
	Emet was funny sometimes, either in his reaction to she and Ryne or just in his stories—she really had enjoyed those, perhaps the most.
	“No, she hasn’t,” Hades insisted, purple eyes locking with mine again.
	Emet smiled at her ruefully, conjuring up memories of his own lengthy history.
	The timeline I had been from, we had only learned of Fandaniel once the towers had already been constructed, but now, with Emet-Selch alive, we were learning of him much sooner.
	Emet is narrating as "I" and "you" of course is the same as it's always been.
	Hades didn’t so much as grunt, “I’ve  won~”  “Only an idiot gloats pre-maturely,” Hades purred back just as confidently, and a twinkle of mischief darted through his aether, “Especially when they forget an important detail…” Hades’s true form was heavily reliant on arcane arts, as opposed to physical confrontation.
	Hades can do little but rumble his displeasure in a long, aggravated groan.
	She and the girl were silent for a time, and yet again, Hades could see her glaring out at her blade in annoyance.
	Emet glanced up from the papers briefly, gold brushing against ebony.
	Hades stands alone against you, demanding the return of things once lost.
	You fuss as much as Hades at times and others not nigh enough - an all too familiar internal voice teases, undeniably in truth.
	Hades locked eyes with me, and tilted his head when he saw my face.
	“Half of them are gone, Hades,” I said, my voice unsteady but insistent that he listen to me, anyway.
	“What is it?” Hades averted his eyes from mine, looking down at my chest.
	“You do.” Emet-Selch responds grudgingly, gritting his teeth.
	“I will be leaving you to your work, Emet-Selch.
	Prometheus grumbled, resting his chin on Hythlodaeus’s shoulder to glare better at Hades.
	Emet tries to touch a few, perhaps to create music of his own, but they curl up angrily, and his sneers at them, face dropping into a sullen pout.
	“I’m in a good mood,” Hades said simply.
	Zodiark is yours and Hades is His so Hades is yours, and no one else’s; your will and His are as one.
	“Not that I require outside assistance.” Emet-Selch rolled his eyes and relaxed enough that his arms dropped to his sides while he perched upon a corner of the mattress.
	His dearest will be sorry they missed it and demand every bit of detail he and Hades will be able to offer.
	Gingerly, delicately, Hades brushed the tips of his fingers atop her smaller hand and then round, taking her wrist between his long fingers like a man holding a rod of fragile, broken glass.
	It did not escape the Scions notice that while Emet-Selch did much of the oblique and vague talking, he also spent a great deal of time watching ‘Azem’ interact with their hero.
	When we arrived back to the First, it was quite late, so Hades quickly explained what happened to G’raha Tia, then walked back with me to our room.
	Emet-Selch shook his head and set about tidying a space on the kitchen counter.
	He idly kicked his legs up into the air, “You sure you don’t have narcolepsy, Hades?
	Hades had seen a strange look in Hythlodaeus’s eye as he looked up at the sky, after the ground stopped shaking.
	Yet as if to fool himself and make you forget, Hades takes your mouth to his with a crippling impatience—sharing in your unsteady breath before his tongue bends to steal it back again.
	I will tend to your wounds more thoroughly once we’ve returned to Ala Mhigo.” Hades murmured, already walking off with her held protectively in his arms, not caring one bit that she is covered in blood and surely staining his clothes.
	With a huff, the Warrior of Light placed a hand on her hip, clearing her throat to draw his attention, “Ahem, Good morning, Emet.
	The both of them breathless, Emet-Selch turned the Exarch around on his haunches, facing the display.
	Hades looked down at the miqo’te woman, taking in the state of her hair, and face, with interest.
	“Why must you both be such unforgivable te…tea…tease…h-hnn…” Azem’s body quaked, straining against their restraints as Hades slowly slid the first notch of the sound inside their penis.
	"Technically dead, if you think about it.” With purpose wrest and names laid bare, neither Hades nor Themis truly qualified as the villains they once were.
	“Emet.” Hades corrected.
	Now attuning herself to the diurnal sect, Aestelle attempted to use the healing of the Keeper to remedy the unseen and unknown problem causing Hades aether to act so strangely.
	“Now I’m interested, what did you want to ask?” The curiosity is still in Emet-Selch’s eyes as he leans forward a bit.
	“Perhaps when we aren’t tied down by our offices you may have the privilege of taking me along on some grand adventure.” Hades said as they neared the Hall of Rhetoric The ride up to one of the top floors was spent with Aestelle and Hades bickering back and forth while the Emissary listened on, not adding a thing to the conversation.
	“How are  you going to fight Emet without me there to help you?” “Venat was a bit spiteful towards me declining to join Hydaelyn’s summoning so I don’t think Mother would exactly like having Azem as her beloved champion─especially now that I’m trying to save Hades.
	Everything following from her battle against Hades to fleeing from the Scions and somehow making it to where they are now never exactly allowed her much time to reflect on her talk with Halone.
	When you give Emet the succ so good he goes fucking colorblind.
	Hades sensed something, and turned to find Elidibus leaning against the Orchestrion.
	Aletheia wasn’t surprised that somehow, someway, Emet had plans to lead her through his itinerary.
	All she ever wanted was for her and Hades and Hythlodaeus and Elidibus and all of their friends to be happy.
	“Going to a shady location guided by Emet-Selch is one thing, but to willingly step into one of those dark, Ascian portals?” Thancred balked.
	“It’s quite good, Emet-Selch,” he said with a slight hesitation, the surprise in his tone matching his expression.
	Shaking his head, Hades said, “No, thank you.
	It was...Emet-Selch?
	Lahabrea is sure his prize pupil, Hythlodaeus, will gain the seat of their retiring colleague, Emet-Selch.
	The difference between the two of them was that Hades had been the one to see her body lying torn and tattered at the foot of some awful abomination.
	And yes, Emet is only going to get more protective of his precocious Hythlod-Exarch.
	His friend looked so deceptively vulnerable when he slept, his soul a gentle, warm thing that purred when Hades brushed up against it.
	Hades threw open the door to his office and didn’t bother closing it behind him knowing full well the Emissary will follow after him regardless of if he managed to lock him out.
	So, as he walked, Emperor Solus zos Galvus of the Eternal Empire of Garlemald, Emet-Selch, the Architect, cast an appraising eye over the potential Legati.
	Hades entrusted this to her once more when he gave the Convocations crystals to Hythlodaeus for her to care for after his death.
	Nothing would stop Emet-Selch from saving them.
	Whatever they were doing, they would need to explain themselves and  apologize  before Emet-Selch would cave.
	His friend staggered, the spell sinking its claws in, Hades stepping forwards to catch him- Hades was very still, and Prometheus’s Sigil flared with ominous, red light.
	"You could help her," you say firmly but quietly, and Emet-Selch's eyebrows rise.
	It stood to reason that Emet-Selch might have been infected with such thinking, though the Tempering made betrayal from that corner impossible.
	Hades expression fell as she slipped out of his embrace with ease.
	Elidibus handled that task, and it gave Hades time for this personal errand - finding Prometheus.
	You watch, now completely entranced, as Emet-Selch bobs up and down along Elidibus’s cock as he sucks; the Ascian has neither a gag reflex nor a need to breathe, letting his throat constrict around the swollen head with each swallow, intent on pleasuring rather than teasing.
	I then looked to Emet-Selch who, despite having his same white hair, looked drastically different from the one in my memories.
	I dunno, I could also just be biased and because we got cute Emet time this turned into one of my fave chapters as well xD In a daze, Aestelle slowly opens her eyes and finds that she had fallen asleep in her chair, resting her upper body on the bed while Hades continues to sleep.
	It is both ridiculous and strangely exciting, she thinks, to realize that despite everything his magic is doing to her, Emet-Selch still sits out of her reach and fully clothed as he watches her over the rim of his glasses.
	Back to the cave, to Emet-Selch's voice, even with all its condescension.
	The glare she gives Hades is a promise of retribution.
	“Honestly the person you speak of is so far from the Emet-Selch I’m familiar with.
	Emet-Selch's focus shifted until he could see that the man's aether, even considering the mutilated state its grafting to the Tower had left it in, was withered and drawn-in around itself.
	She’s picking up Hades’ bad habits it seems and getting far better at lying than what she’s comfortable with.
	As much as he was seductive, Emet could be persuasive when he wanted to be - or unintentionally.
	“There,” Emet-Selch whispers to him, stroking his bruised cheek with a gloved hand.
	Before you can press your lips against his, you feel the tingling of the aetheric sense granted you by the Echo and a mere instant later the space beside you is wreathed in black and violet as a portal opens, depositing Emet-Selch into the room.
	Emet-Selch’s hand was holding my hair out of my face as he crouched next to me, observing me.
	Hades straightened, brushing the collar of his coat flat.
	Saving Emet-Selch and Elidibus dost not require our intercession.” Her fellow astrologian said, patiently waiting for her to take the crystal in his hands.
	“A useful talent.” Hades continued despite her lack of a response, gaze inquisitive as he judges her.
	You, who hide behind glamours and shadows while I stand with my heart laid bear!” The Exarch started to speak but Thancred stepped in front of him, between him and Emet.
	When Meli had chosen her crepe stand and Hades accepted her rolanberry-and-chocolate treat, we sat at a small, nearby table for customers.
	“Would you like to dance, Lady (L/N)?” Hades asked abruptly.
	Emet-Selch merely stared down at him a moment before sighing.
	“I should let you suffer to teach you a lesson,” Hades grumbled, but as usual he was all bark and no bite.
	And those are the worst—his head feels like it’ll explode like an overripe watermelon, sobbing and drooling in Emet-Selch’s lap as he pleads stop, stop, stop.
	“Fuck fuck fuck  fuck fuck…  ” Prometheus babbled mindlessly, shaking like a leaf as Hades popped off his cock with a wet, obscene noise, his soul radiating a smug sense of ‘very pleased with himself’.
	"It would be appropriate for you to call me Hades."
	Hythlodaeus beckoned him closer, placing his fingers over the aetheric mark he had placed upon Hades.
	Your soul is the most enchanting thing I have ever laid eyes on,” Hades rasps onto burning skin, grasping your waist and roughly dragging you against the smooth, dampened silk to pin you beneath him.
	Distracted as he is, Hades doesn’t register Helios’s return until a slick fingertip press against his entrance, earning a surprised gasp that becomes muffled into Hythlodaeus’s skin.
	Hades turned to look at Lahabrea once more, the white-robed youth in his arms showing no signs of waking up.
	“And pray tell, how far away is very far?” asked Emet-Selch, his tone one of only mild interest and it quickly became clear that he’d opted to change his strategy.
	“The crystal has taken less of you then I thought,” Emet said and the Exarch looked over his shoulder.
	“Well, it seems we are both eager to fulfill our duties, then,” Emet-Selch said as his conversation with the Exarch drew to a close.
	“Please what hero?” Hades teased fingers toying with the now damp fabric of her underwear.
	I am Hades.
	“I think he has aether poisoning,” Hades said, “Hmm, might need to make him throw up some more.” For him, he blinked, and suddenly he was naked in a bath with Hades rubbing a damp towel through his hair.
	It was always some arbitrary bet as well, something Hades would doubtlessly come out on top in so he couldn’t refuse.
	For once, Emet-Selch is the one who is seduced.
	There was no doubt that if it had, Emet had a hand in it.
	Rather, it was Emet-Selch’s aether itself.
	"Or," Hythlodaeus chimes in before Emet-Selch can call for their mentor.
	A smile far too sweet on her lips before she strode past him back down the hill where Hermes and Meteion waited, and all Emet-Selch could do was watch her walk away until he was certain that she was out of earshot.
	Hades finally stopped pacing in order to glare at it, but in the end, grumbled and accepted.
	And with that, Hythlodaeus too turned away and ambled down the slope, leaving Emet-Selch with no other option than to follow.
	Or, did he somehow believe Emet-Selch was at risk of betraying the Ascians, now that he was playing nice with the Scions?
	His grin is one you suspect Hades might be giving you, were his face visible.
	It is a chilling thought, knowing that for all his seemingly immeasurable power, even someone like Emet-Selch is bound to certain things.
	“I didn’t, no, but mayhaps Emet-Selch—” Somehow, she hadn’t even sensed his approach until she ended up trapped between them with Hythlodaeus’ gorgeous violets twinkling mischievously, and Emet-Selch’s gravelly words reaching her ears.
	Now that he was afforded a curfew, Hades supposed he could spend a modicum of his time satisfying his curiosities regarding the Tower.
	Her pearl white eyes flicker over to the clouded fog that hides Hades’ recreation of their home, the faintest of lights shimmering behind the gloom.
	It occurs to you, finally, that with all of the pleasure he and Elidibus have given you tonight, Emet-Selch has taken none of his own, and you feel yourself flushing at how selfish you’ve been.
	The gunbreaker’s jaw clenched for a moment as Emet-Selch’s smile widened, provoking him to open his mouth once more.
	Emet-Selch observes, remembering a friend long lost.
	Emet-Selch reached his hand out after she’d put the tray down on the table.
	“You don’t want him.” Hades ran his gloved fingers down her spine where it was revealed by her gown.
	How could they insist Hades has to die after she saved him?
	Emet-Selch groaned, tilted his head back, and growled through clenched teeth, "Fuck me.
	“And yet you don’t seem convinced that she will join us, despite you saying she is regaining her old self.” Elidibus pointed out, earning a shrug from Emet-Selch in response.
	“You’re in a very bad mood today,” Hades observed.
	Hades narrowed his eyes slightly at her while he once again crossed his arms over his chest.
	It was the sole bright spot in Hades’s day, honestly.
	Honestly, from writing the prologue out of grief after finishing 5.3 to writing this chapter and thinking of all the chapters yet to come, it's astonishing to think this fic has truly gotten so out of hand and so quickly at that xD On the bright side, with the climax of Hades fate nearing its conclusion, that means Elidibus is soon to be joining the chaos.~ Can't wait for that hell lul As Ardbert guessed, their answer to saving Hades was found in the heavens.
	Hades gave Olivier a sly grin.
	Emet-Selch watches the two of them.
	Even if he was going to let Hythlodaeus deal with the Warrior of Light in his own way, when left to his own devices Emet-Selch would not simply hold the ball and wait for Hythlodaeus to ask for it.
	Out of the corner of his eye, Hades could see the Warrior of Light standing with her arms crossed, ears flattened angrily against the top of her head.
	"Your hospitality is not what I am principally fond of," said Emet-Selch primly.
	Emet-Selch scoffs.
	It was odd to see Hades like this: no discernable wound in his middle, where you had pierced him with coalesced light.
	You see Emet-Selch smile when you lean your full weight back, relaxing against them -- against  him  -- and it doesn’t feel nearly as odd as you would have guessed.

	“Look,” Hades said, deciding to be blunt, “If you don’t want to collaborate with me, you only have to say.” I’m not…” Prometheus trailed off when Hades gave him a firm look, and finally his shoulders dropped as he meekly bowed his head, pressing his fingers together.
	“Hm,” Hades studied him for a moment, “You feel tired.” “I wish you’d have someone sit in here while you do it,” Hades muttered, “In case anything went wrong.” Hades hesitated, but after a moment he carefully knelt down beside him, adjusting his robes neatly around him.
	Emet-Selch blinks at the intrusion; the Warrior of Darkness returns earlier than expected, continuing to run mortal errands.
	!” Hades exclaimed in disbelief, feeling a hand other than Hythlodaeus’s stroking his cock lovingly.
	“The longer it remains inside of you, the more uncomfortable it will become, no doubt,” the Exarch said, words nearly identical to Emet-Selch’s.
	A lingering ache pricked in Emet-Selch’s palms, so vigorous had he been in his punishing administration that scarlet blots still tainted his otherwise pale skin.
	With a smile, Emet-Selch draws back further, giving you room to breathe as he looks down on you.
	Emet-Selch clenched his hands, a pain so visceral it was almost numbing piercing through his heart at the thought of- of Prometheus  not remembering.
	You’d attained your seat at the Convocation and had worked hard to get Hades as the one recommended for Emet-Selch’s seat.
	Waiters and waitresses that addressed Emet by name, and attended to his glass of wine to ensure that it was never empty.
	Unflinching as he stared her down and Emet-Selch curled his fingers to ball a fist at his side.
	He’s not a liar, but he still doesn’t admit to himself that if you never call him Hades… he thinks that might be okay.
	Emet grins filthily, “Who knew the Warrior of Light was such a minx.
	“So, that toy of yours, the beads,” Hades started before Prometheus could fully drift off, “Is that a Private Concept you’ve approved of or…?”  Prometheus hummed and drowsed of after that, his mind already thinking of a good way to ‘introduce’ Hades first hand to those beads.
	There’s a chiding in your voice that makes Hades’s hands tighten on your thighs, clenching and kneading into muscle with a delightful strength, a relieving pain that releases tension.
	Emet-Selch sneered, pulling her close enough that she could feel his breath on her face.
	"But they  stay  on Hades' thighs."
	At this point she doesn’t even think Hades is sleeping.
	“Don’t bother,” Emet-Selch says with a dismissive note.
	“Trust me, there are no pictures of that, it was long before my time as a Garlean Emperor.” Emet-Selch eyes her carefully “But this is not why you are actually here,” he says with an expectant look.
	“Too much?” Hythlodaeus questioned quietly, stroking Hades’s hair—a shake of the head received in answer.
	Decision made, Hythlodaeus raced after Hades, down towards the heaving, aether of a newborn, fake God.
	Only the reality of your own subsequent shame and the actual potential fallout stay his hand, but when the fallout means your ruin just as much as his, Hades needs no further incentive.
	“If you won’t listen to me, hero,” Emet-Selch said softly from behind my chair.
	Amaurotine!WoL/Emet-Selch (Kinda Porny) Hades only realised this when he opened the front door to it and almost stepped into a  furnace.
	Emet-Selch's arm secures around her waist and pulls her back down on top of him.
	“I’m not his keeper, Emet-Selch.” Her tone is sharp, and Emet-Selch takes the hint.
	Hades sighed, “Prometheus…” He was clearly distressed, the emotion becoming more defined the more he spoke, and Hades decided to set aside the lecture for now.
	Hades gave him a heavy-lidded stare for his feigned obliviousness.
	“Now, love,” Hades is grinning wickedly, just as you knew he had wanted to, the terrible man, “It seems I have a favor to return, no?” “You can return the favor at home, Hades.” “Home, Hades.” Hades lifts the corner of his lips in that half-smile you adore so much.
	You’d thought to yourself more than once that Emet-Selch seems to be reading your mind, but you didn’t truly believe it in a literal sense.
	Hades’s body arched, a moan rumbling deep within his chest as he felt Azem slide into him, their hand still around his stuffed cock.
	The energies of Creation coalesce in Hades' hands.
	“Well, this is subtle.” Azem remarked with a dry smile, looking at the mask in her hands and waving it to Emet-Selch, who was leaning against the office door.
	He groaned as he controlled himself, a dry orgasm rocking his body as he ground against the toy, savoring the thought of how helpless his dear Hades was in his office.
	You shake your head  no, to which Emet-Selch seems to mutter something that sounds like "stubborn."
	Hades cannot stifle the hitch in his throat as you work your hips into him, then moving a hand to stroke over his shaft.
	If she manages to save Hades, she doesn’t have the faintest idea how she is ever going to get them to play nice with one another.
	Hades could find her anywhere she went, and without certain precautions he would have easily tracked her down by now.
	Just as you must,” Elidibus replied, glossing over what Emet-Selch had said to him only moments prior.
	Emet-Selch had longed for it so; in that darkness, in those hours, no matter how he had despised the Light.
	Internally, Emet-Selch was delighted.
	If Hades should still be near-- With Persephone basically in heat and Tempered!Hades pursuing her I see how this moves into dubious consent or maybe non-con territory.
	Emet-Selch’s form lies still on the bed, half under the covers,his arm resting over the pillow.
	“Hades, my love, not so tightly,” an achingly familiar voice said softly, with the slightest hint of a laugh, the pitch and lilt of it one that I had not heard in eons.
	Relief flooded Hades instantaneously, and he put a hand to his head, only to feel the anger again.
	He caressed the heavy swells of her breasts, her nipples hardening against his palm before bending down to pull one into his mouth, laving the swollen hardness, feeling her body contort and squirm beneath him, “Emet—“ she gasped.
	She had known him as Hades long before she knew him as Emet-Selch.
	I looked at Hades again with a raised brow.
	“You know…” Emet-Selch starts, glancing away out the window himself, “It would be much easier if you kept your hair down, or at least not bound so high.
	You startle, head whipping down to find Emet-Selch studying you curiously.
	Elidibus was the person she was closest to most after Hythlodaeus and Hades...and she truly loved him as she did them.
	Hades… Emet-Selch is still that man.
	“Do not fight Vauthry,” comes the whispered and muffled prayer teetering on command, Emet-Selch’s face virtually buried into your hair and shoulder.
	Emet-Selch, though, isn’t just anyone, and while his eyes flash dangerously for a moment as he clenches and unclenches his jaw with a slight wince, he is quick to find a semblance of calm again.
	Long lashes loom heavily over tired eyelids; in a vulnerability so slight and fleeting that it might be gone in a breath, Emet-Selch’s shoulders slump further, posture settling deep into his robes.
	“You say all this as if you had no intention to stop me after the first shard,” Emet shrugs, “And here we are, fourteen of them later and you aren’t poised to stop me yet.
	Hades raised an eyebrow, so you clarified, “I can’t return to the Crystarium while Elidibus is searching for me; that would place too many bystanders in harm’s way.
	From his place beside you, Hades had neither moved nor spoken up, and he wasn’t looking at you, either.
	After we ate, Hades insisted that we begin to prepare to head to the shard.
	And yet Emet-Selch is taking advantage of that fact, only his golden eyes visible in the darkness of your room within the Crystarium.
	He inclined his head to me and started following Hades into the Ocular.
	Emet-Selch sighs.
	All too soon, those arms around me vanished, and I looked up with my tear-streaked face to see Emet-Selch looking quite as annoyed as I’d ever seen him, a grimace on his face as he stared incredulously and unimpressed at Thancred, who pointed his gunblade at him.
	“Why won’t you just admit that you love her?” Hades asked without removing his eyes from Amaurot’s skyline, the malice in his words gone.
	“If you need release so badly, why not fill Hades further?” Hythlodaeus asked deviously as he himself straddled the toy, bringing the tip to his own entrance.
	In those moments, Emet-Selch needs you to suffer.
	Emet-Selch and Solus van Galvus are one and the same person - and he had spent the last few months lying to her about almost everything.
	Emet-Selch can, at least, maintain some semblance of dignity.
	Emet rose a brow and looked around.
	“Please,” she murmurs on his lips, “Emet.” Be specific,” Emet grins, lips near her ear now, “Tell me what more do you want?
	Emet-Selch hated to crush it, but he deserved his honesty.
	After a moment, Hades closed his eyes and sighed.
	Emet had planted the ideas of indelicacy without even breathing a word of it.
	You are barely able to slide out of Emet-Selch’s hold when he appears, moving like water to flow to the other side of the room.
	Hades feels your soul still, wanting him.
	“Oh, he’s much too sensitive for a man willing to intrude on a stranger’s bedroom without an invitation.” Emet-Selch did not expect her to say that.
	Hades, for the life of him, could not remember why Azem had settled on such an image for Hyth.
	Emet-Selch’s golden stare burned into me for what felt like an eternity, before he began shaking his head and allowed his shoulders to fall into their signature slouch once more.
	“Try as I might, Emet-Selch,” he murmured, lowering his hand.
	Hades says something after breaking away, when—like a fool—your mouth drifts to follow, to taste him once more for you could never get enough.
	“Who?” Hades stared up into his beloved’s eyes again.
	“Because you have exams,” they said, and Hades’s breath caught, because he had never in his life heard something so foolish.
	“I can’t believe I didn’t realize,” you croak, “so wrapped up in my own head, so absorbed with my task, wrapped around Emet-Selch's finger…” “Although you should save your best punches for Emet-Selch’s smug face.” The matter of Emet-Selch was something else entirely, and you sensed neither of you had heard all there was to see in that matter.
	“Your essence, Emet-Selch,” He stated, “Surely you have seen it, attuned as you are?”  Hades clenched his fists, of course he’d know.
	Vaguely he was aware that his mouth was moving, attempting to form words, “Emet-Selch, Emet are you alright?” Hades groaned as the pair on either side of him marched on, his chest aflame with white, hot agony.
	Hades felt satisfaction.
	Hades looked down as well, noting that his own violet essence was shimmering, pulsing; deep within, he could see the stakes that chained together his aether diminishing, fading.
	"Tantalizing enough to get the blood pumping but nowhere near enough to promise any release," Emet-Selch murmurs as he spreads three fingers in your ass.
	No, Emet-Selch knew what his friend had in mind and wove his magic with elegance and precision.
	Emet-Selch’s expression dulled, “Straight to business I see, very well, hero.” He gazed around, clicking his tongue thoughtfully.
	Then, I have something extremely important to discuss with you.” When he nodded his understanding, I grabbed ahold of Hades and Gaia so we could be on our way, Nero still gaping at us as we left the building.
	Hades watched him from beneath his eyelashes.
	Looking up at the ceiling, feeling the arms wrapped around him, warm and bent just the way from his memories, Hades speaks.
	Raising an eyebrow, Hades shook it, two fingers in her tiny palm.
	A soft laugh filled his mind, “Emet-Selch.” Hades blood ran cold, his own miniscule spirit retreating and bowing in upon itself, hiding from the power he felt now reaching and tugging around from within him, searching, learning.
	Hythlodaeus had always had a sharp mind and a cool wit, something Hades had only despised about half the time when he was subject to it.
	“The quicker we get to Emet-Selch, the sooner you’ll be cured so let’s not waste any more time.” Home is so close─Hades is so close.
	“If I may, I am also in agreement that there is more than meets the eye with regards to Emet-Selch.” “But I'll be watching you closely, Emet-Selch.” “This is my room, Emet-Selch,” she reminded me, her tone brazen.
	Emet takes one step, then two, carefully closing the small distance that separates you.
	Emet continues to bother the Exarch, yet no one is surprised.
	Not that the Exarch wanted Emet around as he slept.
	It did mean it never stagnated, there was always some new hurdle for them to overcome in some way (normally a hurdle of their own making), and, if anything, Hades and Prometheus enjoyed their arguments and disagreements in some weird way.
	I entrust the safekeeping of our family to you, Hades.
	The ride up is near silent as Emet-Selch leans on one side of the lift, opposite the other two.
	We are listening.” Y’shtola said, looking on at Hades with slightly narrowed eyes.
	You flinch, but it is not from pain but rather from the thoroughly new sensations running through your body when Emet-Selch spreads his fingers inside you.
	“Then logic dictates that Hades is the soul who will build the city to greatness,” Hythlodaeus continued with a smile in his voice.
	At long last, Emet-Selch is home.
	Emet-Selch could instinctively feel the corners of his mouth turn down.
	Chewing his lip, Hades leaned against the desk and looked into the fireplace, letting the dancing flames distract his vision while he considered.
	Hythlodaeus knew Hades had to deny it.
	Gaze cast to the stone path beneath her sandals so she wouldn’t have to see the sympathy Hythlodaeus held for her, the curiosity that lingered in Venat’s blues, or the growing frustration on Emet-Selch’s face.
	“Will you now keep to your half of our bargain?” Emet-Selch asks quietly, and you glance over at him, startled.
	There is still so much that can go wrong between now and her fight against Hades and later Elidibus that she doesn’t even want to envision what their grand finale might look like anymore.
	“Hades!
	“Lover, actually.” Aestelle helpfully supplied, her smile only widening when Hades and Edmont both looked down at her in surprise.
	Another time – any other time – and Emet-Selch would be quite pleased to tell the man what he thought of his earlier disdain, deride his faithlessness, and finish off with a healthy insistence that Lahabrea keep this curiosity out of his affairs – But Emet-Selch is, frankly speaking, not at all there.
	It had been a close thing, so very close; Y’shtola was nearly lost to you… but for the intervention of Emet-Selch, who asked nothing in return for the gift of your friend’s life.
	He shielded his face and shouted in surprise, and when he dared open his eyes again Emet-Selch was gone.
	Why yes, I was enabled by the wonderful people over at  Emet-Selch's Wholesomely Debauched Book Club and you're free to join us in Discord whether you write your own or simply read FFXIV fanfic!
	The balmy breeze whispers cool along the wet trails on your skin and suddenly Emet-Selch reaches to grasp your hand, cupping it with both of his much larger ones.
	“That’s my name, Hades.
	“Emet-Selch?” Hades frowned as the grief, hot and acidic, began to color over the cesious sheen he witnessed before him.
	Hythlodaeus petted Azem’s hair as they took Hades’s desperate pounding.
	A serene and far too wholesome smile on his face while Emet-Selch’s foot slid up to stroke along the back of Aeliana’s calves and set her nerves on fire.
	“Why did you write this letter and have Hythlodaeus send it to me, if you thought I was going to say no?” Hades asked, a strangely teasing lilt to his voice, “It’s not like you to give up so quickly.” Hades’s expression was still difficult to read, but there was something considering in his heavy-lidded gaze, like he had discovered an attractive quality he hadn’t noticed before in Prometheus.
	“Not really,” Hades mumbled into his arms, “We are what we are, and we know what our purpose is.
	What Emet-Selch wrought pales in comparison to the real thing.
	Hades hesitated but slowly leaned over.
	Hades sagged against the nearby wall, weak from the power he’d exerted.
	Emet-Selch wasn’t sure if this was a good or a bad thing yet.
	This had become their normal routine—Hades, reading or researching whilst in the hero’s presence, normally outside, she working through exercises or training with her comrades on the Lakeland battlegrounds.
	Hades followed her, watching silently as she removed her light silk robe and began digging through her armoire.
	Azem says, and Emet-Selch can't help flushing to the tips of his ears because he absolutely knows the intention behind the statement.
	Especially not when, with another snap, Emet-Selch’s gloves disappear, and his hands are back on her.
	Hythlodaeus cackles in delight, a clear contrast to Emet-Selch’s scowl.
	Before Hades could give much thought to the position, Hythlodaeus took Azem and Hades’s shafts together in one hand and began to stroke.
	“So, do you have other questions?” she continued, “Or are you going to sit through this whole meal and just give me brooding, hungry looks?” The (R/N) woman lifted a spoonful of the consommé that Hades had completely forgotten to her mouth.
	Hades was half-tempted to just force the curtains open again, no doubt goading Prometheus into a childish battle of wills until they were both wide awake, but he felt too… something.
	There was a muffled sound of shock, but afterward, Azem wasted no time in throwing their weight into the kiss, arms flung around Emet-Selch’s neck, kissing back with fervor, eclectic against him, nearly fevered with desire, hot against them, positively thrumming.
	"Zodiark  commands  me to…"  Hades can't quite find the words.
	Emet-Selched dropped his tea.
	“We...take Emet-Selch up on his offer,” I said with finality.
	Giving me your blessing?” Emet-Selch struggled to think of the appropriate word, waving his hand vaguely as his expression soured.
	And Emet-Selch smiles.
	With his utmost focus, Hades bore down upon a set to his left, tethered to his rib, and began to will his magicks to his shoulder, his forearm, fingers.
	Still, Emet wished he could play with the fine hair of the Exarch’s ears in this moment, tucked away under that hood.
	“You are mine, (Y/N).” Hades pulled her close for a kiss, then wriggled out of his own clothes, leaving them in a pile beside the bed.
	Then Hades takes a steady stride towards a dark corner of the room, into the shadows and you cannot see but only trust your gut that he is chasing you off into a portal.
	Hades’ voice was barely a whisper.
	He directed his aetheric tendrils around both Azem and Hades’s bodies as he settled into a sensuous pace, denying Azem any control over their thrusts into Hades.
	Hades does not look up from his desk when you entreat upon him.
	Hades has to fully crane his neck down to look at her with how close they are, the younger girl only coming up to his chest just as she did back then.
	And Hades in particular – well, he just loves to be pushed.
	Sparing her a fleeting glance, Hades gripped the amber around his neck just a little harder before stepping into his portal, leaving Aestelle to gaze up at the stars just as she used to.
	“I did not realize every action of mine was to be classified as an Ascian endeavor,” Emet-Selch retorted, pinching the bridge of his nose and letting his shoulders fall into an exhausted slump.
	Thankfully, after so many predecessors tweaking and adjusting Amaurot, Hades had little to do on that front as the current Emet-Selch, but he still had to do the occasional examination of it every few centuries or so, just to ensure it remained on course.
	He was familiar, but Emet-Selch couldn’t place him-not a Scion?
	Hades began to build up his aether, searching for the chains, the spaces, which he’d sensed in her from his prison.
	On his other side, Lahabrea barely breathed as he watched, then exchanged a glance with Hades.
	Hades prized self-control, so probably didn’t want to risk losing it by indulging in physical pleasure when Prometheus was right here.
	It is a sad thing, Emet-Selch muses as he approaches you, dark aether like a stain upon the desert.
	It is not a question, but Emet-Selch gives her the smallest of nods nonetheless.
	Your mind races malms a minute as you wait in the queue, wondering at what Emet is trying to show you.
	“You would think human bodies would regulate temperature better,” Emet-Selch snarked.
	He laughed quietly when Hades slanted a narrow-eyed stare in Prometheus's direction, a crackle of tension forming between them.
	Emet-Selch was wise to leave quickly, for now I fear each word might ruin the suspense of the act.” These words elicited a raised eyebrow and consternation as he stood.
	You’ll let Emet-Selch put you in this state because you’re weak to him, so weak, but if he wants you to talk about how desperate you are to have him touch you, he’s another thing coming.
	I didn’t want to wake you, and Olivier came in to ask which armor I wanted prepared…” She reached for Hades, tentatively, and he caught her hand and pulled her close.
	I elbowed Hades in the side, interrupting his conversation as she flicked her wrist, a clean, dry towel appearing in her free hand.
	My beloved Hades...I wish I could fix this mess on my own…” ‘Twould appear our hypothesis was correct and you, Azem, are the lifeline keeping Emet-Selch here in the world of the living and preventing his soul from giving out.” “Let us focus on Emet-Selch for the time being.
	“Not quite what I had in mind but entertaining nonetheless.” Hythlodaeus studied Hades, a brow raised, as the man worked Azem’s length with his mouth.
	“Judging by yours and Lord Edmont’s words, this man has since perished.” Hades murmured, his arms around her stomach tightening ever so slightly to hug her as best he can.
	Finally, Hades slides back, laying in the water, staring listlessly upwards.
	You always are there to rescue me, Hades.
	With a snap of his fingers, Hades started the flame, but let it grow on its own as he sat down.
	The Ascian known as Emet-Selch sighed heavily and ran a hand through his hair.
	“Perhaps we will be able to catch up with them.” He held hope while Hades scowled.
	His arms laid crossed atop his chest, tightening as his gaze met Hades’.
	He made sure to lean in to whisper at a volume that Emet-Selch would no doubt still hear.
	Hades felt his mood darken considerably.
	"I won't leave you Emet-Selch."
	Emet chuckles this time, the sound circling around you as he continues to move.
	Emet chuckles, crawling up your body to kiss you lazily.
	Emet-Selch has also carefully pulled out of his lover’s body and by now arranged himself comfortably beside Elidibus, nuzzling at his throat to gently lick over the bite marks he’d left earlier.
	“I’m sorry that this is how we meet again,” she says, and next to Cassia, Emet-Selch takes a deep breath.
	Perhaps it’s the battle still raging in your system, your distrust and hate boiling over, because before you can stop yourself you fling your mug of cooling tea at Emet-Selch’s smirking face.
	Normally, this was when he called Hades ‘boring’ and wandered off to swing off a branch like a monkey, but instead he asked; “Okay, so, what do you want to do instead?” Hades eyed him, genuinely surprised.
	“Really, Hades-”  When Emet-Selch had departed once more, taking the Exarch with him, Thancred pushed through the crowd of Scions as they were frozen in stunned silence, rushing to my bedside.
	“Emet-Selch!” Iris squeaks, recognizing the convocation mask and bowing her head respectfully.
	"That," Emet-Selch interrupts you a bit  too  fast, "is not true.
	The rest of her is worried because the heavy weight of Emet-Selch's gaze has turned piercing and she knows the odds of her winning this are slim to none.
	You followed whom you believed to be Hades around the corner, into what appeared to be a small park.
	Hythlodaeus had always been logical, but he had a different way of doing things than Hades did.
	Emet gave no answer, merely glowered at him before turning on his heels and walking out the door.
	A dizziness overtakes him, as if floating; at that instant, Emet-Selch releases him, and he heaves like a drowned man for the precious commodity of air.
	She takes a moment to study her before looking back at Emet-Selch.
	“I will do this, if you want me to, but…” Hades glanced askance for a moment.
	“It should be feasible, yes.” Hades crossed his arms, still examining the portal.
	Not even you, Emet.” Emet here helped in healing your sister and myself.
	Over the span of his life as Solus, Emet-Selch would know more pain than happiness.
	“Curious enough, isn’t it, Emet-Selch, how your Warrior now sits in Altima’s place, instead of Halmarut’s?” The crystal glowed at his command, a stream of purple light flowing towards Hades.
	The Mistress is doing so herself at the moment.” Without further explanation, he turned, leading Hades out of the library and back to his rooms.
	“Go, Hades,” Cronus insisted.
	“Hades,” she whispers in a quiet plea, and in an instant, his arms are around her, his fingers entangling themselves with her hair as he holds her close and his forehead gently rests against hers.
	Emet-Selch offered to let me retract the bargain I made,” you say, and watch your friends’ eyes widen.
	Hades clicked his tongue.
	Emet-Selch had spotted a rather nice area for resting, and so rather than waste even more energy making the trip there, he snapped his fingers and soon they were on the tallest part of a nearby mountain, sitting in the fields of grass overlooking a village below.
	His friend didn’t flinch away from him, and Hades hesitated before slowly sinking into Prometheus’s soul, helping him compartmentalise that awful  fear  and  terror  into a tiny little box, to fester quietly out of sight for a little while.
	This entire time I’ve been saying that Emet has never been our enemy and I meant it.” Emet and the other Ascians have killed millions, ended entire worlds, and have sown the seeds of chaos everywhere they have ever walked.
	The cool, jagged crystal of the Ocular’s walls now pressed against his back, holding the brunt of Hades’ weight rather than Astrologian and miqo’te’s shoulders.
	“You enjoyed that,” Hades sulked.
	After you collapsed, Emet vanished.” He said and then sighed.
	This is what Emet-Selch had been seeing in his mind as he created his lonely bastardization, what he had been longing for as he walked those empty streets.
	“Now, be a good boy and finish…” Hades purred, settling back and pressing his hands against his knees, keeping Prometheus’s thighs spread wide, “Go on.
	They scattered upon Hades’s approach, and he looked down at the remains of the creature.
	Her mouth is  hot  and Hades learns immediately she is not entirely the gentle-hearted little rebel he thought her to be.
	If you were to discover the Warden and she to absorb it...” His attention slid to Emet-Selch for a moment, who shook his head.
	Hades’s breathing audibly stuttered, a twist of foriegn warmth rippling through their shallow bond and making Prometheus’s toes curl.
	Hades nodded, casting a glance over the spring, “In that case, let’s go somewhere where we can sit on  chairs like civilised people, as opposed to this horrible floor.
	If they knew she wanted to instead detemper Hades and not kill him, then they’d ask questions.
	Hades flinched, an immense well of agony and grief filling him where the connected pain could not, “Damn this war, the Source.
	“Hades?
	Hades' hand against the small of her back and atop one well-muscled thigh (he  knew  the man wouldn't be able to resist for long) to guide her.
	“Aren’t you?” Hades asked.
	“Strange,” Hades said, lifting his head-  “Stay here!” Hades barked, already pivoting on his heel and rushing out of his office.
	Hades put an arm around her as she drifted to his side, and he pressed his lips to the top of her head.
	Absence makes the heart grow fonder – Hades knows this to be true, he knows it well.
	When Emet-Selch walked out of the darkness, Runar’s scouts were immediately on high alert, quickly knocking arrows into their bows.
	Part of him held hope that Azem would be convinced at the dissipation of the Final Days and return to Hades’ side.
	Hades brow furrowed as he watched their exchange.
	As Emilia drank down her flask of water, Hades also noticed she wasn’t wearing anything particularly dark today as well; her top was off-white, billowy and far, far too big for her.
	I stretched for a few more minutes until I felt it was sufficient, then sat on the ground with my back against the tree as I watched Ryne and Thancred dance around each other with weapons drawn, the sound of Emet-Selch’s pen once more scratching along the paper in my ears.
	To Emet-Selch’s considerable surprise,  I  suggested that we rest before going to Mt.
	Just as Hades shoulders his burden, so too shall she.
	Hades needs to save Y’shtola from the Lifestream and there’s no getting around this if there’s any hope in helping him gain the favor of her friends... He’s no different from her or Hades in that regard.
	Deserved on both accounts, as far as Emet-Selch is concerned.
	A sudden idea pops into your mind and you gaze upon both Emet-Selch and Hythlodaeus with eager eyes.
	A picture of a man with white hair and amber eyes, smiling warmly - he looked familiar, almost like Emet-Selch, but… the differences were too much for them to be anything but distant relatives.
	Emet-Selch's hold on you becomes impossibly tight.
	Hades leaned against the frame of the portal as Ryne talked animatedly, watching her closely.
	“Why, yes, make yourself at home,” Hades drawled as Prometheus summoned bags of ingredients from his personal inventory and dumped them on his kitchen counters, “I don’t mind.” “Oh, hi, Hades,” Prometheus said, rummaging about in the ingredient bag, “You going to join in for once?
	Giving one last swipe of his tongue, Hades kissed his way back up her body.
	Hades watched on as purpled aether swelled into the chain, mingling with the blued luminosity of the blessing he felt ever present upon the latter half of his body.
	Sometimes disappointment is all Emet-Selch can feel these days.
	Hades hums in agreement, "Indeed, and because of that she’ll always drag us around one way or the other."
	“Hades!” Endymion greets upon his arrival, cyan eyes bright even under the cover of his mask.
	“Emet-Selch, must I remind you why it is we have become something akin to friends in these recent decades?”  Without a word Hades kept walking, nearing his office at the end of the long hallway.
	You can’t think of anything that Emet-Selch, Elidibus, and the others might do with you that is worse than the deaths of your friends at your own hand, but right now you admittedly can’t think of much at all besides the pain of containing the boiling Light, so you’re willing to allow that there could well be something you’re overlooking.
	“I didn’t mean to frighten you, Hades.
	“I will be quite fine!” Emet-Selch insisted, putting the thought of his filled derriere out of his mind.
	For this does Hades rise once again as Emet-Selch, and resolve to accept his duties once more, despite your absence.
	I looked up at Hades with wide eyes.
	Upon entering the room, Emet-Selch’s eyes immediately found the tablet we had brought with us.
	He and Emet-Selch stare at one another, sharing looks that she cannot read.
	The creatures down there, Hades.
	“Isn’t that right, Emet-Selch?”  Azem tossed their head back, their laughter once again filling the air, filling Emet-Selch’s own heart.
	Emet-Selch sighs.
	Emet-Selch couldn’t lie to you.
	Hades felt tears drip down his face as he looked upon the mask in his hands, cracked and caked with ash, worn with age.
	You watch wide-eyed and not a little aroused, and finally Emet-Selch breaks their desperate kiss to let out a soft moan, his breath coming in little pants, although you know by the black Ascian robes he now wears that he has no mortal host to inhabit, and no need for air.
	Emet was right, as he always seemed to be.
	Sure, Ryne didn’t want to kill Hades, but the others?
	He was still an adult of course, one older than herself, Hythlodaeus, and even Hades by a small margin.
	Why Emet-Selch came along with us was a mystery to us all.
	“The issue here, Emet-Selch, is thou didst not make thy true intentions clear to her.
	Affecting a languid air, Emet-Selch ran his hands over G'raha's chest before working to unhook the clasps and closures of his robes, breaking or tearing what would not open easily as piece by piece he disrobed him.
	Hades tensed at the contact, “Must you always laugh at my expense?”  Hades felt his cheeks gain heat, he knew what he was referring to.
	“It’s fine,” Hades interjected, fearful he’d offended her, “I…I think it’s fine.”  “Oh?” Hades continued forward.
	G'raha did not know how long Emet-Selch held him against that edge.
	Emet-Selch.
	A few nights later, I found myself sitting in a reserved box at the theatre Hades had built in Solus’ youth.
	That was his reasons for building the foundation; but as Emet-Selch sketched and sculpted and crafted and finessed, he found himself unwittingly mesmerized by the ongoings of the sea creatures beneath the surface.
	Hades slipped your hair over one shoulder and hummed as his fingers touched your throat.
	The brutish Hyur is crude, as always, but Emet-Selch will not be goaded into an argument.
	While Hythlodaeus had been on her mind, it as Emet-Selch who was skulking along towards them.
	While Hythlodaeus had made an effort to create a jovial atmosphere, Emet-Selch seemed like a curmudgeon from the moment he had approached them.
	“Titanomachy,” Hades confirmed tightly, standing just slightly in front of Hythlodaeus as he stared hard into the swirling smoke.
	Emet-Selch was going to extract his pound of flesh, slowly,  thoroughly.
	A smile tugged on her lips as she managed to shuffle over to the sink to wash the kettle all while Hades continued to hug her.
	“Although I don’t believe there is any intrinsic harm in regaining such memories, it still remains to be seen what Emet-Selch’s motive truly is for wishing such a thing.” “We can all agree then that our friend can regain these memories if she wishes, but to continue to be wary of Emet-Selch.
	To have Hades by my side again and not worry about the Ascian threat for another minute is all I could ever dream of… But,” Aestelle paused as she lifted her head and looked to her ghostly companion, “that’s not very heroic of me, is it?
	Reluctantly, and irritated, Emet-Selch leaned over and squinted.
	Emet-Selch is beside him instantly, supporting him with his hands on Elidibus’s shoulders, murmuring soft words of encouragement.
	Hades and Sadayo deal with Zenos's response.
	“Emet-Selch, wait a moment please!” Elidibus called, halting him in this tracks.
	Hades is at least around again to help her where he can, though he alone can’t replace the twelve others they’re yet missing.
	Didn’t Emet-Selch already act in your presence?
	Well, if he was going to be up and awake, he might as well spend his time annoying Hades and Hythlodaeus.
	There’s a warning in Emet-Selch’s eyes as he gazes at the figure behind you, but by then it’s too late.
	Instead, the Exarch found himself staring at the details of Emet’s coat, the leather worn from years of use.
	Zodiark was probably dancing a jig right now at the thought of Prometheus slinking back willingly into His hands, and was dangling Emet-Selch in front of him as a carrot.
	“You could do so much more than watch, you know?” she adds invitingly, and Emet-Selch licks his lips again as his eyes spark with amusement.
	Or, well, he would, if Hades stopped  looming  threateningly over him.
	Emet-Selch was sitting up now, a steaming bowl in one hand.
	Tendrils began to coil tighter around Hades probing his body.
	Would Hades be a better reflection of himself?
	With a sigh of frustration, Hades gazes down the street, eyes scanning over all the different hues and tints of the souls going about their daily lives.
	Emet's eyes slide to Hythlodaeus and he nods.
	Hades swallowed, taking in the grey and white that colored the ends of her hair with a sudden catch of interest, “…How old are you, hero?” One of her gloved hands picked at the fabric of her coat-sleeve as she spoke, “I-I am well past my twenties thank you,” She murmured, then again with more strength, “I-I will say, I’m not sure what customs you had in Garlemald, Emet-Selch, but where I’m from, ‘tis rude to ask a woman her age.” Hades chuckled.
	Their hands gripped Hades by the hips, nails biting into his flesh.
	It seems like he won’t, as Emet-Selch gives her one last long look before turning around in silence, slowly walking away.
	“The Warrior of Light does not deserve to hear  her  song,” Hades bit out the words bitterly.
	And to her surprise, Emet-Selch is vaguely accommodating of her more erratic schedule.
	“Ah,” Emet-Selch’s eyes  lit up, “I see.” Aza froze, realising what had happened, but Emet-Selch didn’t push it beyond that.
	Emet-Selch actually had a number of plants throughout the apartment.
	“And I’m sorry to you most of all, my beloved Hades.
	Hades stood right in front of her, peering around the tree to look on at the general and the others surrounding him.
	When I woke in the morning, Hades was already gone.
	“For now, let me push back the light for as much as I am able to,” Emet-Selch murmurs as he draws her into his arms.
	Hades turned to search the bodies, but [FN] said, "Here."
	Hades could feel his friend's agitation spike, see his gaze grow distant as his soul simply… locked up.
	When Prometheus’s final moments came, Emet-Selch’s love was briefly stronger than Zodiark’s grip.
	Perhaps Emet-Selch should make certain the gunbreaker always had a bottle on hand, if it made him so disposed.
	“H-Hades,” you cry, moaning as he groans against your sex, his lips glistening from his own efforts and your fluids.
	Upon hearing that Hades had conjured up a flying lightning equine, the traveler immediately wanted to ride it.
	“It seemed like a place I would be?” Emet-Selch furrows his brow.
	“As you know, Emet-Selch is my title—Solus is the name this body wears,” he intones, coming to stand before you.
	Hades stood up with a bit more grace, “I’m guessing the MED is waiting to crystallise this?” “That’s why I was sent here: to crowbar you out,” Hades said dryly, “They’re impatiently waiting outside.” Hades looked at him, pointedly, before reaching out to grasp his hand.
	Emet-Selch runs his tongue along the underside of the Exarch’s shaft, thriving on the way it makes him shiver.
	Barely able to speak of Hades ends there wasn’t a possible way that she could tell him of what exactly happened.
	Hades was immensely skilled at art, and she felt something… strange, at the thought that he had chosen to draw her, of anything.
	But Emet-Selch is bitter.
	Hades stirred his aether into readiness, his mind flitting through his repertoire of combat-spells.
	When it takes her a moment, Emet-Selch’s eyebrows rise up, and he gives her a curious look.
	Also can someone explain to me why I'm unlucky enough to get only Hades and Elidibus' trials when I queue for my trial roulette this past week?
	They knew—they would always know—when Hades declared an argument over.
	And you’ll have to correct me if I’m wrong, Emet-Selch, as I don’t possess your sight.
	“Please, Hades...” Hades studies your lips as the words rush out unbidden.
	Though he did bother sparing Hades a parting glare, one to which the Ascian simply smirked even larger at in response.
	"Hythlodaeus, Emet-Selch!” Hades's and Hythlodeaus's eyes fell from Venat's to the warriors.
	At my request, Emet-Selch snapped, bringing us in front of a familiar building.
	She is still lost with simply feeling when Emet-Selch speeds up a bit, and she feels his release inside her accompanied by a moan and soft kisses along her back.
	Emet-Selch, meanwhile, seems to be almost amused by the sudden uproar.
	Hades woke to find a sheet pulled over him, and (Y/N) seated on the side of the bed, wrapped in a robe of silk and lace, her shoulders shaking.
	Prometheus gasped, pushing himself onto his toes, hips jerkily meeting the aggravatingly slow rhythm Hades was setting as he dug his fingers right into his friend’s shoulders, pink lines drawn from his nails… It had felt great when he masturbated, yes, but with Hades?
	A very strange name, properly stranger than Emet Selch for sure.
	"Look at that," comes Emet-Selch's now thunderous voice.
	But I have the strangest feeling you’d rather the esteemed Emet-Selch be your guide.” Emet-Selch carries a lot of responsibility, which he takes seriously.
	“Repaired what I could manage, yes.” Hades rescinded, “I’ve not the power to mend you as you are, hero, not as I am now.” Hades watched as the hero spun, swinging her cleaver across, down, then forward through the rugged mannequin’s chest.
	I turned to Emet-Selch, who stood at the back of the room with his arms crossed, watching me closely.
	Emet-Selch debated with himself about returning to them, but the discussion from earlier about sleeping with Lahabrea propelled him forward into them, enveloping them and holding them close.
	His soul still prickled, it felt like Hades was stroking an agitated cat, its back still arched, fur fluffed, but slowly, slowly,  slowly , Prometheus began to relax, the turmoil in him easing until his unsteady, short breathing slowed into the gentle evenness of sleep.
	“I don’t recall submitting to you, at all, Hades.” She was trying to sound hard, but her voice shook, and he chuckled darkly.
	He was shamefully, agonizingly hard, awareness drawn irresistibly to the caress and ripples of Emet-Selch's flesh moving against his and how good it felt.
	What was Emet doing here, visiting with D’ve?
	Not that he can blame him, there is a part of himself Emet-Selch finds wanting to see how quickly she will obey when commanded and just how far beyond the horizon her boundaries lie.
	With narrowed eyes, Hades returned his gaze to the other man.
	Emet-Selch's hands, still gripping your arms like they're a lifeline to him, tremble as he leans closer to you.
	Gaia looked up from her plate as we entered and nodded towards Hades.
	“Sorry?” Hades asked.
	"Those wicks," remarked Emet-Selch idly, still watching the glass, "are too short."
	“I will join you soon,” Emet-Selch says.
	“What did She take?” Emet-Selch asked.
	Once I absorbed it, Hades came up behind me, leaning down to grip my arm and pull me to my feet.
	“If I am appointed,” she started slowly, the apprehension in her voice immediately seizing his attention, “and I am sent off to roam the star...will you wait for me, Hades?”   “Hades, I need you—” Emet-Selch watched Vhel slowly disappear into the crowded streets outside the training complex.
	Hades supposed their first mistake had been assuming it would advance like a conventional enemy.
	With perfunctory gestures, Emet-Selch then set to disrobing himself in turn, walking in a slow little circle as he plucked every flashy accessory and over-elaborate piece of finery from his own body, finally tossing his gloves onto G'raha's chest.
	Hades grasped onto Hythlodaeus's cloak with desperation, a sob left his lips while he was wrapped up in his friends embrace.
	Hythlodaeus stood and briefly took off his mask, pressing his forehead to Hades.
	Hades face lit up immediately, and you attempted to smother the butterflies fluttering about in your stomach at his unusually pure expression.
	“This is why you can’t use it, then?” Hades interjected, more serious, “At least here?” “Emet is right,” Emilia’s face grew somewhat grim, but she nodded again.
	She can’t speak with Emet-Selch’s lips sealing hers, but the word races through her mind, expanding, and her eyes fly open wide as she finally remembers.
	Hades is not a hero.
	“I fail to see how that is any of your business,” Emet-Selch replied, moving towards his seat.
	Even without looking up she could see Emet-Selch’s face, the one he’d worn as Solus zos Galvus, manifesting within her mind’s eye and alongside him appeared the vision of Elidibus.
	Emet-Selch tenses as Adriene takes a step closer, and instinctively, Cassia shakes his grasp off as she positions herself in between them.
	Angry Hades, Aestelle now has *four* sin eater wings because fancy, and we finally get the first real introduction to those who have been watching over her from the heavens aka Halone and supposedly some of the other gods.
	“Hades.” His name was a whisper, a prayer on the man's lips.
	According to Emet-Selch, not much.
	Will they wait for Hades to wake up before casting a final judgment on his life?
	Hades knew he looked no better.
	Hades came up behind me and she smiled when she saw him.
	Hades froze and began calculating.
	“I don’t know where you found her, Emet-Selch, but I’d be careful with her.
	“And now it’s just you and me.” Emet-Selch murmurs.
	You narrow your eyes at Emet-Selch, who is smiling all too innocently as he watches you wriggle in what is clearly still his grasp, though you’re unable to figure out how that is, as he’s not visibly touching you.
	Emet-Selch later outright admits the plan is to sacrifice the people living on the Source – WHOLE, UNSUNDERED people – to Zodiark in order to get their original sacrifices back.
	Hades watched on between them, calculating, but when Urianger spoke again, he seemed reproachful, quiet.
	Emet-Selch lets out a dark laugh, disdain and condescension practically dripping from his voice.
	Hades looked.
	“Who’s to say that Emet-Selch didn’t plant those memories in their minds himself?
	It felt as though hours passed by of Hades walking around through the ruins with her silently following by his side.
	Emet hums, hands trailing down to knead at your rear.
	Emet-Selch says as he gleefully licks his lips.
	He moans, unbroken and needy, crying out into Emet-Selch’s mouth, and the Ascian presses one hand to his chest to shove him back in his chair, his back thudding against the wood and his entire body drawn upward towards the kiss as if by a string.
	“That’s all?” Hades drawls when Raha shoves himself in to the hilt, tossing his  head back with a deranged glee.
	You feel like squirming and you know Hyth can see it, as well as Hades can feel it.
	When he withdrew, he raised a brow as Azem rolled Hades off them.
	“Good.” Hades scoffed.
	It caught Hades off-guard, like a sudden warmth in a dark room, and for a split moment he felt the need to look away.
	She seems to have no answer, but Emet-Selch does.
	That’d be like Hades, “This is my first kiss, let me be all embarrassing.” Hades paused at that, a very odd feeling rippling through his soul.
	It is unfortunate that you have come to bear the blame but, Hades, know that I will always be on your side.” Hades leaned forward to wipe them away.
	With exaggerated care, he tilted it, and Emet-Selch watched the wax slowly bead on its edge and drip down the side, his skin tingling in anticipation before the wax ever struck him.
	Hades supposed it was supposed to be an angel, or something, but at this point was just a stumpy lump of stained marble.
	She hears Emet-Selch read about the courtesan getting on her knees for her many admirers, and her body moves as if it’s on strings, guided and held by the magic around her until she, too, is on her knees, facing him with wide eyes.
	Emet-Selch rolled his eyes as he raised his hand to snap his fingers.
	After all, despite the times I have watched you, you still are alive, are you not?” Emet stated, though he stepped away to keep his staff out of reach.
	At that, Emet-Selch moaned long and low, the sound captured by Hythlodaeus quickly claiming his mouth in a kiss.
	“Just kiss,” Prometheus confirmed softly, his gaze lingering on Hades’s mouth before he shifted against him, settling in more of a lazy sprawl than seductively pinning him down, “I’m too lazy to have sex.” “Lazy, hm?” Hades didn’t comment on the hard press he could feel against his hip, idly curling a lock of dark hair around his finger as his gaze drifted to Prometheus’s throat.
	Hades' hands slide cup her ass.
	Emet-Selch was not  blushing  at that outlandish insinuation.
	It was not a question of if Emet-Selch would hurt them, just knowing he could was enough to stay your hand.
	Despite this, Hades could feel his chest tighten happily—he could sense it, the strength that’d returned to her in turn, brightening her soul.
	Emet-Selch blinked and looked back at us as if he had just remembered we were there.
	Emet-Selch’s hand came up to wrap around his throat, gently, promising.
	“Oh shut it,” Hades huffed, but his soul was twinkling in poorly concealed amusement - and something else, deeper, hotter, fiery, “At least I didn’t overcompensate when crafting my true form.”  Hades’s aether flared, and Prometheus yelped when he felt a flood of icy cold water abruptly drop over his groin.
	Zodiark, Hades laughed internally.
	The Warrior watches with interest, her eyes fever-bright as Emet-Selch trails shivery kisses up her damp thighs.
	I pursed my lips but let Hades pull me through to the other side, wherever it was.
	Emet-Selch’s aether retreats as he closes the book and stands to put it on her bedside table.
	“It has your essence written all over it.” Emet-Selch furrowed his brow as he considered the pixie in front of him.
	“You can’t deny Hades,” Hythlodaeus said with patience.
	Hades cried out in ecstasy, body bending and shuddering against his bonds as he obeyed the command despite the tendril massaging the interior of his dick.
	The Words of Emet-Selch remind her a lot of the crystarium, and rooms within the tower in particular - like the Occular.
	“Oh, you have no idea just how much I want this,” Emet-Selch mutters before he does it again, and Cassia bucks her hips once more.
	“That we do.” Urianger agreed, staring at Hades with clear skepticism.
	The colors blur, shatter, coalesce; you see Hades before you—as he was—the eyes are still the same, golden but there is a brightness to them, his hair the color of the stars themselves— You cannot feign impudence here, not in this blending of the minds—it is not so much a mingling as it is a taking, utterly enfolded in the gaping maw that is Hades, a mere echo of a spark within the cosmos.
	Not many seemed to notice that she was there, even with her arm tucked between Emet’s.
	It was during this time of the umbral era when their work had brought the star five times rejoined, that Emet-Selch had receded ever so much within himself.
	Hades settled then, stretching his ankles and hands, allowing them to loosen before returning the pairs to cross at his feet and his wrists, the latter supporting the back of his head.
	The surge of power always left him feeling a bit drunk, when Hades pulled on this form.
	Well now, isn't she just like his most beloved Emet-Selch in that way?
	“Well then, seeing as I have nothing to do and the Scions are still recovering, do you want to make it a day of recovering memories?” I posited cheerfully as I turned to Emet-Selch, trying to make up for his utter lack of it.
	Emet refused.
	"I told you that back then when we met, both of us were getting ready to graduate on top of our peers, so we spent most of our time in the Capitol library…" and then he looks at Emet-Selch with a mischievous glint in his violet eyes.
	Not even for Hades.
	“Emet-Selch,” she started again, though her tone was nervous, unsure.
	“Is it?” Hades checked his internal clock, alarmed to find that, yes, he had been sat at that desk for almost twelve hours.
	“Oh, Hades~” Hythlodaeus grasped ahold of his rib, breathing hard.
	Emet turns, walking into the portal, almost through before you lunge after him from your place on the ground.
	Emet had so graciously magicked the chair mere ilms from them to under his backside, which he so elegantly now slouched in.
	Hades had nothing to say to that.
	Emet-Selch asks with an infuriatingly calm look before he leans over you and cups your cheek in a gentle hand.
	“Come now, Hades.
	Emet-Selch mused this as he held his prize tightly to his chest, cradled the Exarch in his arms as he walked through the façade of Amarout.
	“Get a cloth and follow my instructions, Hades.” “Hades, start with their face.
	I am an observer─nothing more.” Hades responded with an awkward smile.
	Hades concentrated upon his soul, his core.
	“Idiot,” Hades muttered with a sigh, “Why are you sleeping outside?
	He can’t face the fact that when Emet-Selch—Hades, he bids him—kisses him, he returns it with an ardor he did not know he possessed.
	Hades lifts the hand he is holding, thumb brushing across your knuckles in a gesture that makes your eyes burn.
	“Ah, good morning, Emet-Selch.” “Hm,” Hades stood and walked over to the boy, looking down at the plate as he approached.
	I looked up at Hades, quickly, to find him watching me as the other Ascian disappeared on the wind in dark particles.
	Hades rushed towards Persephone, a wide grin on his mouth.
	"Gods, Hades.” Altruoix’s cheeks dust pink as he looks down, shyly.
	“I deemed it impossible once,” Emet-Selch murmurs, and he holds her close enough that she can feel his warm breath on her skin.
	Quick as levin, he feels the wave of Emet-Selch's aether surround him instantly in a shield.
	With a content sigh, I leaned my back against Hades’ chest as I lazily ran the tips of my fingers through the water, creating small ripples around us.
	Hades makes a face behind his mask.
	The smallest part of Hades’ aether that resides deep within her soul goes still with a vague sense of despair.
	"I…" Emet-Selch swallowed and looked away.
	In my time using Creation magic in the real world, I found snapping my fingers did not work for me as it did Emet-Selch.
	“You’re not even trying to be subtle,” Hades accused.
	That Emet-Selch is a depraved hedonist too busy lounging in his own release to attend the duties of his station, you think but don’t say.
	"Emet-Selch?"
	“Who would have thought?” Hyth says, and you’re sure he’s winking under the mask, “Our own Emet-Selch, a depraved lecher in the sheets.
	With that, Hades quietly melted into the background.
	Hades squeezed my hand and spun me back to face him.
	Hades stopped his conversation when he heard my song, surprise and confusion flitting down the bond, but I ignored the questions his mind sent to me.
	“Ah, who has come to steal our sunlight than our dear Emet-Selch!” Azem greeted, blithely feeding another grape to Hythlodaeus who hummed in response.
	The Exarch did not show restraint now, fucking his mouth until Emet-Selch began gagging in earnest more than once, the wet choking noises barely muffled.
	Breaking Bread ='s Peace but Hades is like the God of the Underworld...so...I felt it ironic.
	“If you’d known better, you would have realized I was avoiding you,” Hades rejoined.
	“As the new Emet-Selch, I must dedicate myself wholly to the people.
	They held it up to Emet-Selch.
	(and you'll all be happy to know Emet's in it ayyeeeee) The Exarch would speak with them all in the Ocular prior to their departure for Amh Araeng and Hades is determined to make everyone hate him, much to Aestelle's dismay.
	Yes,  Hades said excitedly, his thoughts filled with happiness.
	“Find this rather amusing do we?” Hades questioned, his voice rather annoyed.
	This was the  only  time Prometheus truly let down his guard, and Hades couldn’t help but reach out to tuck a wayward, dark lock of hair behind Prometheus’s ear, his thumb brushing over his cheek.
	The Exarch looks up to say something, but before he can even speak, Emet-Selch has straddled his lap, taken the Exarch’s face in his hands, and kissed him.
	Emet didn’t seem to remember much of the time before their partnership, he and the Scions, but his ignorance was easily feigned—D’ve believed.
	“Another inquiry,” Emet-Selch says, “I didn’t want to bring it up during class, because it’s a little in depth for an introductory lecture, and I don’t plan on delving any deeper into the subject.
	Hades casts his eyes downward and Hythlodaeus instantly feels a little guilty.
	The Ascian could sense his swell of aether, the Allagan magicks heaving from his soul into the air, “I cannot well leave matters half finished.” Emet’s eyes narrowed, “Let expanse contract, eon become instant.” Emet-Selch felt the rage return, pooling into his chest, his aether.
	“What are you doing here, Emet?
	“Lift up your hips for me, love?” he asks, and Elidibus obliges, allowing Emet-Selch to prop the pillow underneath, easing him into a comfortable position before dipping his head to take Elidibus’s still flushed and leaking cock into his mouth, deeper and deeper until he reaches the base, his pale throat rippling as he swallows around the shaft.
	Then, there’s the telltale drone of a portal, and both Hades and Themis are gone.
	It hadn’t been Emet-Selch coming in.
	Hades retreats to his private office as quickly as he can.
	Hades stared at him, then turned his gaze in the same direction.
	“Emet-Selch?” Instinct carried her feet to where he waited, long before she caught sight of him.
	Indeed… With Azem often being the subject of his and Hades’s combined attentions, and rarely ever with the opportunity to top either one… Yes, they were the perfect choice.
	Hyth shook his head, chuckling, “You’re trying too hard, Hades.
	For half-a-heartbeat, Hades hated his unborn child.
	Emet-Selch shudders even at the thought, at an unbearable loss his conscious mind yet cannot bring itself to deny.
	Emet-Selch had known the desires of mortals before.
	No…” Hades said from where he towers over her at the edge of this still standing building among the fallen.
	He felt Zodiark might’ve spooked him by accident, reaching out too heavy-handedly, yes, no, Hades will ensure Prometheus was sufficiently calm before accepting His wisdom.
	I noticed the edges of Emet-Selch’s coat and pants were covered in snow, signaling that he had been made to walk even before reaching me, and realized that must have also been part of why he’d been so on edge.
	“Oh ho, that would have been an ignoble end to the Warrior of Darkness,” Emet-Selch leered when Aza  just  about avoided a very messy death via falling into the gaping, bottomless canyon below, “A clumsy  slip.” It was strange, but it was hard keeping his guard up around Emet-Selch sometimes.
	From behind, Hades' frustration is easily and blessedly silenced by Hythlodaeus; Hades, above all, knows the value of having time for yourself.
	Geeze, Hades sure fell asleep fast, huh?
	Had he been by himself, he might’ve tried to match Xeroran fashion, but instead he tried to keep to Hades’s more conservative style of dress.
	So, perhaps against his better judgement, Hades went to investigate.
	Hades was worried."
	(Emet-Selch/Azem) When a worried Emet-Selch finds out that it's because they've fallen ill, he takes it upon himself to take care of Azem, needing to be at their side.
	Her head leans further into Emet-Selch's palm as he continues to wipe the tears from her eyes.
	Emet’s hands.
	He probably thought Hades had been reaching out to hurt him.
	“So,” Hades began idly, “How’s that dissertation coming along?” “That bad, huh?” Hades tutted in mock-sympathy, setting the drink down and shoving it over into Lahabrea’s open, grasping hand, “Oh!
	Clearly, the man's presence was absolutely the problem to begin with, as even in his absence the smell of lilacs persists, every bit as strongly as if Emet-Selch had pressed his nose to Hythlodaeus's nape and inhaled his scent from there.
	Despite being a lazy man who shirked manual labour whenever he could, Hades was still very strong, so it was with a thrilling ease that he picked Prometheus up by gripping under his thighs, hauling him up (and feeling the sticky, wet feeling of his own release on his thigh which was- well, Prometheus wondered if it was weird he found that arousing).
	“But we do.” Hades said, the darkness slowly shrinking back to reveal the amethyst crystalline flooring once more, a phantom shade of Nabriales standing on the opposite side of the circular platform in front of her.
	Just before Emet-Selch was about to take his rest and depart into the darkness.
	Hades just wants to make you feel better.
	On the eve of the event, Emet-Selch visited again.
	Behind them, Emet-Selch cleared his throat.
	Emet did not leave his piece hanging off like hers, instead, he ended it with obvious improvisation.
	“So all that’s left is for me to shift this aether into Darkness and then reintroduce it to Emet, right?” She asked, looking to Beq Lugg for confirmation.
	“It’s just, well when you really think about it, Emet is immortal and so was I once.
	Tears fall from your eyes as you meet the cool, smug gaze of Emet-Selch, the Exarch having been whisked away to Hydaelyn knows where.
	“Hades!” They exclaimed, the flush on their skin deepening.
	“The perfect couple.” Hades responded with a laugh.
	“Not a bad memory…” Aestelle whispered softly, pulling the cocoa powder jar to her and then reaching over to the nearby kettle, Hades making himself comfortable and wrapping his arms now around her stomach to keep her in place.
	When Fandaniel’s hand rose, it was not unexpected, but felt like a headfirst plunge into an icy lake, as Emet-Selch was faced with the possibility that this could be it.
	“Hades, please,” she whispered.
	If you run off, she’ll be looking for any sign of Ascian activity, which will lead her straight to me.” Hades was always easy to manipulate where (Y/N) was concerned.
	At this point, Hades felt he had two options, the latter of said two was one which he’d recalled acting through with Azem and a set of grapes.
	“Yes?” Hades prompted mildly.
	The loose cloth fell forgotten to the floor, and Azem stepped on it and kissed Emet-Selch again.
	Hades waved his hand, ordering my friends to head for the entrance.
	Hades cursed when he almost lost balance, “Come to gawk then.”  “Admire, more like,” Hades corrected, coming closer.
	Hades was, however, still too embarrassed and stunned to reply.
	It is a brave question to ask, one not voiced lightly, and Hades hesitates before answering.
	Emet-Selch takes a step towards you, and you are almost relieved at the sight.
	“How surprising to see them reduced to such a state…” Hades murmured, his gaze trained on the squirming Azem, his cock twitching in anticipation as he studied their flushed form.
	He still wasn’t seeing her as Azem, as one of their colleagues potentially returned to them, and Emet-Selch himself was not sure why he was still giving him so many chances to do so.
	So she’s not inclined to stop, but there’s something about Emet-Selch treating her gently she’s not alright with– at least that’s about what he can glean from it.
	Hades just grunted, slowly lowering himself onto the floor until he was sprawled out on his back.
	It's a quick shift, Azem pulls out and then a second later the magic does its work and Emet-Selch, and he's sitting back and tugging Emet-Selch into his lap, back to chest, to press right back into his arse before he even really has chance to miss it, fingers finding his clit and working it to make him squirm.
	“So you were, what?” Hades asked, huffing a humorless laugh.
	Hades took the infant, too absorbed in his thoughts to see the way Elidibus watched him as he turned to the vanity, and visibly relaxed, his Ascian’s mark appearing, at long last, before his face.
	Hades tilted his head, looked at Prometheus from beneath his eyelashes.
	Hades will chase your soul until the ends of the earth and far beyond.
	“I have to bring Hades and Hythlodaeus next time,” Prometheus mumbled to themselves, under their breath, “They’d love this…”  “Next time,” Prometheus said as they took his hand, skipping as they moved on, “Can I bring Hades and Hythlodaeus?” We need to return home before Hades and Hythlodaeus get it in their heads to mount a ‘rescue party’ for you.”  Hades couldn’t help but glance over every so often at where Prometheus was slouched over in his seat.
	He sits upright on Hades’s couch, staring forward as though made of stone.
	“Tataru, may I introduce to you Emet-Selch, an Ascian who is also the founder of the Garlean Empire, Solus zos Galvus.”  “You’ll find I put a lot of thought into many things that could impact that Warrior of Light and her wellbeing, Emet-Selch,” he said with conviction and I looked at him once more with a raised brow.
	Hades carefully controlled them with both hands despite how desperately he wished to reach down to his own drooling cock.
	Prometheus felt Hades pull away, and he panicked, gripping at his wrist blindly.
	“‘Shoebill’?” Hades tilted his head, taking in its beak.
	Once in a while, instead of accepting, Emet-Selch bids you stop, commands you step back.
	My backside was still flush against Emet-Selch’s body, his arm still wound tightly around my waist, hugging me to him.
	“C’mon, Hades,” he crooned, letting his soul gently brush up against his friend’s, “I just want to spend some time with you.” “You  always  spend time with me,” Hades said, his lazy slouch shifting into more of a confident sprawl, poorly hiding his smirk behind his gloved fingers, “Needy little thing that you are.” “Well, I’ll be  needy  in a different way if you indulge me,” Prometheus said shamelessly, biting back a laugh when he  felt  Hades’s attention  focus  on him, a pleasant, prickling warmth tapping up his spine when Hades pressed firmly against his soul’s borders.
	“Of course she did,” Emet-Selch huffs, almost too quiet to hear.
	Once upon a time, this chamber probably looked grand, Hades mused idly as Prometheus began to settle into a near meditative state.
	Why is this the price everyone must pay for her selfish wish to save Hades being granted?
	At the losses she still had to face, the hardships her friends were forced to endure, and that damn self righteous look on Emet-Selch’s face as he made it worse.
	But the more I thought, the more I realized  everything  he said was true, even about Hades loving me.
	Oft were your own clothes the first casualty of your lust; Emet-Selch seemed to prefer to make you work to undress him, if he allowed it.
	“So, Emet-Selch was a worry-wart when it came to his friends,” I mused.
	(Y/N) joins Emet-Selch for dinner.
	You blinked owlishly a couple of times until Hades raised a brow.
	Alisaie moved to stand at Aestelle’s side, looking on at Hades with a determined flame flickering behind her eyes.
	I turned away as Hythlodaeus wrapped his arms around Emet-Selch, clenching my jaw as I struggled to keep from breaking down with him.
	I have seen enough of our family die, so, please don’t make me kill him Hades…"  Hades stops walking down the halls of the Bureau of the Architect and promptly whips around to glare at the white-robed man following after him from behind his blood red mask.
	The Exarch fell to the ground as all eyes were now on Emet-Selch.
	“I may be just a shade of myself, but no matter the form I take, I will forever remain your friend, Hades.” It told him, and despite the distortion in the voice that being a shade brought, it was still undeniably his.
	Emet-Selch cracked an eye open at the sound of my approach, but closed it again.
	“Are you interested?” Hades purred, and with how his fingers drew little shapes just above his tailbone that was - it took  a lot of effort for Prometheus to remember what the hell he was talking about.
	The Exarch looked into his cup as Emet drank his.
	I had faith in your kind once, genuinely considered leaving you to your own devices only to find your lot is never satisfied.” Hades sighed.
	Hades saw, as the silence stretched between them, Prometheus’s savage expression of fury twist into one of unsettled confusion.
	Hythlodaeus chuckles as Emet-Selch rolls his eyes.
	Emet-Selch – no, Hades – has chased you.
	“I didn’t think it difficult to guess what Emet-Selch had in mind for his epic finale to our legacy.” The Speaker scoffed.
	“You know,” Hades said after a comfortable stretch of silence, “One of the newest children for this cycle has an affinity for the Lifestream.” Hades was watching him closely from the shadows of his mask, his gaze uncomfortably knowing.
	With a resigned sigh, Emet-Selch raised his hand, snapping a glass into existence and deftly catching it in the same hand he used to conjure it to begin with.
	Indeed, Hades had done better than he could hope.
	She knows you, Hades, in ways I am thankful I do not, and that invariably means she knows what you enjoy and what you dislike.
	“Oh, believe you me, Emet-Selch barely lets me do what  I  want to do.
	You feel your ankles being tugged apart by the tentacles, spreading your legs to allow Emet-Selch to clean off what little blood remains between your thighs, and his fingers gently separate your delicate folds and crevices as he washes you, no longer using the sweet soap but simply letting the water rinse you clean.
	Hades aether had engulfed them, but the Light burned harder, brighter, searing through the dark with unrelenting speed.
	Clearly they belong to Emet-Selch, as much a part of him as any other, and just as clearly, his true nature must be nothing at all alike to the mortal shape he currently wears.
	“Hades” his true name slipped out as he pulled her bra off of her and tongued one pert nipple.
	Even if you do win, Will Emet-Selch truly let you walk away?
	Hades drew a shaky breath and turned back to the bed.
	Hades’ brow furrowed and he frowned.
	Hades rocked back on his heels and tried to think.
	"And I am telling you this now," continued Emet-Selch as though G'raha had said nothing, "so you know that you have nothing to run to.
	"I am graciously helping you out, my dear, think of it as a small reward for my efforts,"  Emet-Selch's voice comes low from right next to her ear again, and despite the warmth around her, a shiver runs down her back at the thought that he wants to see her.
	Hades clenched his jaw, closing his eyes from the bright, iridescent lighting the Tower used to illuminate the halls.
	“Really couldn’t wait, hm?” Hades said, kneading the inside of his thigh.
	She wanted this to go on, and she wanted Emet to admit to the same.
	Hades hummed.
	Hades shifted in the bed behind me.
	Here,” Hades paused as he held out his hands with his palms face up, “place your hands in mine.” “Now close your eyes.” Hades instructed, waiting for her eyes to close before doing the same.
	Emet-Selch has her repeat that circle over and over until that last bit of pushing through becomes easier with every try.
	I wonder… had the connection not been interrupted, would He have re-tempered Hades as well?”  “No, Hades, you were anything but weak,” the Speaker said, a fervent conviction in his voice that pulled my gaze up to meet his.
	Hythlodaeus is right and Hades has placed his trust in her, and even in her friends.
	You pitch forward, hands resting on Emet’s shoulders as he angles his hips, throbbing member slamming deep into your core.
	A surge of lust goes through Irene at the thought of how much she had enjoyed the idea of Emet-Selch watching her back then.
	Emet-Selch grunted.
	She saw Emet’s smile soften at her quiet laughter.
	It must be Hades.
	Hades is alive and anything that comes to pose a problem for them from this point forward cannot possibly be more troublesome than the hell she and him went through to make it this far.
	“I think he’s dead,” Hades finally said.
	Irene is about to leave the cave when Emet-Selch's voice suddenly echoes through the air again.
	Memories of her love for you.” There was a softness to Elidibus' tone then, and he wondered whether that was due to the subject of which he spoke, or him merely trying to quell Emet-Selch's still-rising ire.
	“Sorry, but I have other plans,” Prometheus said, glancing over where Hades was lurking in the corner, silently watching them both.
	“His name, Hades.
	He hissed through his teeth, back arched; Emet-Selch ground against his hips experimentally, the motion reciprocated even as the man's eyes kept drifting, damn him.
	“I’m afraid, between the two of us, I have never been able to claim to be the stronger one,” Emet-Selch mutters quietly.
	Especially when Emet-Selch's fingers glide lazily through your folds again before he spreads them apart, and then he suddenly surges forward to lick a broad stripe over your exposed clit.
	Emet didn’t speak to them in this way, with mocking, melodramatic humor, yes, but not with this sudden, vehement rage, not with this weight.
	Hades lurked in the stairwell of the manor, straightening his fur-lined coat in front of a large, gilt-edge mirror.
	That is until Hades had managed to steal me away from the party and deeper into the Capitol.” Her voice grew softer, her smile faltering.
	“Hades….”  You chuckled, though it was a pathetic one, tinted with your tears, and you wrapped your arms around Hades’ midsection in a tight embrace.
	!” Hythlodaeus complained from his seat across from Hades in their library.
	“What is it, Emet-Selch?”  Chuckling, Hades stepped through his portal and disappeared into the rift with an absentminded wave of his hand over his head, leaving G’raha to grumble to himself as he once again returns to reading his tome.
	Hades trusted him to create a fourteenth using his soul as fuel for it.
	Hades paused, some unreadable emotion flicking across his expression, but he eventually did let them switch places.
	Prometheus grumbled irritably as Hades tugged at his duvet, dislodging him from his comfortable cocoon of pillows and blankets.
	Hades paid him no mind, just meandered over to the table and took up her glass of wine, taking a moment to enjoy it, along with the flavor of her lips on the rim.
	” Elidibus reached out to put his hand on Emet-Selch’s shoulder, but he shrugged it off, nearly shoving the Emissary back to the ground with the force, and summoned his staff as he floated into the air.
	I also ship the disaster thruple of Hyth/Hades/Azem.
	It's smooth in your hands – and you do notice that, down there, Emet-Selch is entirely hairless.
	It was just about as rare for Hades to humor her childlike games as it was for Elidibus.
	“I see,” says Hades.
	“I know I’m stressing how much Emet means to me, but you each mean the world and more to me as well so please, don’t do anything reckless.
	Later that day, I was sitting in my bed, trying to concentrate on a book I’d swiped from the Cabinet of Curiosity- trying to keep my mind off of Emet-Selch.
	Emet-Selch waited until the washed out, thin, faded impression of his old friend travelled too far for him to sense anymore before he got out of the tree.
	Hades hand found its way to Hythlodaeus's cheek where he wiped away the small stream of tears.
	Your legs spread more wide from under him and, with little preamble and as if your bodies had twined like such for so many times before, Hades drives his cock slow and with ease inside of you.
	Hades, we definitely met at the spring celebration,” she said quietly and I breathed a laugh, shaking my head.
	Shouldn’t she have felt some blossoming pride at the thought that Emet had asked for  her  and no one else?
	“T-That’s so  adorable,” Prometheus gasped, working his hands free of Hades’s, “Aw, I kinda want to blow raspberries on your stomach now…” Hades sighed, dramatically flopping like a limp fish, his arm dangling over the edge of the sofa as he muttered, “Mood.
	“Emet?
	So something inside both breaks and clicks into place when Hades opens his mouth, quiet and crippling to your limbs.
	Hades frowned at him.
	“Emet-Selch,” she calls through a smile.
	"They worship the very ground you walk on, Warrior of Light," Emet-Selch muses with a menacing look that turns into something thoroughly unsettling when he adds a smile to it.
	They sat in silence as Hades’ chest rose and fell, anger dripping from his visage in waves, rolling and churning beneath his skin.
	Emet-Selch's smile widens, but his eyes harden at the same time as he gives you an eerie look, and suddenly his hand is in your hair, grabbing a handful and pulling harshly until you are forced to tilt your head back as he crushes you against his chest.
	The thought raced through Hades's head and he felt his heart rate pick up.
	She’d always been willing enough to listen to his cause, when Hades had come to discuss or listen in on the Scions’ conversations, but never jovial such as this.
	It was quickly followed up by Hades’s smoothing a hand over his hair, his fingers catching on Prometheus’s tangled, messy hair, tugging the worst of the knots out.
	“H-Hades,” his wheezing friend gasped, “I want t-to help-” !” Hades snapped, cold fear washing through him at the thought of Hythlodaeus getting caught in a very messy crossfire, “Go!
	I understand why you did it, I honestly do...but I think right now actions will truly speak louder than words and if you want to make things right, then I ask you help me save Emet and Elidibus.” Aestelle said softly.
	Hades chuckled, making sure to look her in the eye, before taking the tomato and plopping it into his mouth, whole.
	Azem pounded into Hades with abandon they scarcely ever allowed themselves, reaching as deep into him as they could, grinding their hips against his round ass, and basking in his oh-so-encouraging sounds of pleasure.
	“I know, Hades.” “Home, Hades.” Hinted Hyth/WoL/Emet triangulations going on, but Emet and WoL are in a committed relationship.
	Those mesmerizing, golden wells of his met Hythlodaeus’ eyes in silent commands exchanged between them, their minds and desires as one before Emet-Selch raised his hand and let the first smack fall on that supple, curvaceous flesh that had been beckoning him this entire time.
	Hades begins to follow up, turning so he can face you and be in Lahabrea’s line of vision at once, but you suddenly slide yourself onto the desk, closing enough distance to shove your hand straight into his mouth and muffle his words.
	Hades pulls his tongue flat over the fabric, dragging it from the drenched area at your center and spanning upward to the budding of nerves swollen from neglect.
	The lighting was ethereal for one thing, but towering over it was Professor Emet-Selch.
	These were the first moments of the Unsundered before they had any idea what had truly happened, Lahabrea and Hades obviously in disbelief and shock as they quietly walk side by side and further away into the distance.
	Tingling in that unique way only Hades’s soul did, warm and soothing, muffling the grinding roar of hundreds of souls into a tolerable, distant mumble.
	Though she had been assured it had just been reverted to its natural aether, and Emet-Selch could call upon it at a moment’s notice, it still rubbed her the wrong way.
	There was never anyone else for her other than Hades.
	I was back to where the final confrontation with Emet-Selch happened, on my hands and knees as I grasped at my chest and continued to gulp in the air around me, overwhelmed.
	“Emet-Selch and I. Hades felt his heart stop, shuddering—surely…surely he was mistaken.
	The atmosphere almost seems to darken and you cannot figure out for the life of you why, when it’s just you and Hades.
	Emet-Selch had tuned out somewhere around the statistical likelihood of the onset of estrous becoming more likely with each passing year after sexual maturity, an indefinite cycle infuriating with its seeming randomness, the length of which apparently changing from person to person.
	It doesn’t take long, Emet biting your shoulder, shuddering silently as he goes over the edge, orgasming in silence as you come moments later.
	Hades eyes dance with delight.
	Emet-Selch lifts Elidibus up into his arms, careful not to jostle him too harshly as he turns.
	“I did not mean to offend you, hero,” Before he could stop himself, Hades lowered one of the bags from his shoulder and placed it on the ground.
	There is no way someone as closed off as Emet-Selch would do all that if he had zero faith in her to begin with.
	“Aaaaaah, perhaps,” You drawl, running your hands up his sides, “But if you recall, Emet-Selch…” Emet-Selch doesn’t understand.
	“Don’t antagonize them,” I hissed at Emet-Selch, and he only shrugged at me, his face a woeful grimace as if his mother had just scolded him.
	Emet-Selch frowns.
	“Forbidden from looking around, am I?” Hades mocked, glancing around for effect.
	“You followed through with your heroic Lightwarden slaying so I felt it only prudent I check in on my precious hero.” Hades murmured.
	“Hey, Hades?” Prometheus said as his eyes slipped closed, “You going to sleep there?” “Uh uh,” Prometheus sounded amused, his soul fluttering with it, and Hades heard the soft tap of him setting his Rubix cube on the coffee table, “I can tell.
	Also, if you guys are on the search for a wonderful, inclusive, and supportive Emet/FFXIV fanfic community, I urge you to come by and join this discord!
	“Please.” Hades whispers in the tiniest of voices, muffled into Hythlodaeus’s neck, half wishing his lovers won’t hear it- but they do.
	I hadn’t realized how close I’d walked to the painting in my observation of it, until my fingers were gently tracing the dried brushstrokes of her face, and I felt Emet-Selch walk up behind me, remaining silent as he also examined the portrait.
	Still set upon the bed, you startled a moment and considered your options: you were far too groggy to properly fight Hades’ monstrous form off; if you chose to run or return via a spell he would most certainly catch you.
	“Some are bioluminescent worms,” Emet says, stepping behind you.
	Merely hauls himself up by the folds in Hades's robes to gasp greedily against a mouth half through its diatribe.
	Why Hades thought he needed it was anyone’s guess – he’d certainly never had any trouble getting himself ready before.
	Hades felt his expression placate.
	Prometheus’s happiness almost blindsided him, it erupted so suddenly and so  purely , heavy with warm affection and love, that Hades almost shied away from it.
	"You've been miserable all night, and yet I've not heard you say that one specific word that would stop all this," Emet-Selch muses as he watches your every move with hunger in his eyes.
	“Of her creation…?” Hades draws it out, uncertain, as your lips still over his cockhead.
	Besides, I am the wife of Hades, the Amaurotine, the Ascian, the Architect.
	Hades clenched his fists, sitting up in his cot with a growl of frustration.
	“Emet-Selch, are you in there?” He knocked--pounded, really--on the door.
	Hades  will have his other half back.
	One would  never forget,” Emet growls, “But prove to me that there is another with thirteen times rejoined that we might usher to our side.” Emet shrugs half-heartedly.
	Looking out into the Ocular and to the crystal mirror emanating a bright cerulean glow, Hades smiled some to himself.
	She needed them, and in a stark contrast to Emet-Selch’s ferocity, Hythlodaeus’ touch was gentle and feathery light when he reached out to cup her breasts.
	Everyone turned to look on at Hades, Thancred most of all finding annoyance with his constant presence while he scowls at the Ascian.
	“I can sense that Emet.
	Also, I loved the last few sentences with Urianger and Hades and I'm glad my sleep deprived brain pulled that out...lol.
	They were alone here, yet Emet felt the weight of a thousand lifetimes, a thousand souls peering into his very heart.
	Hades remained quiet for a moment as he looked into her eyes.
	But even though Emet-Selch had taken a price for his help from you, he had also offered you something in return, something you didn't even know you wanted.
	I know you’ll never forgive me, Hades.
	Oh, Hades remembers now, and he  knows—  knows Azem  is you, maybe you even planned this whole thing while you were still whole, with Venat no less.
	I should not have…” Hades trailed off when he realized she hadn’t pulled away, so he returned his hands to her back.
	Azem took a moment to recover, then did as Hythlodaeus asked, while the man in question began to rail Hades into the mattress, pulling desperate cries of passion from deep within his chest, his cock leaking all over the sheets.
	He had to admit that with his beloved so close to waking from her slumber, Hades was growing eager and impatient.
	“Rude, I just helped you to the sofa like you asked,” Hades crooned, confidently moving to straddle his hips.
	Crickets chirped in the distance while Hades’ face returned to its neutral albeit tired expression.
	“She’ll still be dead.” Hades tried not to think about the bitterness and pain in his voice.
	She gave the man an appreciative nod, and Hades let his eyes sweep over the curve of her jaw before she turned back to him.
	Do not take this as an incentive to overwork yourself, but… I love that about you, Hades, do you know that?” Frowning, Emet-Selch pulls a bit away, carefully reaching up to cradle your head as he removes you from the crook of his neck.
	I’m yet to discover from whence you came,” began Emet-Selch as he took a few steps toward her, “but here we don’t yell at each other from across the way.
	My vessel lives because of it, does it not?” Hades quipped, turned back to the Warrior of Light, “I do need to make contact, hero, as distasteful as it may be for you.” Hades took in a breath as he retreated back within his core, relieved by the pool of aether that rose in turn to greet him.
	Hythlodaeus silenced Hades with a deep kiss, hand loosely wrapped around his throat and pulling him back.
	Next to him, Hades was just… taking this all in stride.
	Let us talk of Emet-Selch.” The red-masked Ancient said, everyone looking to her beloved.
	“Hades,” she repeated, dazed.
	Maybe he'll have Hades grant him claws, just for a little while, so he might leave additional traces of their encounter behind.
	He's quick and attentive, always, coming to Emet-Selch's side to push his sweat damp hair out of his face and kiss his jaw, his ear in gentle greeting.
	Hades's alarm began to edge into near-panic.
	“I asked you a question, Hades.” Hades is a prideful man.
	Hades gave him a heavy-lidded look, letting out a quiet, fond noise.
	She can still hear Hades's desperate pleading as she turned her back on him.
	This is an Emet-Selch she’s familiar with Thank you for all your help, oh eminent Emet-Selch, but I’ll find my answers on my own, just like you wanted.
	“No it was, truly.” Aeliana sidled over to Emet-Selch—exuding more confidence than she actually felt—and held his stare when she peered up at him from beneath her lashes.
	The Warrior of Light looked back at me then, taking a deep breath before she continued, “Do you have any idea how hurt she was, realizing that you lied to her, Hades?” The past doesn’t matter anymore, Hades.
	Hades looked around for effect, gesturing, “I see all of your companions are here.” “Interesting.” Hades hummed, “Considering how she’d reacted to the prospect of those two leaving before.” “How long?” Hades almost flinched at how desperate his voice sounded.
	To spite the man with a feral grin on his face driving into her body, Hades ensures he swallows the sound as she comes undone on Hythlodaeus' cock.
	Our story.” Hades confirmed with a troubled expression, flicking his eyes between her friends before settling on her yet again.
	“ Nh, H-Hades, this is…” Prometheus gasped, barely managing to keep a straight thought.
	Where she had just tried to push Emet-Selch away, she now grabs his coat almost in a panic, holding on with all her might as she tries not to go mad from the sensation of flying and falling at the same time.
	“Good guess,” Emet-Selch smiled.
	Experimentally, gently, he squeezed, and the Exarch's hands flew up -- not, to Emet-Selch's surprise, to pry that invasive hand away, but to grasp onto the one encircling his shoulders in a bruising grip.
	Not like any she's seen before, but that  scent  --it's undeniably  Hades  .
	Emet-Selch in the Lifestream?
	Wordlessly, the Exarch sank to his knees, seizing Emet-Selch by the hips and pulling him in as he took the Ascian's cock into his mouth, muffling his own whimper against his rigid flesh.
	“Oh, for the love of Zodiark,” Emet-Selch drawled, coming to a stop next to Y’shtola, who turned and took a step back, surprised by his sudden close proximity.
	What a sight that would be for one of the greatest Creators ever to have a seat on the Convocation, walking in on you with your hand halfway down Emet-Selch’s throat.
	But how will history change if she rescues Hades and it becomes known that she risked everything to save an Ascian?
	”Lady (L/N),” Hades snapped the correction before he could stop himself, then coughed.
	Whatever would I have told your precious Warrior of Light?” Emet began as he walked toward the table.
	Hades is skeptical when you first bring the idea up.
	Emet-Selch doesn’t have it in himself to blame him.
	Hades drew Azem down into a kiss, inviting in their tongue, moaning against them as the cool aetheric tendrils pulled him apart, making way for Azem’s burning hot cock.
	“Didn’t have to drop me…” he grumbled with mock-irritation, curling his fingers into Hades’s dark hair and cradling him close as his mouth trailed down to his neck, over his throat.
	“Oh, Prom…” Hades breathed, “What have you done to yourself?”  “You’re-” Hades stopped, tamping down hard on the knee-jerk habit of scolding him.
	Emet-Selch didn’t want that to happen.
	“-cerned that he had such an awful accident,” he was saying to Hades, “It’s very unusual.” “The Lifestream is unpredictable, even for Prometheus,” Hades replied, “He was just unlucky today.
	Emet-Selch was left alone, with naught but his faith in Zodiark to guide him, which he clung onto with a fierceness.
	Tugging at her hand she swallows, “Emet-Selch….” I know where it is, after all.” She really doesn’t want to wait around for the fall out, or even sit through the banter if for some wild reason Emet-Selch decides to pretend as if nothing happened.
	It was not much of a weapon per se, but in her hands, in her hands it very much could be, and here, Hades could see much of the same.
	Emet-Selch’s voice is much lower than she is used to.
	What little good will Emet-Selch might have earned from restoring Y’shtola quickly wears its welcome away.
	"You are going to hurt me," you murmur a bit dumbfounded, and at your surprised tone, Emet-Selch lets out a dark chuckle.
	Not far down the hallway was an open doorway where she could see Emet-Selch leaning up against the frame.
	I'm having a blast writing this story lul it's so much fun writing for Hades :3 can't wait till Elidibus makes his first appearances and all hell breaks loose lmaoooo Also my goal of buying the night pegasus mount is only looking more and more bleak everytime I check the market board again and find that the price is *somehow increasing* ;-; at least I have my Hades statue in my apartment to cry in front of while I watch the one mount I really want slip from my grasp xD It's because of Hades that Y'shtola is saved from the Lifestream, so why do her friends still glare at him so harshly?
	“Emet-Selch!” Hades looked up to her, “May the star guide you upon your path, my dear.” Needless to say, it was a mixture of memories, both from Hades, D've, and Emilia, mingled with the aether conjoining and well, the big realization at the end of the chapter.
	Emet-Selch grimaced, apparently realizing that speaking to his friend was a losing battle, and turned back to face me, practically shooing me away with just his expression.
	There is no reason to assume Emet-Selch would hang around the whole day, but something in her is adamant she would find him.
	Emet-Selch gave a small, barely discernible smirk.
	“The Scions and Emet-Selch are spread across the star to see if we could recruit our many friends and acquaintances for the sake of the world.” I sighed.
	Emet-Selch heard the Exarch sigh next to him, the slow and deliberate sound of a man that realized he was being provoked into an argument and, to hell with it, was going to take the bait anyway.
	Not saying a word, she could only watch as Hades’ spared her one last look before turning around, one he never spared her before.
	His concentration broken, Emet-Selch looked to Hythlodaeus with a tired expression.
	As his breathing began to stabilize, Hades could see the silhouettes of the Scions approaching him.
	Your newest Creation was nearing completion – as Hades should well know, having licked it off your fingers – and you’d consulted with several members of Anyder about a different request, a complex one submitted by some researchers who required new equipment to monitor the levels of aether in various environments.
	“Three left.” Hades raised an eyebrow at Elidibus.
	Hades was utterly speechless, he hated she had been right.
	“Emet-Selch,” she greeted him.
	Emet-Selch got the idea that Azem was expecting him to climb in next to them.
	Elidibus scowls, but he knows a lost cause when he sees one and so contents himself with watching, concern evident in his features even behind the crimson mask, as Emet-Selch takes a deep breath before clasping your hand once more.
	Hades smiled lazily, leant back a bit more into the sofa, watched as Prometheus’s gaze darted down to his exposed throat as he tilted his head back.
	Emet-Selch sighs.
	Where Emet-Selch is a man without shadow, his magic now very much looks like one.
	I have already fought my way through this hell once, and so it’s not my worth Emet is judging.
	“By the star, what has gotten into them?” Hades panted as he curled around a pillow his body aching from its heightened sensitivity.
	G'raha stood resolute, refusing to give Emet-Selch the satisfaction of his fear even as the man brought his bloodstained gloved hand up to cradle the back of G'raha's neck, thumb pressed lightly against his jugular.
	Hades opened his mouth to argue when a voice caught both of their attention.
	“You’re not worth the theater of it,” Hades snarled, and abruptly turned to (Y/N).
	Emet-Selch too glances at her spear resting against the wall.
	Hades could have easily kept her close if he truly wanted her to share the Ascian fate.
	They were just shy of kissing, and Prometheus stayed perfectly  still, lips parted slightly as he felt Hades’s soul gently unfurl and open up for him, inviting him in.
	“Where is this place, exactly?” you ask, as Emet-Selch carries you down a hallway that contains at least five different rooms, branching off into more corridors at each end with a colossal stairway leading down from the center.
	“Aside from the whispering, you seemed to function just fine while tempered before, Emet-Selch,” the male twin said with a shrug.
	The world was burning around them but it felt like Hades’ sorrow being expressed was the surest sign of the end.
	“Emet-Selch,” The Exarch began, stepping aside to allow entrance to his charge, “I’ll skip the pleasantries, if I may.” Hades chuckled, gesturing with his fingers.
	“But I must take my leave, Emet-Selch.
	Hades is always crusading for Him, insisting He can solve everything, insisting this is His will.
	Hades jumped.
	Finally, Emet spoke again, eyes boring into the Exarch’s frame.
	Malformed creatures, thrashing blindly about; the ghost of memory walks into Emet-Selch's present and haunts his every encounter.
	“E-Emet…” “Emet, I swear if you don’t go down there right now, I’m taking care of it myself.” “Emet.” “Emet!” “Emet!” You cry out in your final release.
	Raising his hand high above his head and snapping his fingers once more, Hades clothed Y’shtola and the light all around her vanished along with the image of the souls he had created for them to see.
	Hades took in a breath, sighing as he looked down at the book in his hands.
	I felt the bond open a miniscule amount, and I knew as Hades  tried  to come to my side the he had felt my agony as his own.
	"Usually not for this purpose, but it works just as well,"  Emet-Selch explains.
	Hades watched me carefully, curious, as I refused to betray my thoughts to him.
	“As you like,” He closed the door, and Hades heard a definitive click as it locked behind him.
	“How are you crossing the rift with mortals?” Hades asked, focusing on the other Ascian, who merely grinned.
	“Hello, hero.” Emet-Selch purrs, fully aware you could not mistake him for another, “Care to guess who?” “Emet-Selch!” One day you’ll say ‘Hades’, and this will all – With deliberate and careful touches Emet-Selch drafts his canvas, even for such a minor magic.
	There was a wound there, ragged and raw for all the eons Emet-Selch had borne it, and G'raha, torn between the kindness in his personality and the instincts of a predator, chose cruelty.
	“It seems we've finally found something we agree on, Elidibus: the fact that neither of us expected to see the other here.” Emet-Selch observed with a smile that was slowly becoming more genuine by the moment, taking no small pleasure in his companions’ discomposure at his arrival.
	With a shuddering sigh, Hythlodaeus pressed himself into the toy, languidly rocking his hips into it, gnawing his lower lip as he felt Hades clench around him.
	Hades’s soul prickled almost possessively, blanketing tighter around him, feeling jagged and angry.
	Emet-Selch had underestimated how cross they would feel about his partner when deceptions were revealed.
	Emet-Selch withdrew his fingers and in nightmare tones projected a vivid imperative: "Say it."
	Hades gasped as he felt his aether rebuked from within the hero, chimes and splintering brightness overpowering what little his eyes could manage to see.
	“Take it as a comfort,” Emet-Selch suggests as his lips hover directly over hers.
	Though Hades knew the little game they were playing meant she had to go with him, had to let him think he still had a chance at her heart, he still couldn’t stop the possessive anger from overwhelming him, and he’d stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind him.
	And Hades snickers at it, vibrating further against your folds when you are already so close, the wretch.
	Emet-Selch dispels the delusion, well past being haunted by ghosts residing within each fragment.
	You'd been the target of a particularly intense bout of observation once, well before Hades was granted his place as Third; with the relentless tease of lifelong friends, Hythlodaeus had answered your queries on the matter in Hades’ stead, offering only evasive compliments on your teaching style.
	“Emet is alone in his recreation of our home and Elidibus could be anywhere right about now.
	She raised a hand to wave just as Hades so regularly does while the guards opened the doors for them both.
	For Hades, Azem drew the many masks and marks of incantation that Hades knew, representing his great casting ability and mastery of the arcane, as well as many buildings and other models of architecture that Hades worked on at the Bureau before taking his new role in the Convocation.
	Hades ran a hand irritably through his hair, and examined himself in the mirror again.
	To be so close to saving Hades only to have not only Hydaelyn but her very friends turn their backs on her─she’s not even all that surprised anymore.
	“Nothing in this world means more to me than you and Emet.
	Hades could feel the colors the melody evoked of his memory.
	Eventually, Hythlodaeus withdrew from the kiss and gripped Hades’s jaw, lips curving into a mischievous smile.
	Emet-Selch shakes his head ever so slightly, but Cassia only holds on stronger.
	“Will they be okay?” Elidibus asked, echoing Emet-Selch’s own thoughts, far too preoccupied with the thought of Azem pushing themselves so hard to meet their obligations that they ended up collapsing.
	Footsteps rung out into the large space from across the platform, her attention fixed on Hades as he walked up to stand opposite of their group.
	“How sick are they?” Emet-Selch asked, cutting her off.
	Vauthry or no it didn’t change the fact that Emet did save Y’shtola, no matter their distaste, he did try to help them understand their fight, understand them, the Ascians.
	He carries on like this for a few times more until Emet-Selch is gasping like a dying man with each denied orgasm.
	“Depending entirely on brute strength like an animal always opens yourself up to these things,” Hades said idly, prying Prometheus’s hands off his wrists.
	Hades took a step forward on his platform and disappeared, then suddenly was looming over me, placing himself between me and his comrade.
	“Thank you…” Aestelle whispered barely loud enough for even her to hear, her hands pressing hard into her chest as if to hold the parts of Hades he had relinquished to her.
	Hades wonders if this is how you feel – Hades has grown tired of lying and making excuses for himself, so he finally, finally, meets your lips with his, allows himself to drown you both in mortal pleasures.
	His victory so close at hand and Hades does not falter for a moment, even as he worries over your labia with his lips.
	Hades starts, but curses as his damned  pants  restrict him from getting too far.
	Hades gripped at his chest, shaking.
	Emet finally took his hands away from the Exarch’s shoulders to hold his heart in mock pain.
	“That’s what you’ve been doing these past few days?” Hades hissed.
	Emet-Selch softens the grip on her wrists when her head droops again.
	His laughter turns into chuckles, ticklish as he is, trying and failing to squirm away from Hades’s hungry mouth, but pale arms cage him in place.
	“You can find me even when I am not at the shrine?” she asks the first thing that goes through her mind, and Emet-Selch lets out a scoff.
	However…” Her milky eyes flicked up to Emet-Selch then, and it made me wonder what she saw when she looked at him.
	For his part, he began thrusting into Hades, well aware the esteemed Convocation member could no longer focus enough to please him.
	“We should be the ones to ask you, how are you feeling?” Scooting ever nearer to sit snugly beside them, Hythlodaeus draped one arm around Emet-Selch’s shoulder while the other snaked around Aeliana’s middle.
	Hades knows who he is, and he had known when you were lost that he would have no other.
	Hades clenched his teeth as he dropped forward, bracing his fall with his outstretched hands and bent knees.
	Emet-Selch tilts his head and shrugs again, “Not particularly.
	Tensions have just been a little high since Emet showed up is all, but that’ll end soon.
	So desperately in love, and too powerful for ones so lacking in wisdom.” Hades closed his eyes for a moment, then turned to look at her.
	I mean, fucking- Hades,  I need assistance!” Hades eyed the smoke pouring out through the door with trepidation, his nose and throat already burning.
	“You’ve been here before,” Emet-Selch insists.
	You wanted me back, and I am here, Hades.” She had been so nervous to close the distance between them mere moments before, yet now that she had her memories of them as lovers returned to her, Persephone no longer had any qualms about nuzzling as close to Emet-Selch as she possibly could.
	Some added flesh to the story, written from Emet-Selch's perspective.
	“Music soothes me,” Hades said, and attempted to smile innocently.
	“Budge over,” Hades ordered, pushing Prometheus to the side, “I’m joining you.” After much pushing, elbowing, and Prometheus realising he was too weak to really put up a fight against Hades right now, they ended up lying side by side on the bed, nose to nose, Hades giving him a very thoughtful look.
	Emet sits back, hands resting on your abdomen.
	The couch is much too small for three grown men, but Hades finds it suits them well enough.
	“Ah, I…” Hades shrugged, standing back to his full height, “I simply did as the Warrior of Darkness asked, she’s the one deserving of your praise.” “Regardless,” The man reached forward and picked up a small bag from the table, reaching out and forcing it into Hades’ hands.
	Her thighs flex and tense, squeezing hard on Elidibus’ head as she comes, her moans turning into soft sobs in Emet-Selch’s mouth.
	“I’ll be seeing you around soon, Emet.” Though this time as she walked to meet back up with them, she could sense Hades’ presence more clearly.
	But in the meantime, Emet-Selch found himself wanting for company.
	“He wasn’t always like this, was he?” Hades shook his head and reached for my hand, running his thumb over the knuckles.
	“Mixing business and pleasure,” Hades laughed.
	I huffed a laugh and wiped the water from my face, then turned back to Hades my mouth tugging upward.
	Emet-Selch frowns at that, arms hanging at his sides as he shifts into his usual slouch.
	“Even now, Emet-Selch’s loyalty is astounding.
	Hades would feel them,  know  what effect he was having on him, and Prometheus wanted- he wanted him to- “Ha- ah-!” he couldn’t even get his name out- just, that raw, hot burst of  relief, hips mindlessly jerking in uneven thrusts as Hades, lovely, lovely Hades, gently stroked him through his orgasm - sticky, wet, his brain blankly noted - until Prometheus was whining from the touch, hypersensitive and squirming from it.
	Hades glares across the table at his friend.
	“Ow  …” Prometheus groaned breathlessly, squirming when Hades just  worked  at the stinging bite.
	All the better if you deem it to be official Ascian business and leave it to me.” Emet-Selch turned to walk out of the portal, giving Elidibus a lazy wave as he did so.
	Gulg and fight Innocence─and later confront Hades─and she desperately wants time to go as slowly as it possibly can.
	“It seems  I  win,” Hades hummed, gently picking Prometheus’s head up enough to rest his chin on Hades’s approximation of a lap.
	“Enough, Emet-Selch.
	“Emet-Selch, explain what’s going on,” The Exarch held his staff at the ready, moving to touch the Warrior’s shaking arm.
	When I appeared on the Ninth, though, I understood immediately why Hades had warned me about the shard.
	It pays off when Emet-Selch sounds demanding in a way that makes her throat feel dry at his next words.
	Emet-Selch merely shrugged, as if it was trivial and most understandable.
	"Daeus," Emet-Selch warns with a low voice that sends shivers down your spine, but then you feel his smile against your neck before he drops a kiss there.
	Emet-Selch rolls his eyes extravagantly, then looks at Xelinah, a hint of a smile on his face.
	“My, my, you were not fooling me,” Emet-Selch said with a snort as he approached the sleeping form of the Exarch.
	I can’t fail him, Hades.” She said as she looked up at her beloved.
	“Mm, I don’t know,” he murmured, unconsciously tilting his jaw when Hades leaned in to kiss the corner of his mouth, “I feel kind of dizzy right now... ” “From…?” Hades asked quietly, his slightly cold hand splaying flat against his stomach.
	Hades could have been here for years already or only a few hours.
	Hades paced outside to study the lightning beast again, as if that would lend it—and him—strength.
	“Don’t worry, fate has had a field day in making a mockery out of me as well so consider us one and the same despite our histories.” Aestelle reassured, already pulling Hades to turn and head for the doors to the conference room.
	As Emet-Selch, Hades, The Architect, Paragon of the Source, he had no power.
	That’s how you got here; sitting at Emet-Selch’s desk, in his office in the Capitol building, undergarments completely removed.
	Emet-Selch made his way over to the pained warrior before he formed a squat.
	Hades muttered, trying to decode the calculations.
	Hades almost forgot they were meant to be doing something else other than basking in each other until Prometheus started to jerkily, clumsily grind down against his belly.
	He cuts you off immediately; whatever nonsense you meant to spout about him going along with these debauched acts for your sake, Emet-Selch would not hear it.
	Hades’ eyes followed her own, confused; he could breathe again, but his lungs felt full of that scent, of her.
	The way Vala would cling to them while he and Hades teamed up against the pair and, at Hyperion's inevitable goading and direction, would reverse the script on  them  .
	“Oh, well, at least you set aside time for  recycling,  ” Hades muttered, aggressively swiping up on his phone, “Glad to know that’s one of your top priorities.”  Hythlodaeus and Hades both tuned him out at the exact same time.
	‘I would do anything for you, Hades’  a wistful memory of whispered affections fills his mind.
	“And those involved parties may be who, Emet-Selch?” “It’s him.” G’raha’s face stiffened, “...Emet-Selch.” Hades lulled his head back to the door, watching the flicker of the lamp upon the wall.
	And while it is clear that Emet-Selch doesn't want you permanently harmed, you know this is a test all the same.
	It would be a simple matter to recover faster and see to filling Hades further, perhaps pushing him to the point where his fullness began to show…but… If you'd love to have more stories to read, come join us at Emet-Selch's Book Club, a wonderful community of authors and readers!
	A little more forcibly than he intended, Hades pulled back and hefted the bag above his shoulder, yanking it from her hands, “I’ll manage hero, continue on.” Zodiark help him he could feel her muscles, the bend and weight of her hips, her chest stretching against his stomach, his thighs.
	Under the mute gaze of Emet-Selch, G'raha dressed himself with limbs heavy and stiff from confinement and grief.
	How does she save Hades?
	“That’s what I’ve been trying to say, but they have been arguing that the similarities do not matter in the grand scheme of things.” Cassia hurries to add her explanations about how Emet-Selch seems so adamant on the importance of fate and destiny in the work, making reconciliation impossible.
	Emet stands, removing his gloves with immaculate teeth, tossing them down on the table.
	“Yes, it’s me.” Emet-Selch nodded.
	(Prometheus was staring through him, shaking violently as Hades struggled to keep his soul together, aether spilling out like water from a sponge, uncontrolled and fatal.
	He doesn’t remember Amaurot unlike herself and Hades, but he remembers his duty, that which Zodiark has complete influence over and has twisted all in the name of some pitiful excuse for salvation.
	Emet proves his last words as much when he leads her inside their next stop.
	Emet-Selch watches as she gathers her hair, binding it slightly off center, then twisting the braid around the binding.
	Hades always indulged Prometheus in these rambles, even if he didn’t care about the subject.
	“Hmm.” Emet-Selch leans his head against the doorframe, then turns her to her.
	“No,” wilfully ignorant of Emet-Selch’s earlier warning regarding any disobedience, Aeliana cut him off.
	“...” Hades drummed his fingers on the edge of the spring, his soul feeling restless and frustrated, “They’ve been happening more often lately.” “Don’t apologise,” Hades huffed at him, “It’s something you  obviously  can’t help.
	“You could say that, yes.” Hades murmured.
	Emet-Selch’s hood is falling, revealing the streak of grey in his hair, the dark purple at his part.
	Emet-Selch had a good point about honesty: being able to laude the fact that they came forth willingly and openly was a good method of diffusing many means of interrogation.
	“And what has possessed you to give us orders this morning?” Hythlodaeus murmured by Hades’s ear, his fingers caressing over his torso.
	“Looks as though someone’s ego hasn’t quite recovered from being swatted out of the air like some fly during my battle with my dearly beloved.” Hades scoffed as he returned Thancred’s cold stare with a cocky smirk of his own.
	“Oh thank the heavens.” Hades exhaled a sigh of relief as he pulled back a little further to really look down at her.
	“I… All right,” Hades pushed the door closed, and let the darkness envelop them both, save the small sliver of light from parted curtains at the far end of the room.
	Hades drew Azem’s robe upward, but Hythlodaeus reached out to stop him, smirking.
	If I didn’t know better, I would say you didn’t like me,” Emet hummed, following him as he left the Occular, heading for the stairs out into the Crystarium proper.
	I know only what Eden told me.” Hades’ arms tightened around me and I leaned my head to the side.
	“Will you perhaps join us, tonight?” Hades looked over as the Warrior of Light began repacking his satchel.
	Casting your heavy eyes downward, they are swift to lock onto the scene below—the subtle, depraved grin Hades offers while his large hands drift up to cup and grasp over your breasts in full, watching with fixation as you throw your neck back when his thumbs  push and flick hard over pert peaks.
	And to hopefully be at peace and find it within himself to let go of his guilt and despair...just as she prays Hades has.
	Emet-Selch continued to close the distance between us as he made his painfully slow strides, finally leaving us a mere two feet apart, and I couldn’t help the way my body stiffened.
	As the girl had said, a spot where two heavy manuscripts sat had been placed carefully next to Emet’s left.
	Not here and not today—not when Aeliana already struggled so hard to keep her secrets from Hythlodaeus and Emet-Selch.
	Before she was forced to fight Hades, she took one final reading into her own fate and it was Halone who was placed upright at the top of the Dawn Cross, foretelling of her inevitable victory over the second Unsundered she would have confronted in battle.
	The Emet in the short story is shockingly clever and analytical, I like him the more I read it over again.
	The descent began in earnest after Emet-Selch had run into Azem, the other coming from who-knows-where, their arms wrapped around a basket filled with replica creatures, the likes of which could be seen all around Elpis.
	Olivier moved away, and Hades finally let himself look at (Y/N) when the door closed behind the Elezen.
	The Capitol is but a ruined set of metal framework in the distance and she can’t see Hades walking all the way there in its current state so he has to still be around here somewhere.
	“We need to retreat,” Hades said with finality, a sense of dread filling the bond between us.
	“More prattle.” Hades scoffed as he raised a hand up into the air.
	"I’m so sorry I left you alone for all these years, Hades."
	Her harsh reaction makes Emet-Selch flinch slightly, and for a moment, she is almost happy about it.
	Emet-Selch’s eyes widen for a moment.
	“In such vessels did the ancients preserve concepts—ideal forms to be drawn upon in the act of creation.” Urianger explained, turning to look at Emet-Selch.
	Hades could well imagine it: his friend recklessly throwing themself between a stranger and a beast and having their stomach clawed out in return.
	Whatever the thing that was Emet-Selch had now that passed for a cock seemed to curl within him, and despite himself G'raha felt a jolt of pleasure through the haze of pain that made his own cock twitch.
	She would not consider these things now, she still needed time to sort out these memories, especially if she meant to talk to Emet about them.
	Emet-Selch was meant to die and I couldn’t change that outcome.
	You feel like you lied, telling Emet-Selch you couldn’t drown.
	Aestelle spared him an acknowledging glance but remained quiet, not wanting to draw any further suspicion from the two men who have been wary of her since Hades’ introduction on their merry little adventure.
	Kindly, Hades blocked that noise out for him, and he relaxed a fraction, “If you’d accept it.” “Hmm…” Hades drew out, and across from him Hythlodaeus was watching them both hawkishly, his soul nudging at them to  play nice.
	Truly, Emet-Selch did not understand why he still suffered himself with the formalities of these meetings.
	“No.” She laughs then, good natured, “Aww, Hades.
	“Emet-” Hades didn’t allow her time to respond, opening a portal and retreating into the rift after saying his peace on the matter.
	This was  way more  intense than the friendly debates Mentor Metis set up between him and Hades and Hythlodaeus.
	But she will break the rest of us just the same if you will not forsake your pride, Hades.
	As the sole Unsundered blessed with the Sight, it fell to Emet-Selch to find their shattered brethren for uplifting.
	“I would have helped you,”  comes Emet-Selch’s equally harsh answer.
	Urianger, some time ago, before you defeated the Lightwarden Titania and met Emet-Selch, gave you an Auracite by which you might slay any potential Ascian threats you came upon.
	“Well, if you don’t tell me, I can either start looking, myself, or you can bring him out here to me if you do not wish me poking around in the tower that I clearly helped build at one point,” Emet gloated.
	The elevator stopped at the penultimate floor, and Hythlodaeus took barely two steps out of it before Hades accosted him, his soul a bright spark of frantic  panichopefearhopehope- !” Hades demanded.
	Normally you’d be a bit more composed, but Hades wriggles himself in your hold, stretching and reaching – you must wind out more and more aether from yourself to wrap him up more securely, hold him back several paces from the door.
	“Emet-Selch.
	With a snap Hades's lower garments fade to aether and he's immediately on her, but even in his hazy frame of mind he can't bring himself to throw her on the ground.
	Of everyone she would consider a true potential ally to her, Elidibus, and Hades, it would be him.
	The chilly anger in his timbre gives the Exarch pause, it was an angle he hadn’t considered: Emet-Selch, an Ascian, might care for the Warrior in some regard.
	But too many things only raise more questions, and Cassia feels herself tethering on the brink of despair once more, wondering if she had made a terribly wrong choice the first time she refused Emet-Selch’s offer to help her remember.
	"Boredom, the opportunity to mess with you, or simply because I can," Emet-Selch lists with a shrug.
	In a rare occurrence, the first step for the next Rejoining required Lahabrea and Emet-Selch working together.
	Perhaps with the impending peril their situation presented them with the Exarch would be more likely to acquit to Hades’ suggestions, though he doubted, even still, that he would be willing to fully listen to him.
	Emet-Selch stepped out into the hall and was met with the same quietness that was commonplace in the halls of most Amaurotine apartments.
	Hades will have woken up.
	There is a pained expression on his face as Emet-Selchs hands cover hers, making to pry them off, but Cassia is nothing if not determined as she pulls herself even closer until her lips nearly drag over his.
	“There is no need.” Elidibus is blushing, but still leaning into Emet-Selch’s hand, his lips catching on the knuckles of his fingers.
	Hades lifted his brows, the words dying one his tongue.
	Leaning back on the table, casually, not missing how his gaze remains fixed on you, you say, “I think you’ve come enough for both of us, esteemed Emet-Selch.
	Hades watched as she straightened herself, looking back at the book in his lap, “Nothing there either?” As Hades began to stack his tomes, Emilia collected her things and brought them over to her cleaver, bunching them up atop the ground she’d pierced for it.
	A chocolate muffin with a lot of cream just like… Hades had liked it… Emet-Selch thought of the memory-dream he had and felt oddly disquieted.
	Stay tuned for the next Emet-Selch chapter on Wednesday :3 It had been nearly two weeks since Ryne had told me about her dreams of Emet-Selch and the deal he made with Hydaelyn.
	Dark purple aether began to emanate from Hades' form and before she could react, cold chains snaked around her waist, pinning her arms and wings harshly to her body.
	“A valid concern...but if Elidibus intends to put his plans into action soon then we may need Emet-Selch despite the risks.” Cyella murmured.
	Though the crystal Emet-Selch had forged held memories of what was dear to him, the heart of Zodiark had tried to remain a resolute figure whose abstract duty was what mattered more.
	He had no partner in crime to force Hades to surrender to happiness, and so that was a burden he carried alone.
	She thinks that if she would have a face to go with Emet-Selch’s words, his lips would curl in distaste with the way his voice sounds.
	I was really hurt,” Prometheus muttered, “And I don’t like Hades being jealous and trying to interfere with my problems.
	Hades furrowed his brow, taking a step back and shaking off his thoughts, “Walk on, hero, I can manage.” She could only be around 5 foot 5 or so, and in his human form, Hades suspected he was somewhere around 6 foot 4—the comparison between the two had to be laughable.
	“I have a chaise lounge you can sleep on, if you really wish to be in my rooms, but you have not earned a place in my bed, yet.” Still, she laughed, and Hades considered that a victory.
	Hades brows shot up.
	The lights were already set, and the piano had been tuned and angled the way Emet Selch liked.
	Emet-Selch draws her closer at some point, shifts them until she is firmly in his lap as he holds her.
	He raised an eyebrow, lifting one of the vials—how had Azem managed to absorb that much of the aphrodisiac without becoming worse off than Hades?
	Hades eagerly set about the task of worshipping Hythlodaeus’s length, fingers digging into his hips.
	Emet-Selch would take off his coats for a change and make himself comfortable, and though the Exarch never deigned to so much as unhood himself, he felt both challenged and encouraged enough to provide tea and modest snacks in the manner of a polite host.
	Hades, curiously, turned a little pink, looking away from with a loud  harrumph,  “Just- I wanted a blanket.
	“Emet-Selch, finish your food.
	Hades moved away from me and turned to face them, putting his hands on his hips.
	For a few moments, Hades knew nothing else.
	He knows precisely which practical jokes Emet-Selch is referring to, of course, as he likely eagerly assisted in pioneering them with their aggravatingly creative partner.
	No wonder Hades was so upset with Alphinaud for trying to equate these mortal lives to the lives of their fallen brethren.
	Hades slid a hand up Azem’s torso, massaging the other half of their chest as they rocked their hips against Hythlodaeus with increasing desperation.
	“Well, Hades,” Hythlodaes begins, “my friend and I had been eyeing you for a while.” Hades did not know, at that point, that this was not going to be a choice.
	you ask with a confused frown, and when he draws back, Emet-Selch smiles once more.
	“I think she is more than ready for you.” Emet-Selch pumps two fingers into her, a second gush of wetness coming out with them.
	Azem crossed the room in a few long strides and knelt before them; Hythlodaeus gasped sharply, and Hades tried very hard to keep his expression neutral.
	He yelped, scrambling for his blankets as he quickly tossed them over himself, twitching when such abrupt, frantic movements made the beads  shift,  his face feeling like he could fry an egg on it as he stammered, “H-Hades!
	“Good,” Hades grit his teeth.
	All this to say, Hades felt angry…and more than a touch annoyed.
	I thought of Ascians having their own coffee shop called Amaurot, and across the street the Scions have their own coffee shop called Seventh Dawn, and there's this big dumb rivalry and Hades gets to flex his petty bitchiness in it.
	When she opens her eyes, she knows it's all still there, death and destruction whirling around, but the arms around her belong to Emet-Selch, and he holds her gently, in the eye of the storm.
	Your mind scrambles in the gutter to decide exactly what “sort of favour” Hades could offer, when a token of caprice strikes.
	“(Y/N), he’s been here an hour and already he tries my patience.” Hades slid his now bare hand to her neck, unbuttoning the high collar that hid the way he’d marked her.
	Hades, for his part, was stock still, as if moving even a centimeter would dispel this shared illusion of peacefulness.
	Emet-Selch was reeling from the small kiss that he could barely form words.
	"The end," murmured the voice of Emet-Selch, soft and low, next to his ear.
	When Hades awoke again, the table and chairs were gone, but a few new things had arrived.
	Feo Ul comes to the rescue and offers Aestelle a chance to help turn Hades' nightmare into a pleasant dream.
	“Perhaps,” Emet started, watching her like a predator as she stuffed her book into her bag and closing it with an audible snap, “you’ll ask me to indulge you in my knowledge as I did yours.
	“Hades,” Zodiark, he thought, I will never get tired of hearing my name from her lips.
	Hades slows his pace at the sound of his title.
	“Hades!”   Hades looked up at his love, holding him tightly.
	Hades struggled to pay attention to the physical world and the gently lapping, pressing feeling of Prometheus’s soul sinking into every inch of him, and probably would have walked blindly into a wall if it hadn’t been for his friend’s guiding hand.
	That’s the Hades you love, hidden deep past clever remarks and bored dismissals, past the veneer of pride and arrogance.
	Hades sighed and shook his head, but he was starting to smile, reluctantly amused.
	It was as if Hades’ fears were all at once annulled: he grasped you tighter, and carded his hands carefully through your hair.
	“Even in the lifestream, I….” Hades shook his head, as if to clear his thoughts, and began again: “If you’ve not yet come across the Emissary, this may come as a surprise to you.
	Hades paid him no mind.
	Hades stared down at the chessboard before him, and picked up the black king.
	Throwing them down beside the bath, Hades began to undress from the thin cotton top and bottoms he slept in, slipping his body beneath the water’s surface.
	Hades could feel the dampness of tears soaking into his shoulder.
	Her loyalties are to Emet-Selch.
	Regrettably, Emet was no longer the man he was in Amaurot.
	Hades cleared his throat, stepping aside to place down the tomes he’d carried from the library.
	“Uh huh,” Hades said, practically oozing doubt as he gave his friend a suspicious look.
	Hades returned his troubled expression to her, so many emotions running rampant behind his eyes, almost as if he’s fighting himself.
	Emet-Selch lets out a sigh.
	Emet-Selch’s arms around her tighten slightly, his breath warm on her skin as he replies in a far less cheerful voice, “The sun is not even up!
	Hades certainly seems to enjoy it though, judging by the short breaths, choked-off growls, and other assorted noises that sound very much like those she's pleasured with her mouth before.
	The moments that followed afterward passed by in a haze, but when Aeliana regained control of her faculties and focus, she found herself cradled in the warm comfort of Emet-Selch’s arms.
	Watched as Emet-Selch struggled to drag himself back under control, his soul a horrible, pitiful ball of grief.
	When Hythlodaeus released in him with a low, purring groan, Hades passed out, overwhelmed.
	And I had been for nearly five years at that point.” She takes a deep breath before she looks at Emet-Selch.
	Of course with the time and distance she’s managed to calm down, and so of course feels every bit as foolish as Emet-Selch had accused her of being.
	Emet-Selch’s hand tilts her chin further up, crouching lower so that all she can see is his face in front of her own.
	Emet-Selch sounds so derogatory, so disparaging towards people that she wants to rush to their defense, but at the same time, she knows that at least some of what he said holds a kernel of truth.
	Hades frowned at her words.
	But if she was to leave with Hades and Elidibus, even though Aestelle knows she’d visit often and offer to help with anything the Scions needed when time allowed for it, she can’t help but wonder if Alphinaud and Alisaie would see her leaving as a betrayal of their trust and friendship... What she’s more concerned with is what exactly will a future with Hades and Elidibus look like?
	Half-familiar, even, possessed of an echo of terrible power unique to Hades in all the world.
	“I  told  you,” Prometheus continued, his voice cracking, “I  told you  , Hades!
	She covered her nervousness the entire drive by asking Emet questions that were mostly meaningless.
	Emet-Selch is between your legs, responsible for all the sounds leaving your mouth and all the shivers running through your body.
	“What on Etheirys happened to you?” Emet-Selch asks as they stop in front of them.
	If Emet-Selch can repair but a fraction more of your soul, then it should hold well enough to bring you back to the Source.
	And to think I once thought highly of your kind.” Gaius scoffed, Hades glaring at him from over his shoulder.
	Emet-Selch's attention returns to Vala.
	Hades continued to sit with his arms crossed, but he tensed again, eyes narrowing at Her.
	If it wasn’t for Hythlodaeus giving her the Convocations crystals and her being able to hear Hades say that the fate of their home was now her own, she wouldn’t have had the strength to set their Emissary free from his duty.
	Helios pushes forward, Hades’s cock sliding easily down his waiting throat, no sign of a gag reflex to be seen; but Hades doesn’t have time to fully register it, as Hythlodaeus’s delicate hand cups his jaw.
	Hades.
	You have shown me that the impossible is never truly impossible and if saving you can be achieved through saving Emet and the Exarch, then you can count on me to stand by your side as well.
	“And I have no disagreements with that,” Emet-Selch agreed easily.
	A scene in-between; how Emet-Selch might interrogate the Exarch.Emet-Selch & Exarch, discussed WoL/Exarch and WoL/Emet.
	You can feel his breath in one ear as Emet-Selch's coolness presses up against your front.
	“A little,” Hades admitted, realising that he was lying on a paperweight, judging by the sharp pain jabbing into his lower back.
	"Will you look at that," Emet-Selch says with a satisfied growl, and when he moves his fingers in and out, you can hear how wet you are for him regardless.
	“You’re being very cruel, Emet-Selch,” she tells him, not at all serious as she tiptoes her way across the cold floor and snatches the mug from his hands.
	And so, regardless of what happens to her, she will find a way to save Hades from Zodiark's grasp and still halt the Eighth Umbral Calamity.
	Emet-Selch crouches before you, head cocked to the side like a bird.
	And much to Emet-Selch's mild annoyance, Azem was right.
	‘You don’t know how to hold your tongue, Hades.’ Back to your drills then, hero, you’ve had your fun teasing me.”  “Hades,  please,  ” she whimpered as she moved her hips roughly against my own, the force of her movement causing me to exhale sharply against her skin, the exasperation clear in her mind and voice.
	If Emet-Selch is the new designated target, she'll happily oblige and do whatever is asked of her to help.
	It took a bit, Prometheus feeling dazed and clumsy under Hades’s hungry gaze.
	When first they plot the Calamity after the disaster in the Thirteenth, Emet-Selch notices.
	Immediately, Emet-Selch was painfully awake, and he hastily grabbed at a blanket and covered himself with it.
	It was quiet and reserved, compared to the other times Prometheus would spontaneously visit him late at night, but Hades didn’t let it bother him.
	He could feel himself grasping for it, the crystal, the blade, but it was gone—torn through him.Hades could feel a deep chill running over him.
	Emet-Selch nodded, gesturing to his book, “The summon, if you please.” Hades sucked in a breath and removed the glove from his left, extending it atop the miqo’te’s outstretched pair.
	Your origins are yet a mystery, and a reversal for tempering─tempering by an ancient primal no less if Emet-Selch is to be believed─is simply unheard of.
	But where there are many Scions for them all to turn to in times of need, there is only one me so I have to prioritize Hades and Elidibus above all else.
	Hades and Hythlodaeus on the other hand could see with surprising clarity.
	“Hades,” he greeted, his voice a rumbling purr, “Rare for you to visit on these days.”  “I was bored,” was Hades’s reply, his soul fluctuating briefly.
	“Indulge me for a moment,” Emet-Selch said, “I’m going to tell you a story.” Emet-Selch ignored him, “Back when the world was whole, there were many cities, larger and far grander than anything you broken reflections have ever conceived.
	For a moment, both are silent until Emet-Selch heaves out a sigh so long you think he might just poof out of existence.
	Emet-Selch starts, paper crumpled in his gloves.
	Hades made love to her gently, too.
	There is nothing nefarious planned, though even if there were, what would the Warrior of Light and a powerfully unsundered specimen such as Hades have to worry about?
	From behind, Hades held them, murmuring praise into their shoulder, his hands and fingers caressing their hot skin.
	“Emet-Selch.” Hades knows not why he has been summoned, but here he stands in the anterior chamber of Zodiark’s makeshift palace.
	Hades blinked.
	But he only laughs, well enough, and you can tell that has Hades wavering, tongue stroking in slower motions until you pinch your nails into him in warning.
	“If you can think rationally when talking about me, then why can’t you do the same for Emet?
	“Taste all of her,” Emet-Selch says gently.
	“Your silence is damning.” Hades said with a scoff.
	Emet-Selch watched on as the hero’s charge began working over her unconscious form, now lain like a corpse across the surface of her bed.
	Even when his thrusts get faster, more intense over time, Emet-Selch seems to be in no hurry, perfectly content to draw this out as long as possible.
	“Of course, your appearance is nothing compared to your personality,” He continues, and you feel a wet lick on the inside of your thigh – Hades bears down on it in an open-mouthed kiss, trailing upwards – and you curl your hands for strength, “You are also brilliantly intelligent.
	I promise so  please  put away your gunblade.” She said, holding her hands up in some vain attempt to shield Hades.
	“...” Hades said nothing.
	Hades acted on sheer instinct alone, grabbing Prometheus and teleporting a few yards away as a monster crashed into the space they were mere moments ago.
	“You know, you’re welcome to come tag along Emet.” She said softly.
	“You must remember,” Emet-Selch tells him.
	Emet-Selch’s eyes narrow as he takes in Adriene’s shouted threats before he looks back at Cassia.
	Emet-Selch wouldn’t allow himself to even think otherwise for a moment.
	He abruptly found himself aggressively wrapped up in it, his arms pinned against his chest as Hades levelled him with a grim look.
	Not even Emet-Selch, and not even Azem.” He gives her an almost pointed look as he says the last part, as if he has it all figured out.
	What was left of Emet-Selch’s heart shattered to nothing.
	Emet-Selch watches her work, watches as roses and carnations wend their way into her creation, sprouting from the earth at her knees and getting snapped up by her fingers right as they bloom.
	Her body had betrayed her, rupturing in a series of small quakes while Emet relished in her afterglow.
	Hades sat slumped and crumpled at his desk, reclined back with eyes drawn half-closed in fatigue.
	“I can be,” Hades interrupted.
	But, Hades would have to wait to see.
	“Of course it was, the boy was never one for self-indulgence.” Emet-Selch scoffs with an aside wave of his hand before he pushes himself off the bookshelves.
	Songs for Hades:- Lovers Death by Ursine Vulpine, Annaca- Beautiful Crime by Tamer- Without You by Ursine Vulpine, Annaca- Innocence by Nathan Wagner (goes for both him and Aestelle tbh)- autumn breeze (london) by Jida, Rachel Lim- Sin Circus by Unlike Pluto It’s the mere idea that when she saves Hades, she’ll lose the Scions in exchange that shakes her to her core above nearly all else.
	Hades and Prometheus exchanged looks.
	“Emet-Selch is right,” Y’shtola finally sighed, settling back in her seat as she picked up her teacup once again.
	Said walls were a mess of writing, scrawled in spiky, rushed ink, initially starting off as semi-coherent calculations on Lifestream connections and replications, but slowly descended into absolute  insanity,  Hades not even able to make heads or tails of what these calculations were even  for.
	“It is  teeming  with Emet-Selch’s dark aether, you know.” I glanced down at her hand as she held it out to me.
	“Be careful,” Hades said.
	Prometheus’s aether  shrieked  , and in Hades’s Sight, that festering wound on his soul  ruptured.
	“No, no, this is quite interesting—I am content to watch.” Hythlodaeus perched on his chair, licking his lips as he looked Hades up and down.
	“He-Emet-Sech told me,” he started, leaning over to tuck a lock of hair behind my ear.
	Hades had some theories on why that was, but felt it wouldn’t be constructive to explain.
	Hades clenched his jaw—he’d felt it, the sudden fear, the grief; overpowering, hideous in its suddenness, it’s disgusting weight.
	“I only wish you’d put your mind to it more often,” Hades retorted.
	Emet hisses at the friction, bowing his head as you reach down to pull at the hem of the garment.
	Tens of thousands of years, and Emet-Selch has never been seduced before.
	Hades frowned at her words, it seemed regardless of the time, both Emet-Selchs knew exactly what she meant.
	A little thrill ran through him as Hades clutched him with desperate need, lips parting invitingly.
	“More than you may ever know.” Hythlodaeus smiled, leaning down, shifting Hades’s legs out of his way.
	Emet-Selch knew what that meant of course.
	“Prometheus, stay calm,” Hades said gently, soothingly, knowing better than to test  Valstrax’s  barrier - he helped him make it, so many centuries ago.
	Hythlodaeus immediately went for the cluster of blooming wildflowers near the edge of the clearing - drooping, bell-like flowers that were a beautiful shade of baby blue - while Prometheus turned to Hades and asked, “You want to climb that tree with me?” “No,” Hades said, because that sounded far too exhausting.
	“Emet-Selch, are you quite alright?” Emmerololth inquired with a small frown.
	"The boring block is a popular classic," Hades said dryly, and added in an undertone, "Also, I was the one who designed Igeyorhm’s home…" Hades closed his eyes for a good long moment, feeling a migraine coming on.
	“Emet-Selch, you’re going to let me heal you!” I blinked, looking at the girl.
	It was slow, so slow, Prometheus panting quietly when Hades pressed deeper and deeper into him, sinking into all the right  places, pulling and pressing as rhythmically as lapping waves, making him sway almost drunkenly on his feet.
	But it’s not simply a void, it’s Hades’ own aether.
	Emet makes not a sound as you enjoy the melody of the night, the soft puffs of his breathing the only thing to betray his presence.
	You know that as your hand clings more tightly to Hades, tensed and small fingers bending through his much longer ones, that you could not hope to stand on your own two feet.
	Hades kept finding himself looking down at her despite the view, questioning what she was thinking, what she had been feeling, dreaming.
	Holds Hades to her with teeth and claw digging into his skin hard enough to hold without breaking the surface.
	So many died─and she doubts Hades would want to hold any sort of service for those who were sundered─but it feels wrong not honoring their past somehow.
	"Everyone goes through it, Hades, like it or not.
	Emet-Selch nods, but hesitates before doing so, giving her a once over.
	There was a pause, one where Prometheus and Hades stared at their friend.
	“The people of this world call you ‘Warriors of Darkness,’ don’t they?” Emet-Selch muses as he looks from them back to Cassia.
	“I’m able to peek through that carefully placed mask of yours, Emet-Selch.” I placed my hand overtop his, pressing his palm flat against my cheek.
	Chapter Thirteen: The Seat of Azem (Emet-Selch&Azem, Ancients&Azem, Emet-Selch/Azem implied)  “In my journey to the first I met with Emet-Selch who told us of the ancients, the original peoples of this star who were sundered by Hydaelyn to prevent their downfall from Zodiark, splitting many of the ancients apart, Ardbert was the Warrior of Light form the first, he was another part of my original soul, the most recent seat of Azem on the convocation of the twelve, he joined his soul with mine.
	Hades, Hythlodaeus, and all of their friends and family made Amaurot her home, not the city itself.
	Emet-Selch looked incredibly astounded.
	“Emet is still sleeping back in his recreation of our home so when I do make it back, I’ll be heading there not long after I speak with everyone and hopefully I’ll be able to bring him back here for Beq Lugg to help me with his condition.” What exactly has happened to Emet-Selch following your triumphant battle?” Once everyone is back, we can have a conversation explaining to them Emet-Selch and Aestelle’s situation and hopefully move forward with the plan to save him.
	“Changed back?” Hades pondered over the words, then laughed.
	At least Hades believes what he’s doing is right and has never lost sight of his mission and goal or his conviction.
	Hades, called Emet-Selch, The Architect, Ascian, Paragon of the Source, Solus zos Galvus, Emperor of Garlemald fell asleep like that, clutching the Warrior of Light to his chest in the quiet stillness of a desert night, far from all the problems of the day.
	A moment of complacency was all it needed for Emet-Selch to pounce on the opportunity, as nearly proven just minutes ago.
	I…” Hades leaned closer, brushing the tip of his nose along her cheekbone in intimacy.
	Whether his impromptu trip served to cool his anger or stoke it further, Emet-Selch did not care.
	He smiled, and when he left that extraction chamber on Hades’s heels, it was with a slight spring in his step.
	Something of an incoherent moan stuttered from Emet-Selch’s lips when Hythlodaeus began teasing his taut ring of muscles, a gentle coaxing to relaxation before he slipped a finger inside.
	Hades’ hands were trembling when he said the words.
	Emet-Selch gives her a curious look.
	Emet startles out of his thoughts, eyes swiveling from the heavens to focus on your face in mild confusion.
	Thancred walked towards the exist as they all faced Emet-Selch.
	Even then, his sheer size almost made Hades topple over, his friend’s aether flaring irritably from the near trip.
	Emet-Selch turned away and snapped his fingers again.
	“We haven’t  scuffled  since we were kids,” Hades grouched, ignoring how Prometheus and Hythlodaeus stared at each other in disbelief at that  blatant lie  .
	It also made him feel uncomfortably hot, something he tried to ignore as Hades broke the kiss and started nosing along his jawline instead.
	"You have to concede that you were wrong to her, Hades," she whispered, happiness laced with sadness dancing in her mind.
	Though, it appeared today Emet was being more stubborn.
	"Isn't that right, my dear Hades?"
	“That, that is something best left unsaid.” Hades said with his voice sounding somewhat strained, no doubt from holding back his own tears.
	“Hermes can take care of himself, and perhaps some time alone is precisely what he needs right now.” Two strong arms snaked around her waist then to draw her close, and warm lips in search of those delectable little pleasure spots found the nape of her neck as Emet-Selch spoke quietly, “Whereas what you need is right here, with us.” Holding her caged within his arms, Emet-Selch guided her toward the center of the cave where Hythlodaeus already sat perched upon the edge of the hot spring.
	“You simply put your lips together as so” —Emet-Selch began to demonstrate— “and blow.” “As you wish, most honorable Emet-Selch.
	Emet-Selch's tongue slips past your lips, curling around yours as he deepens the kiss, and with a breathless sigh, you let go, wrapping your tired arms around his neck and dragging him closer.
	Emet-Selch doesn’t let up.
	Nabriales sat next to Emet-Selch and leaned into his personal space.
	When Emet-Selch slides onto the bed next to you, pinching the hardened tip of your breasts teasingly, you shudder against your bonds once more, but you find yourself unable to pull on them even the slightest bit.
	Venat nodded and left the room, passing Emet-Selch and Hythlodaeus as they walked to Azem’s bedside once more.
	“I want to spend an evening with you the way you like - the way you spent your evenings before I was here.” Hades gave into the urge to brush her hair out of her face.
	When unoccupied, Emet was expected to aid the Exarch in the tower, though they’d only just begun this agreement a night or two ago.
	Perhaps the newer Emet she’d grown to know was actually more akin to this one than she gave him credit for, he was just as annoying, sometimes—the memory made her cheeks feel warm.
	Oh, that makes you feel even warmer, a silly grin forming on your face, however Emet-Selch looks like Hythlodaeus has just sworn war on his kingdom (or empire, rather,  you muse).
	And that’s to speak nothing of how their opinions of her will change when they realize her true goal has been to save Hades─their enemy.
	A loud bang resounded and suddenly a bullet was flying past Hades’ head.
	Hades supposed he could just launch the damn thing in an ejection teleport, but to where?
	Emet-Selch was basically holding a shade of what was once Prometheus.
	You know now the truth of mine and his motives, and you know that Emet and I want nothing more than to see that life lives on even in this sundered state.
	Hades woke again as maids were moving quietly through the room, setting out a small luncheon for two on the balcony.
	Lest you forget that the Ascians are our enemies─Emet-Selch himself being at the top of that list with his constant presence in our affairs.
	Plain humility, because Hades has at least learned from his mistake – if he does not say so now, you will throw it back at him later.
	“  I’m going to drown you,  ” Hades snarled, “Unless you pull up that line, put your robes back on and  get back to work,   Fourteenth  .”  “  Vaca-”  Hades cut himself off, his voice strangling into a brief squeak of high-pitched rage.
	Hythlodaeus beamed at him and Hades stared deeply at the floor as if it was the most interesting thing in the world.
	Being conservative Jedi that they were, the apartments they had were rather small, so the distance from Hades’s kitchen table to his front door was pretty much the length of his arm + lightsaber (which he only knew because once he tried to see if he could use his lightsaber to open his door without getting up out of his seat or exerting effort using the Force.
	“I’m already here, so may as well,” Hades said easily, lowering his leg once he was done and banishing that cloth too.
	Hades nodded, watching her intently.
	“Emet-Selch handed this to me earlier.
	Two months later Emet-Selch stormed into his office.
	You  know  Emet-Selch had left marks.
	“This version of her is not nearly as beautiful-” Hades began his arguments.
	“Then the risk of someone becoming a Primal’s thrall grows,” Hades muttered, “Have you limited further Primal development since you discovered this?”  Hades frowned, clearly not approving of the idea, “Perhaps we should err on the side of caution.
	“Prometheus is currently  mentally unstable and suicidal, ” Hades snarled, and those words were ugly, thrown out there with such frustration and fear, “For all we know he’s throwing himself at them hoping he dies!” “Hades,” Hythlodaeus gasped, “Don’t say something so horrible!” Hades looked like he was going to snap something back, but he didn’t.
	Prometheus just finished his rant into the pillow instead - Hades was barely pressing down on it, allowing him to breathe.
	“It’ll be fine,” Hades said stiltedly, “Everything will go fine.” Hades hummed at Prometheus’s observation, more focused on the blueprints before him.
	“Everything fits well enough,” Hades replied, looking at his own appearance, “Though I’ll admit I...didn’t know you studied in the arts of tailory?” Hades frowned.
	As she sat, trembling and breaking, Emet-Selch appeared before her, lowering his hood.
	Hades lifted his hand to my cheek for a moment, but then dropped it and headed back into the Crystal Tower.
	They are tastefully done, but Cassia can’t keep her mind from drifting back to her conversation with Emet-Selch earlier that day.
	She watches him disappear into Emet-Selch’s bedroom, curiously.
	Hades had been blocking their Zodiark Concept proposal with the excuse that they couldn’t hold a vote without everyone present, but if one of their own was hospitalised for severe injury, then… Hades almost objected - a week was  nothing  for them - but he remembered the state of Prometheus when he tumbled onto his bed, screaming like he was dying.
	“You have been an abject failure as a partner to Emet-Selch.
	Hythlodaeus’ gaze was still somber, but Hades could make out other feelings in his aether.
	Quickly, Emet-Selch shrugged and deflected.
	Hades tutted, but he removed his hands and allowed the rotating aether and symbols to fade away.
	“Emet.” Emet-Selch pretends not to hear.
	“Well, hero,” Hades rubbed his eyes, massaging and wiping over his face, sighing, “It would seem you were correct.
	He savors every little bit of strain, every little display of resistance as she fights the bonds and tries to roll her hips in time with Hades' own.
	“You’re…not angry?”“Wait, we really beat him?” Alisaie chimed in now, looking to Emet-Selch with a look of both shock and pride.
	“I’m…certainly not complaining,” Azem moaned, leaning back on their hands as Hades continued his work.
	He glances up from his work as Emet-Selch comes in with your drowsy and half-asleep form cradled in his arms.
	Prometheus cautiously peeked over the edge of his duvet, bleary-eyed, to see Hades sprawled out next to him, one arm flung over Prometheus’s blanket burrito.
	Hades made no move to stop her, and smiled softly when she set the mask in her lap.
	“Hades,” You say lowly, feeling a thick branch of aether wind around your torso, “I am answering the door.” Hades seems wholly unconcerned with the development, instead reveling in a comically transparent surrender, taking his time to squirm close to your skin beneath your clothes, toy around your collar and your neck.
	Cassia briefly wonders if she should mention the things she has learned from Emet-Selch.
	Hades could never clearly remember what happened after that.
	Emet-Selch loves the dark, worships it, even.
	Emet-Selch’s lip twitched.
	Emet-Selch repeats the question like it’s an insult in his mouth, stepping towards you like he’s about to  pounce.
	A soft moan escaped Azem as they pressed into Hades, his slick entrance sucking them in.
	Emet-Selch holds you all the tighter for it.
	You can see it as clear as day when you close your eyes: the same room you’d seen before in your head, with a tired Emet-Selch with rumpled hair and clothes laying atop the middle of the bed.
	I felt irritation flit down the bond and took a moment to give Hades an encouraging smile.
	It’s just, she knew that her friends would never trust the Ascians, but she was still hoping that maybe by her openly saying she wishes to place her trust in Hades then at least they’d be open to the consideration of doing the same.
	“Y-yes, sir.” Hades nodded and clapped him on the shoulder.
	“Must you really be so blase about it, Azem ?” Emet-Selch sighed.
	At least Emet-Selch did me the courtesy of being honest.” His eyes burn the selfsame fire you saw when he saved you from Emet-Selch, when he summoned the Warriors from beyond the rift in your direst moment, and you wonder if you underestimated your mark.
	“Give it time, my love,” Emet-Selch murmurs before grazing his hand over her cheek.
	Maybe he'll show her what he can do with them on Hades and she'll let him play with  her  in kind.
	“H-Hi, Hades!” Prometheus chirped, his voice sounding strained even to him, “What a surprise!” “I got your letter,” Hades said, utterly  inscrutable  in both expression and tone, even though he wasn’t wearing his mask, holding up the letter he and Hythlodaeus had spent  hours  painstakingly writing and editing and writing  again.
	The Senate was surprisingly less fractious than they usually were, and though he presented the air of being on edge, Emet-Selch was particularly pleased.
	Yet Emet could not.
	Hades had already heard some discussions, done in the background of the archive room between some researchers when his head had been buried so deeply in reports they must’ve overlooked him.
	Emet-Selch stared at it for a bit, considering.
	Nothing else to do, since you haven’t started hunting the next Warden,” Emet-Selch sulked.
	No, your attentions are entirely reserve for the esteemed Emet-Selch, squirming and twitching in his chair, hands reaching down to thread into your hair as his legs finally spread wide, free to knock against the sides of the desk as his hips tilt gently into you.
	From her peripheral vision, Aeliana saw the look exchanged between Hythlodaus and Emet-Selch—one that nearly screamed an ‘I told you so’—as her heart dropped to the pit of her stomach.
	The Exarch released a little whimper as Emet-Selch found what he sought and plunged his hands into the robe, taking that rigid length -- yet yielding flesh, that was one mystery solved -- into his hand.
	“Are you satisfied that you got your revenge?” Hades asked, lips quirking into a lopsided smile.
	“So,” Hades said idly, “How does this work then?”  Hades pointed at the droid (sitting on his  kitchen table  he might add), “With every councillor he stabs, he’s promoted?
	Tightening her hold on Hades’ hand, Aestelle exhaled a small sigh and then nodded to the guards to open the doors to the conference room, her lover not looking nearly as anxious as herself.
	Emet-Selch shrugs.
	“What exactly are we doing with all of this?” Hades grumbled.
	The sudden shift in the aether behind them instantly caught Aestelle’s attention, no sound coming from his teleportation magicks this time around as Hades exits the rift.
	But just ere you allow yourself to sober with such thoughts, Hades laves his tongue over a pebbled nipple whilst pinching at the other.
	Hades’ breath stalled at the sight the blasphemy was obfuscating.
	Still, Hades didn’t press.
	Another tear rolls down the side of her face at the pure emotion behind the simple words, but when Hades opens his eyes again, there is something in them that makes Irene freeze.
	For one reason or another, usually unwillingly (or so he tells himself) Azem possessed the unique ability to distract Emet-Selch from nearly anything.
	Hades kept stroking his hair, though, as he thought about what just happened.
	Emet-Selch is dangerously close with his arms folded as ever, over his chest.
	Never one to hurry unless he deigned it important to do so or it suited him, that Hades.
	Emet-Selch’s head turns that direction and Xelinah doesn’t need to see his eyes to know the disdain written in them.
	“I  do not  undress Hades with my eyes!” Prometheus squawked, his face turning absolutely  scarlet  at the (true) accusation, “I-I have  never- the audacity!
	They sat in silence, waiting, Emet and company watching as he shifted down the stairs.
	You are brusque and cruel with the movement, though Emet-Selch allows himself to be pushed back.
	I warned Hades that this would happen and he refused to listen.
	“Are you ready, my love?” Hades whispered to the empty air.
	He felt the Exarch's fingers tighten on the fistful of his hair, dragging him down until he was hilted and holding him there, Emet-Selch drinking in the musky-sour scent of him and feeling his face grow hotter and his vision wavering again as he held his breath, wondering if the Exarch ever intended to let him breathe again.
	Hades paused, startled, and glanced back.
	Were it not against the spirit of it all, Emet-Selch would become physically ill at the very idea of it.
	Hades watched them for a few moments, amused by their yelling and giggling after one another.
	"Prom," Hades grunted, quickly giving up, "Ugh, it's too early for this."
	Emet-Selch looks back at her, golden eyes now visible.
	Hades didn’t pay him much mind, not until he heard Hythlodaeus suddenly snap, “Absolutely not.” Hades was on his feet in an instant, pushing open the door to the cabin.
	“Huh,” Hades said after a moment of silence, where they just kind of stared at each other for a bit, “You look terrible.” You’re not dying,” Hades sighed, looking amused as he approached.
	"I take back what I said about doing as what your little tale's version of me would have done,” Emet-Selch tells her, tone testy as the visuals still bounce like spiked glass within the back of his mind.
	“You’re not wrong.” Hades says, “I can’t deny that there seems to be some connection to Azem, no matter how thin it might be.
	Everything seemed blurry at first: a canvas of red and brown and gold, but your eyes adjusted relatively quickly, and you made out the distinct features of Hades’ own room.
	Hades watched as a ginger-haired miqo’te knelt to the bars to his hold.
	“Good,” she said with a small smile once she turned to face her friends once more, “I will always fight for what is right in this world, and if there’s no other choice but to kill Emet to save the First then I will be the one to do it.
	Hythlodaeus watched Hades falter.
	My brow furrowed as my head pulsed with pain, but I leaned forward and pressed my forehead against Hades’, sending my Light to him in a steady stream, praying that this would work.
	You did not eradicate Emet-Selch as you have our brethren before him.
	Such efforts as mine could never be in vain,” Preening, Hades nearly crowed his next words, taking a few lazy steps forward, twirling a bit, almost running straight into you.
	He tilted his head back, closing his eyes as he idly combed his fingers through his hair, his other hand pressing against Hades’s thigh, kneading into the firm muscle with his knuckles.
	As the silence returned, it dawned upon Hades that with his comment, he must have fractured some means of…neutrality, between he and the hero.
	It took only a cursory inspection for Hades to know that it wouldn’t even last another night; he’d burned so much magic over the past two days that he no longer had the power to sustain it.
	But Helios had played his cards right from the start: Hades’s own cock aches from the denied orgasm, interrupted arousal overpowering any and all reason he could reach for.
	Hades was the one who set her on her path originally, he was the one who nearly shred her soul from existence in favor of a God, a race of people, he still wanted to foolishly save.
	My vision was still technically black, as the sight right before my eyes was the darkness of Emet-Selch’s robes.
	Apparently asking Emet-Selch—an Ascian—who had suddenly appeared in the Scions’ headquarters, if he wanted something as mundane as tea, was what had finally caused the bubble of silence within the room to burst.
	"Tell me again what you want from me, dear," Emet-Selch demands as he thrusts into you hard enough you can't keep yourself from making noise.
	Denied, of course, by Emet-Selch's hand gripping her chin and Hythlodaeus' own securely fastened against her breast to hold her back.
	But has he been watching her encounters with Hades?
	“Oh come now, hero,” Emet-Selch taunted.
	His predatory smile sending a shudder through Hades, whose hands drifted up to grasp Hythlodaeus’s robes.
	Hades paused, but then continued rubbing his hair with the damp towel.
	Hades holds a hand up, “That would be the way of it, yes.
	I will be the one to save you and save our brethren, Hades.
	“People,” Hades said flatly, “Are you hurt?” He could still feel a faint thrum deep inside of him, but it was shared by Hades, so it barely hurt.
	The Exarch hesitated, and for a moment it looked as though he might refuse on some principle or another -- but no, he rose and left, slipping past that locked door into his personal chambers (and how Emet-Selch would love to see what he hid in there) and returning after a moment with one of the candles in hand.
	Now, Hades wasn’t the sort to throw stones in glass houses.
	Hades risks a glance downward, and immediately regrets it.
	“Was not plucking you from the lifestream enough?” Emet countered.
	“I don’t want to go to the party,” Hades said.
	It was not his pain, but hers, that made Emet-Selch hold his tongue.
	“It had nothing to do with strength!” I burst out, causing a smug grin to form on Emet-Selch’s face, and only then did I realize I had fallen into his trap of baiting me out of my pretend-slumber.
	Uimet scoffed, “We found him asleep in the shade of a tree near the ruins.”Emet’s expression soured, “And I was comfortable, mind you.” The Viera gestured to the group, admonishing him.
	“What do you think, Hades?” His name; a cue that you expect an answer.
	“Ah, haha…” Prometheus laughed sheepishly, leaning back on his heels with his hands raised when Hades’s soul bristled at him, “I’m joking!” Hades sighed explosively, tapping his fingers against the nose of his mask.
	“Someone seems needy…” Hythlodaeus remarked, hand wrapping loosely around Azem’s throat as he guided their head aside, allowing him to study Hades.
	Curiously, the Exarch visibly jumped at the sound of Emet-Selch's footsteps, and he whipped himself around to face his uninvited guest.
	He inhaled sharply as I implored, and I pursed my lips, wondering why I didn’t use Emet-Selch, the name I knew him by and had exclusively been using until now.
	Aestelle opens her eyes and holds Hades' hand up to her cheek, watching him for even the slightest signs that he might be waking up.
	I’m not sure if Emet ever told you this, but I grew up alone outside of Amaurot and drifted between villages and towns until I one day ended up here.
	Emet-Selch chuckled, a dark, ugly sound.
	Hades took in a breath, leaning forward to rest his elbows upon the tops of his thighs.
	“Varis…” Aestelle murmured under her breath before shifting her attention back up at Hades.
	"Emet-Selch is my title, and what the other Convocation members call me.
	“Oh, very well,” Emet-Selch said with a click of his tongue.
	Upon a second glace, Hades realized that his aether admonished the same brightness as she-the blessing, though faint in comparison to his mentor.
	When Emet-Selch appears in the aftermath of their battle, his eyes linger on her.
	Hades found pen and ink and paper in her desk, but was forced to carry a chair and small table to her bedside.
	She believed this to be a world with enough majesty to conquer the sorrow that captured the pain both he and Hades felt.
	“Morning, Hades!” Hades jerked out of his thoughts when Prometheus suddenly  yelled  down his ear, making him practically throw his unfinished report high in the air as his heart tried to leap out of his damned  chest.
	Was Hydaelyn telling me to be wary of Emet-Selch?
	Emet-Selch’s eyebrows furrowed, his golden eyes boring into me.
	For us, too.” Aestelle heard Allie say, her voice being carried along on the wind the further Hades walks her away from Gaius and his children.
	Emet-Selch gives a dramatic bow when she arrives, placing the green gem in her palm.
	“You actively seduced me, Emet-Selch,” she muttered, releasing the sash to grip my chin and force me to look at her once more.
	Emet saunters in behind you, the smirk on his face extremely loud.
	Emet could see beneath the hood that the Exarch was blinking away sleep and stepped back.
	Emet-Selch's eyebrows narrowed at the Hyur but ultimately he sighed.
	Emet-Selch strolls across the room, walking to the side, circling.
	Hades had been right, afterall.
	“If you truly trust me then come along.” Hades said while he turned around, his smirk evident in his voice alone.
	That Solus would use the exact same words as Emet-Selch had spoken to her in the cave when teaching her magic - coincidence seems the only valid explanation.
	Even if she knows this is nothing more than a recreation from Hades’ memories, walking among these shades through Amaurot feels natural, right.
	“Hades!” he cried, but Hades was already gone, and Hythlodaeus hesitated, unsure.
	“You wanted honesty, Emet-Selch.
	The idiot looked up at him, and Emet-Selch looked away the moment he glimpsed familiar, golden eyes.
	Have you already forgotten who your enemies are,  hero?” Hades asked as if he himself didn’t just suggest this very allyship.
	Right now, his friend was leaning over his chair, his hands pressing uncomfortably heavy on Hades’s shoulders, forcing him to slouch forwards slightly.
	Hades immediately realized Hythlodaeus had played him for a fool—no doubt he noticed Hades had had the wrong idea about the entire affair from the start, and yet he further fed into misunderstanding all the more.
	“Or should I say, the most honorable Emet-Selch?
	My slower pace matched Emet-Selch’s, and now that we walked side by side, I noticed the way his gaze seemed to linger on me before turning elsewhere.
	I feel like I could have written more snarky back and forth between Emet and Gaius so I'm going to work on that in the chapters to come when venturing into the Sorrows of Werlyt plot.
	His eyes go from where Hades is watching-- and oh how those golden  eyes  see it all!-- to the woman's lovely set of broad shoulders and the expanse of her back he has paid quite the homage to.
	No warm trickle of his life fleeing him, no tearing of flesh nor sharp scrape of bone on bone (he was both sure that bullet had shattered a rib on impact, and equally sure that Emet-Selch was a good enough shot to hit precisely where he meant to) and no more darkening of his vision as blood filled his lung and robbed him of his senses.
	Hades's fingers twitched around his armrests..
	"If you ask for more, I will gladly provide," Emet-Selch says with a hint of promise, and a moment later, the thick head of his cock presses relentlessly against the tight muscle of your ass.
	“You’re not the only one with a special trick up their sleeve,” she told Emet-Selch and the amusement rang rich in her tone of voice.
	Y’shtola ?” Emet-Selch sighed, “Your memories so do resemble that of gnats.” Emet-Selch had saved Y’shtola’s life, something that made him both grateful - and deeply uneasy.
	Emet-Selch was flirting with him, going through the motions of their usual -- gods, how he loathed the both of them right now -- foreplay.
	“It’s all well and good to leave her behind, Hades, but what happens if the aether you gave her fades.
	The thought of Emet-Selch, sorcerer of eld - fleeing at the prospect of another rebuke, Elidibus opening a window to spite him finally strikes Altruoix as as funny as it ought to be.
	Hades looked away.
	“He said Emet-Selch would be freed after He spoke to us,” Alisaie remarked bitterly.
	Emet-Selch of the Convocation of the Fourt— With a groan, Emet-Selch stomps away, yanking his arm out of reach when he hears a laughing Hythlodaeus catching up to him.
	“You will address him as Emet-Selch,” I said, poison dripping from my words.
	“It’s fine, everything is better now,” Hades murmured, reaching out - and pausing when Prometheus flinched away from him, “Prom, everything is  fine.
	When I woke in the morning, Emet-Selch’s arms were still around me.
	“What do you want me to do?” Hades purred, clearly delighted at how  undone  Prometheus was, “Use your words.” Hades tutted, “Not those words.” Prometheus whined, digging his heels right into the sofa and restlessly moving his legs - as much as he could with Hades sitting on him anyways.
	Emet-Selch sighs, this time sadly, “I’m sure you will, my dear.” “Take care Hades.” “You can come out now.” Emet-Selch calls after the silence stretches on.
	One of his hands disappeared behind Emet-Selch, and Aeliana felt more than saw what Hythlodaeus did then.
	All you need to do is pull back; Hades can’t reach too far forward, otherwise someone will see.
	Hades getting  drunk  was a rarity, which meant his letter had actually  driven him to drink.
	She can’t help but wonder how Hades must be feeling right about now after that talk they had only an hour ago.
	He could sense Hythlodaeus and Hades in there - and no doubt they could sense  him  - but with him blocking everyone out, he couldn’t quite gauge the mood in there.
	Emet-Selch did not bother to restrain his look of pure contempt.Perhaps were he slightly more sober, he may have played it off with his usual whimsy and amused indifference.
	From behind the huntress, with endearing sheepishness, Emet-Selch looks aside.
	Hades said nothing.
	Hades eyed me for a moment, confusion in his thoughts.
	Emet-Selch’s, no, Hades’ words stay her hand, keep her from bursting out how ridiculous all of this is.
	“Dear,” Hades crooned, “Was that a bit too intense?”  Hades chuckled, and with a quiet snap his fingers, dismissed the cockring (much to Prometheus’s relief).
	Hythlodaeus said, arrogance in his voice, that he’d known it would; Hades retorted that it was because of his efforts and nothing Hythlodaeus had contributed.
	Hades glares at him from over Vala's shoulder.
	“That color is unmistakable and wholly unique, Hades.
	Emet-Selch chuckled as he picked it up, resting it on the edge of the bowl.
	“Wha...” Prometheus said stupidly, staring as Hades stepped out of arm’s reach and readjusted his rumpled robes, “Now?
	Her fingers flex against Hades' thighs, claws tickling the sensitive skin as she waits for further instruction.
	“We’ll wait then,” Hades sighed, “Is there a dark corner I can hide in?” It wasn’t really all that better, he was still being buffeted on all sides by all this  noise,  but at least he and Hades could sulk together in the corner without being bothered by people wanting to chat with Convocation members.
	Hades smirked.
	Hades watched as the hero began to close off from her comrades, her soul’s essence now turning over and blocking out it’s brilliant, cesious sheen from his view.
	“It’s not a pad-” Hades stopped, realising there was a way to end this conversation.
	Prometheus made a noise like he’d been knifed in the heart, and he leaned in a fraction, just a fraction, leaning into Hades’s hands as his eyes closed, a ragged breath leaving him-  “Come home, Prom,” Hades said, “Please.”  For the briefest of moments, Hades felt a flicker of bottomless, agonising grief open up like a gaping hole in Prometheus’s soul, so deep and empty it almost pulled him into it.
	Hades pinched his eyes shut, tears beginning to well in his eyes.
	“Then you ought to finish playing with her hair and allow her to get dressed,” said Emet-Selch before he caught Aeliana’s eye.
	“Yes!” Elidibus’ voice trembles, and he tries to crane his head back to meet Emet-Selch’s lips.
	The interior of the Crystal Tower was as bright as Emet-Selch always remembered it, a cooler and less harsh light than the one without that bathed the world in perpetual sunlight.
	Merely canted his hips further into his scorching mouth, shuddering when Emet-Selch hummed his approval around his cock.
	“I don’t want other men touching you in our bedchamber.” Hades’s voice was hard.
	But, where were Prometheus and Hades?
	“Hello, Hades,” Hythlodaeus said, bright and cheerful and oh so amused.
	When the summons came from the administration, Hades was surprised to find that it was from the Akadaemia headmaster himself rather than his departmental dean.
	The tranquil waters that filled the hot spring started sloshing over the edges the more Emet-Selch squirmed, caught between his two partners who spared no effort in seeing his every need met.
	Hades watched as she repeated these newer movements, thinking back to their battle, together in the Tempest.
	“Hades.....   Hythlodaeus   ....”   The Exarch had said to no one, yet the words, the names burned into Emet’s heart.
	Hades clenched his teeth.
	“Prometheus,” Hades said quietly, and he went rigid, forcibly turning his head in the opposite direction of his voice, “It’s not an insult.” Hades sounded the same,  felt  the same,  that  was the insult.
	The creature’s unclear connection with Azem aside, Hades isn’t going to put himself on the line for her mysterious agenda.
	A while later, Emet-Selch found me curled into the plush armchair by the window, staring up at the night sky, bathed and waiting for him.
	Emet waited, watching for another long moment before he soundlessly walked to the side of the bed and sat.
	Hades tries to hide the truth from him.
	He was passionate about his work, but Hades worried he was going to self-destruct one day.
	Hades had  felt  the ugly surge of betrayal and anger and despair from Prometheus as he lashed out at his soul’s touch, and Hades had given him space, bewildered and wounded.
	They urge you to return home, ask after how your partner, the esteemed Emet-Selch is faring.
	The musical aspects in this chapter really made me giddy to write coming from and studying as a professional musician, so I hope they give you the fuzzy good feels as much as they did for me~ little bb Hades...getting picked on by Perse...I live for it...hehehe.
	"Do I have to say  please, Emet-Selch?"
	“Emet.” Your cry of his name is more like a sob.
	“If you ever knew me, Hades,” she says at last, after long moments of tense silence.
	Hades turned, too, and went to place a hand on our friend’s shoulder, but he shot out of his seat.
	His hand closed around Hades’s, the physical contact making their spiritual one curl warmly.
	She shivers beneath the question and the way Hythlodaeus says Emet-Selch's true name.
	I still can’t believe even she got roped into this elaborate scheme to get Hades and I to dance together that night.
	It will be a long night, Emet-Selch thinks to himself as Elidibus takes his cock into his mouth all the way to the root.
	"Here is where you erred, little  hero  ," Emet tells her, voice unusually soft and low, and watches the way she flinches at the word beneath his hand and watches him with that same desperate look as before.
	Emet-Selch is exactly the sort you’d expect to enjoy lounging around and being touched.
	His cock is trapped between them, pressing hard against her stomach, and she smiles at him when she sees her movement sending a bout of pleasure through Emet-Selch as well.
	So, what exactly is it Hades is wanting to show her this time?
	Behind us, Emet-Selch sighed.
	“I don’t care, keep your distance, or else…” she threatens again, and it sparks something in Emet-Selch’s eyes that doesn’t bode well.
	The Gunbreaker stayed back, standing along Hades’ side.
	I have taken note of him...the esteemed Emet-Selch.
	Hades stood up from where he’d been languishing on the nearest flat surface.
	The sight of the esteemed Emet-Selch – having skipped the Convocation meeting today, quite scandalous – stretched out on your couch, fully in the nude, would be surprising enough in itself.
	Emet-Selch leaves feeling empty and incomplete.
	Aletheia knew better than to ask, and in her limited worldliness there was solace in cutting her losses and taking what Emet doing in her bed with her would consequently mean.
	“Well, just after our final battle,” I began again, earning a frown from Hades.
	Hades nodded and Hythlodaeus averted his eyes for a moment.
	Emet-Selch scoffed, keeping his eyes on the unconscious Warrior of Light who trembled beneath her covers.
	Hades chuckled, “If you are offering me a chance into the Lifestream, Hydaelyn, you waste my time.” The very thought of her extending that choice, extending compassion, made rage roll through him.
	“...Prom?” Hades tried softly, his voice hushed like he was speaking to a wild, dangerous animal as he edged forwards again, “It’s me.
	“I see Oblivion has claimed him.” A singe of regret colored his expression, “Emet-Selch-gone.
	“Come here, Hades,” Hythlodaeus beckoned as Azem lost themselves in a sea of sensation.
	Emet’s words stuck with him; if he, if the Ascians, the beginning people could be tempered, those perfect, immortal beings-was he, Emilia, tempered as well?
	Good luck on your courtship, Emet-Selch.
	Hades glanced over the exposed spines near his armchair, searching within the pile he’d yet touched.
	Aza was doing the grim task of chasing off buzzards from the cart tracks in anticipation of using them in the hopefully near future, nimbly stepping on the planks when Emet-Selch literally popped out of nowhere and nearly startled him right off the tracks.
	As if sensing this, Emet curls his fingers into her, clutching her close to his shoulder as she climaxes.
	Standing there with moonlight cascading over his onyx black robes is Hades.
	Emet-Selch was at my side in a moment, gripping my chin and turning it towards him, inspecting me very carefully.
	The reality that she can fail yet again is so very real still and where she could say before she had no choice but to do the things she did, now that she’s in possession of a portion of her memories, she can’t use her ignorance as her defense and excuse should she have to kill Hades a second time.
	That was Emet-Selch's question.
	She seems to have dozed off, so Hades whiles away the minutes by picking stray leaves from her hair.
	With some concern, Hades realised that Prometheus's aether levels were so low he was practically invisible to aether sight.
	Hades remains a moment longer, Elidibus and the Convocation momentarily forgotten as he watches the woman he loves.
	“What?” Emet-Selch rasped, “What, what did you want to save?
	A fact I discovered when he attempted to use it on me.” G’raha recounted, surprising most everyone in the room with the only exceptions being herself and Hades who long since already knew this truth.
	And for the first time, Hades took it without argument.
	When Emet-Selch opened his eyes, he saw the Exarch now held the still-lit candle over the bare skin of his stomach.
	When Olivier’s reply was not immediate, Hades set his jaw.
	“Call me that again, and I  will  turn you into an otter for a month,” Hades said without any heat, tugging his mask off and sweeping his hood back in one motion.
	Lahabrea had scrawled Hades’s number on the side, “Huh.” Unfortunately, he came back during Hades’s off day.
	“Your talk with Gaius was an interesting one.” Emet said, his voice reaching her before she saw his portal whirl to life beside her bed and he stepped out from the rift to greet her.
	Hades had narrowly pulled his beloved out from the rubble before another building fell, but now he was wondering if it was worth it.
	Prometheus’s body was bestial, heavier, more limbed than Hades’s still humanoid yet sinewy form.
	“Does it matter?” Hades asked, crossing his arms and resting his cheek on them, his eyes closing.
	“I did,” Emet-Selch replies slowly.
	When he grabbed her wrist and began yanking her back to Fanow, Hades stayed near and watched as she was manhandled, bruises later appearing on her wrist that night.
	“Uh,” Hades shrank back a bit when Hythlodaeus fixed him with one of  those smiles  , the polite, gentle ones that somehow exuded pure  threat.
	“Ryne,” Hades called over him, looking back towards where we were standing.
	Hades remarks with an all-knowing smirk.
	In his mind, Emet rolled the idea of teaching her how to please him as an example for herself, and then to the possibility of grooming her to his own liking.
	Her staff adored her, and she pitched in just as much with the chores - despite Hades’s many attempted interruptions.
	But, just as Emet-Selch’s real name was Hades, I suppose I would soon find out what Azem’s…or, my true name was.
	In those days, the Crystal Exarch treated Emet-Selch with little more kindness than a particularly poisonous snake; always disappointed to find him, constantly trying to usher him out of the Tower, and listening to all of his honeyed words with complete disbelief.
	“I have to, do I?”  Emet-Selch interrupts her, sounding almost a little amused.
	Well-warranted grumbles, indeed, but no matter your fumbling, Hades and Hythlodaeus remained, and their support is enough to keep a grimace from your features.
	Hades enters to find you waiting, patiently, on the bed, completely robed, your mask carefully secured on your face and the hood of your robes drawn up.
	Lahabrea is already gone, all that’s left is for her champion to go and slay Emet-Selch and lastly Elidibus.
	“I suppose they are more experienced in this field…but I so hoped you would endeavor to impress me, Hades.” Not one to disappoint, Hades let go his inhibitions and began to rock his hips in sync with Azem, a soft groan rumbling in his chest as the sound pressed deeper inside him.
	“Thanks, Emet-Selch,” he said, glancing over to Hythlodaeus to give him a more subtle thanks for easing Hades up from his earlier snit by brushing up against his soul’s border like a purring cat.
	Regardless, nothing was too hyperbolized for Emet to draw conclusions of his own.
	The longer I stared, the more turmoil it wrought inside me and I frowned deeply, thinking about what Hades had  just  told me about using my abilities.
	It’s Hades.”  “It is,” Wary now, Hades stopped just out of arm’s reach, finding himself uncertain on how to proceed.
	“It’s not like I haven’t dealt with Zenos before, though,” I noted, but the look Emet-Selch gave me assured me I was about to be knocked off my high horse.
	A page taken from his book as she curled her free arm around his lower back and repeated the trick he’d used on Emet-Selch only moments ago.
	Smirking, Hythlodaeus ran his thumb over the very tip of Hades’s penis, tracing firmly around the hole at the end.
	“He didn’t, then,” Hades slides closer to you, his shoulder bumping your own, “And I promise, for the rest of my life, everything that happens to me-” He tsks in mock chastisement, “Is that any way to speak to the most honorable Emet-Selch?
	“I will always be Azem and a member of the Scions...but more importantly, I am yours just as you are mine, Hades.
	He ached with such an intensity it was like he had been struck, and the ache grew ever more terrible as Emet-Selch applied a thousand little gestures intended to tease and draw G'raha to the precipice without ever allowing him to tip over it, an irresistible pressure building within him with no release promised or permitted.
	Emet-Selch knows he is not a good man.
	He had good instincts, was very impulsive when it came to defining his Concepts, and Hades had only seen him sort-of plan something out on paper and pen  once, and that was to doodle some duck-beaver hybrid with ‘venomous?’ scrawled next to it.
	“I came to check up on you,” Hades said, keeping his tone idle, like it was perfectly normal to stalk his friend halfway across the ruined world, “Your seat is still open for your return.” “I wasn’t worried about that,” Hades half-lied.
	He jumped a little at Hades’s voice, and he turned to see his friend approaching with Hythlodaeus.
	She raises her chin, that defiant streak that flares up whenever she exposes herself, and Emet-Selch replicates her act as she makes Elidibus turn to her with the back of her hand.
	You hadn’t noticed, either, but Hades saw the light blush, just barely visible from below your mask.
	She can tell that whatever spell Emet-Selch had used earlier to suppress it is fading fast.
	I wanted to trust Emet-Selch.
	“We ought to—” Hythlodaeus started but when he turned to face Emet-Selch beside him, he found his friend already gone and making a slow approach toward Aeliana.
	Hades’ patience begins to run very, very thin.
	Emet, I mean.
	“Good  mornin - ah, Emet-Selch.
	Hades started.
	And Emet-Selch lifted up his robe, fixing him with one last glimmering look before slipping aside his smalls and wrapping his mouth around his impossibly hard cock.
	Hades had spent a long time considering what he would say when he saw her next, and every day that passed had made it harder.
	Just beyond the bridge that connected the Twelve Wonders to Anagnorisis beamed that unmistakable blue and Emet-Selch summoned forth his most reliable, four-legged familiar.
	Aletheia did not respond, allowing Emet to ruminate on the lasting words Elidibus left him.
	It had fallen to Prometheus and Hades to handle the management this century.
	Emet looked at the sleeping form, chest rising and falling slowly.
	There’s a taste in his mouth that’s honey but sweeter, brighter, more green and white than gold, leaving his tongue and lips and throat feeling numb and full and swollen and wanting as he swallows the kiss that Emet-Selch gives him.
	They’re more likely to try and say Hades has somehow used his magic to put her under a spell of sorts, implanting false memories into her head so he could manipulate her or some other nonsense Alphinaud is likely to conjure up in that boundless imagination of his.
	He started to grin when Hades started to  wiggle  and made a  very amusing  expression and a quiet, choked off noise when Prometheus finally realised what he hit upon.
	“Do you remember what it is you asked me?” Hades suddenly spoke up as they slowly walked through Amon’s room, the vibrant red of the walls a stark contrast to the crystalline blue of the Tower.
	Hades frowned; he’d slept well through another day.
	In the distance, though, Hades felt like the cloudy sky threatened the potential of rain.
	“You were brought here at Emet-Selch’s behest, to tend to your wounds before you are reunited with the Warrior of Light.” “Hades, such volume of Light is not to be underestimated,” Hythlodaeus warned, understanding in his voice as he, too, came to realize my new plan.
	Emet-Selch turned lazily to Krile, and I shot him a look that I prayed he could feel, willing him not to call her a dwarf as he had with Tataru.
	A low groan rumbles from your lungs when Hades hoists you aloft with such ease and carries you to the door of your flat, lips never breaking for air for all the fervency.
	“She  took everything,” Emet-Selch muttered, his tone venomous, “He couldn’t  remember my name.
	Lost in my observations as I was, I failed to realize Emet-Selch beginning to slow his pace, and so the arm that had been guiding me along with him suddenly turned into a restraint as he stopped me in my tracks, turning me towards a house before us.
	I jumped in my seat with a gasp at the suddenness of the action and Hades’ hand clamped around my own as he watched.
	They imagined he must have been enjoying the show, and little wonder, given how stoic Hades attempted to be much of the time.
	Azem’s eyes meet Emet-Selch’s briefly as she sheds her robe, and this always leaves him breathless: to see her naked, to know that she trusts him enough to be revealed and vulnerable.
	Otherwise you and Hades would continuously misunderstand each other and get into plenty more fights.
	“You had a dream about me?” Emet-Selch’s eyebrows rise up as he looks her up and down.
	Hades exhaled irritably, pointedly ignoring the banana Prometheus was waving a mere inch from his nose.
	Hades chuckled, wrapping Hyth’s hand in his.
	“Emet?” Hades swallowed as the hero’s eyes met his, staring up at him with a modicum of concern and glee, “I-I’m fine.” He stated, now aware that he had stopped walking to stare at the woman.
	The faces Emet-Selch saw upon teleporting into the throne room were not the ones he expected.
	Hades moved to follow me, but paused when he reached the two men.
	The future is where we belong together, Hades, not lost in our memories.” Hades grasped her hand even tighter.
	It’s bad enough when Emet-Selch as the supposedly evil villain treats them as nothing more than things to be discarded.
	It looked as if it was figuring out its limbs enough to move now, but Hades saw no point in lingering.
	“What?” Emet-Selch frowns and blinks in confusion, seemingly not entirely sure what she is trying to say.
	“H-Hades!” Aestelle gasped only to giggle some after the initial shock had passed.
	"Spring is for  mating  , Hades."
	Emet-Selch strokes her cheek, watching Elidibus bob his head as he sucks her clit, his tongue folding around it like he needs to wring her out completely.
	If Hades hadn’t been here… Hades felt something in him hesitate, the pause filled with Prometheus crying and the monster wailing.
	A playful tease and prodding at a small ring of muscles that coaxed Emet-Selch’s pleasures to a new height and within seconds, he growled his release that burst forth and left her so full.
	“E-Emet-Selch, D’ve?” How could Hades even look at her, knowing what lied beneath her fragmentations, the light?
	“Lady (Y/N),” Hades corrected reflexively.
	Hades found that he was holding his breath.
	"No, I don’t," Emet-Selch hisses, aware that something in him stirs every time you look at him, and oh how he  hates it, just like he hates that half of his mind seems to turn off every time Azem looks at him with fondness in her eyes.
	I closed my eyes for a moment, remembering the last conversation I tried having with Hades.
	“She isn’t Persephone, Emet-Selch.
	At her honest reply, Emet-Selch only scoffs dismissively.
	This is how you create a god: Emet-Selch is the one who holds the knife, the tip of the blade pressing into the soft skin he kissed just hours ago.
	“My poor Hades—your cock is drooling all over the floor!” Hythlodaeus teased, flashing teeth with his smile.
	Pulling her dusty robes up around herself, Persephone fixes Hades with a sobering look as she asks, "what happens now?"
	“If I were not the benevolent God I am, I would have just taken you and been done with it.” Beside me, Hades scoffed and rolled his eyes.
	“Hmph.” Azem shifted around on the bed so they were in front of Hades.
	The… so, I need this- this message is for Emet-Selch, Hades- for him.
	“Hades,” he said, taking up his own glass of wine, draining it.
	I turned my back on Emet-Selch as he continued to talk to Ryne about the contents of his book.
	Hades eyed him.
	“And what praytell, does he mean by that?” Emet-Selch hisses at her.
	Hades was patient.
	It was a wonder just how much Emet-Selch had proven capable of when he was set to a task, but Hythlodaeus had always felt that way about his friend.
	My eyes widened and I gripped Hades’ arm tightly, a cry escaping me.
	Please, Hades.
	Hades grasps you powerfully around the waist and the distress feeding off from him is made plain by how tense he feels against you, in both flesh and something else you only now have the presence of mind to wrestle—something about his aether.
	Why…did Hydaelyn bring Emet-Selch back?
	“Such things can be pursued at any time, my dear,”  Emet-Selch points out with a small scoff.
	It's in his gesturing while holding both of your hands in his own; in his smiles as he tells the story of a younger, tinier, and always frowning Emet-Selch as he fought to control his special power to see the colour of souls and how he'd decided to approach him, knowing they shared the same hardship; and on the fondness in his voice as he adds tidbits of their growth together, like how they stopped seeing their power as a burden that only gave them headaches back then and learned how to master it despite the difficulties.
	“‘Shtola, Ryne, can I trust you both to talk with the others on my behalf and convince them to help save Emet?” Aestelle asked, glancing between the two girls.
	Something of a growl rumbled up Emet-Selch’s chest.
	“What kind of name is Emet-Selch?” Irene asks when her breath finally evens out.
	“Perhaps,” Emet-Selch purred, “With proper motivation.” “Hm,” Emet-Selch turned away from him, looking out over the dusty, rocky plains stretching away from the cart tracks.
	When I woke the next morning, I opened my eyes to Hades walking out from the bathing room, his hair wet.
	Hythlodaeus was at his apartment and answered the door with a smile when Emet-Selch knocked, inviting him inside with a self-assured air about him.
	"You're not some  apex predator  , Hades.
	After her victory over Hades, however, she stopped scrying her fate and hasn’t done so since.
	“Hades…” she cries weakly.
	“You used the Light to remove Zodiark’s tempering..?” Hades asked softly, his chin resting on her shoulder while his arms lie lifelessly at his sides.
	G'raha mouthed a handful of syllables around Emet-Selch's claws, muffled and incomprehensible.
	“The Oracles are on our side,” Hades continued.
	But as bad as it got, and as empty as I felt...I can’t even begin to imagine what it must be like for Emet-Selch.” With the stars as her guide, with Ardbert as her trusted ally, and with Hades’ promise (even if it’s an empty promise), all will give her the strength to press on.
	There was an unpleasant niggling in the back of his head, that petty and annoying feeling of being left out of something, but the truth of the matter is that even if Azem  had  come knocking at his door, begging with those luminous orange eyes and pouting lips that they  really really  needed his help, Emet-Selch was far too busy at the moment to spare any time or energy for such things at the moment.
	Emet-Selch merely shrugged.
	Hades had not lived beyond the world’s Sundering.
	She's already dealing with Emet-Selch's calling to her in a manner that will ensure her destruction as she is… was…  will be  his own in time.
	It is impossible for your hips not to meet Hades in the middle with every bend and pump of his hand, throwing your head back and rutting against him unrestrained.
	Without his magicks, his aether, Hades-though reluctant to admit-was in no state to argue.
	“We-,” I started, turning to Emet-Selch as I began slipping back into my smallclothes, stopping short when I beheld the smirk on his lips.
	Hades nodded, laying his coat and gloves atop the table in a folded bundle.
	Hythlodaeus always gushed how romantic it was, much to Hades’s… not discomfort but… it always left him feeling hot about the collar to have it brought up.
	Emet-Selch knew them well enough to know that it was not out of placation, but of rage.
	Hades smiled at that.
	It gives Hades more leverage, lets him delve deeper; tongue writhing over your folds, pressing his mouth into your sex and turning his head to the side to get deeper, to angle more sharply into this one crevice, and then another.
	“Shhh, shh,” Hythlodaeus gently coaxed him to sit on the bed, relieved that he wasn’t shrugged off this time, “Emet-Selch didn’t know about… I’m sure, once they know it is the star itself, they’ll change course.” “Prometheus,” Hythlodaeus said softly, “Last night, Hades was terrified.
	I can’t ask Emet-Selch or Hythlodaeus for help, I can’t tell them.
	“For example, were She to strike you…” Hades continued, pointing directly at Ryne now who stared back at him with widened eyes.
	Emet-Selch pauses.
	“Half of us, Hades,” Azem whispered.
	Emet-Selch gently nudged at the border of his soul, concerned, apologetic.
	“Hades.
	Don’t you know better than to get in the middle of a lovers’ quarrel?” Hades said coldly.
	Emet-Selch knew he'd have to do something about them soon, but for now, Azem's current incarnation was his primary concern.
	“I’m sure he doesn’t enjoy your sour attitude,” Emilia quipped, running a palm over the machinations of Emet-Selch’s door.
	I knew Hades could feel my brooding, but didn’t say anything as I slid under the covers and curled up on my side, back facing him.
	Wringing what water he could from his hair, Hades shook and swept it over in its usual fashion, white forelock falling forward about his right eye.
	Emet-Selch observed as Mitron was quietly apologizing to a clearly fuming Azem, Loghrif coming up and gently ushering her partner away with soothing words.
	Hunger coiled within Emet-Selch and pleasure sparked in his nerve endings, burning a path through his body that started his hips bucking with want into the hand that stroked his shaft.
	Just as she remembers what Emet-Selch had said about her having attacked the healers.
	“Lady (Y/N) (L/N), ward of House Fortemps,” he announced smoothly, then bowed, and (Y/N) entered the room, leaving Hades to follow in her wake.
	“The fabric was chafing,” he purred when Hades leaned back enough to give him a  look , managing a devious smile even though he was flushed and breathless.
	Emet-Selch kept himself a few paces behind her.
	"Perfection," Emet-Selch murmurs as he watches you with hungry eyes.
	As much as Hades loved his sleep, he is always so restless when things are outside his control.
	There is a change in you, uncut and brought to life as it crawls under your skin, swims through your veins and you think that Hades must feel this too.
	Emet grasps the waves of her hair at the base of her neck and swiftly ties it with some hair tie he manifested out of nowhere.
	Hythlodaeus grasped the cords on the front of Hades’s robe, luring him closer.
	Was that Emet-Selch…?
	The question bursts from Cassia’s lips, and behind her, Emet-Selch shifts, darkness gathering around them like a protective shield.
	Hades closed his eyes at that, drifting back to sleep himself, just as the sunbeam cutting across his ceiling faded with the coming of gentle, morning rain.
	But the fact remained that… no matter how hard he tried to distract me from it, it had never been far from my mind ever since Emet-Selch had revealed that it was  not  being absorbed properly.
	Hythlodaeus had taken it upon himself to be a partner to Hades while also maintaining a hope that he could not.
	The Exarch pressed harder in response, and after a moment the edges of Emet-Selch's vision began to grow dark and hazy as a pleasant little frisson rippled through his flesh.
	Hythlodaeus believed in Hades’ dedication to their duty more than any other.
	What Emet-Selch might say.
	Not one to be left out, Emet-Selch puts his hands on Elidibus’ thighs, lowering himself to kneel between the other man’s legs, gazing upon the hard cock resting on his lower belly.
	"You know nothing," said Emet-Selch, avoiding meeting G'raha's gaze.
	But despite his words, Hades held off on the lecture.
	The result is never so pleasant as when we aggravate our poor, mewling, Hades.” They promptly curled up against Hythlodaeus’s side, faint intrigue grasping them as they watched Hades’s eager attempts to pleasure himself on Hythlodaeus’s length.
	When Hades had fallen asleep, I loosened my arms from around him, watching the skin on his face soften the deeper into sleep he went.
	Crawling over to be at his side once more, she leaned down and kissed his cheek, Hades still fast asleep.
	It does so in the most potent way, as Emet-Selch leans even closer, his hot breath brushing over your flushed skin.
	Emet-Selch’s eyes roll extravagantly.
	(Y/N) woke as Hades was unlacing her bodice, trying to undress her gently.
	“You try and unlearn a few lifetimes of habits over the course of a couple of conversations,” Emet-Selch says, his raised eyebrows matching the hint of mockery in his tone.
	Only then, hand on the door of the tower, did the Exarch look behind him to confirm Emet had truly left.
	As he made to bid the man farewell, a hand reached out and firmly grasped hold of Hades’ bicep, pulling him from beneath the tent into the fading light outside.
	“It is quite entertaining, yes,” Hythlodaeus answered with a smile, his gaze drifting back to Hades as he coiled a hand around his throat, pulling the other man back against his chest.
	A snarl rumbled in his chest as he pulled them in, his hips continuing to work the replica of Hades’s madly twitching cock.
	“We have to keep running, Hades!” Hythlodaeus was holding him against the side of a building, the screams of the dying all around him.
	“Ugh, snow.” Emet-Selch made his displeasure known.
	Okay Hades and Aestelle being so damn domestic is what I've been *dying* to write for since literally chapter one and now that we're finally here, ugh, I'm going to have so much fun writing for this disgustingly adorable couple.
	Emet stepped back, hands raised in mock surrender.
	Hades dodged as another series of blankets was tossed from the bedside of the Summoner, pillows and sheets shortly following suit.
	“As a cause of yourself,” The Exarch shot back, “We’ve little option left to us, Emet-Selch, and I feel this matter be that of our concern, not yours.” Hades stepped forward, golden eyes burning, seething in their intensity, “You of all should know the cost of traversing the rift, Exarch.
	Emet-Selch goes to raise up another, and ensures she receives most, but not all, of her predecessor’s memories.
	“I know,” Hades chuckled.
	"Oh, my dear Hades.
	The idea of  dying, the idea that they would change and be different and- something in Hades rebelled against the thought.
	Hades ignored him, greeting the headmaster with restrained courtesy and taking the seat that was offered him.
	With yet another snap from Emet-Selch, however, the Warrior of Light was soon dressed in no more than a simple tunic, and they were able to swiftly tuck her beneath the sheets.
	“Spoilsport,” Hades grumbled, then stretched out on the bed, letting himself drift to sleep with thoughts of the Warrior of Light and all the ways to find himself between her thighs - as well as all the advantage he could find there - dancing through his head.
	“Close your eyes,” Emet demanded.
	"You met me first, when both Hades and I were about to graduate from the Akadaemia," Hythlodaeus smiles at you, like he's remembering another event he's fond of.
	“No matter how long you and Emet may be away, you will always be an Amaurotine and esteemed members of the Convocation of Fourteen.
	“I dreamt that...that Emet-Selch was being judged for his deeds and that...that Hydaelyn would let him into the Lifestream under one condition- I know not what that condition was.
	Abruptly, the Exarch released him, and Emet-Selch reeled backwards gasping in momentary reprieve before the Exarch guided his mouth back down to his cock.
	“We were fully prepared to allow you a moment for yourself, after…after everything, but…well, Emet-Selch insisted we intervene.” “Apologies, Warrior of Light, but I had…” Emet-Selch paused, searching for the words.
	Hades does just that, and with such reverence to make your heart rise to your throat.
	If there is something for her to find, she’s sure Hades would have left it in his old office or possibly with their dear old friend.
	Emet-Selch released him, dropping the knife back on to the table.
	Ardbert was there when she needed someone to help her...but now he’s gone and Hades is right.
	After countless  centuries  with this man, Hades knew how to play him like a cheap fiddle.
	Emet-Selch’s arms close tightly around her, and she is about to let herself get lost in his embrace when a voice brings her back to reality.
	Emet-Selch is obviously not letting himself be discouraged and his voice turns almost mocking as he asks,  “My, was it something embarrassing perchance?” “What was your favorite thing about that play then?” Emet-Selch asks instead, and Cassia is grateful for the simple change of topics.
	Clearing his throat, Hades tears his eyes back to his material.
	They all have their own places to live but somehow they all end up crashing Hades's apartment so it's p much their home now LMAO  Hades would scoff at that and Hythlodaeus would nod but disbelieve… Prometheus, however, smiled, nodding in total agreement.
	Tis never easy to lose the ones we love.” Emet Selch slowly walked towards the group as they spoke to Runar.
	“Well then~” Hythlodaeus drawled, releasing their cock, and turning his gaze to Hades.
	The son of souls, Hades.
	“Yes, yes.” Emet-Selch waved the compliment aside, having sought none for himself in the first place.
	She glanced over at the two men who tried to give her a little privacy, Hades still rather awkward.
	He takes in the scene at a single glance; you, still bursting with aetheric Light, the Scions trapped behind the barrier and fighting to break through, and Emet-Selch with your hand clasped in both of his, the agony on his face evident as your Light flows into him.
	Emet's fingers continue to toy with the pert flesh upon your chest, and then he pulls away, resuming his circling around the pair of you.
	Even when you leave off pressure, Hades is pressed into you, lapping and licking and sucking away.
	Sighing, Hades shook his head.
	Buttons scatter to places unknown as Persephone rips Hades's shirt open, giving her free access to the expanse of his chest.
	Hades dropped kisses along the column of her throat, claiming, biting kisses.
	Feeling numb, cold, hot, feeling everything and nothing, an overwhelming sorrow, a  hatred  for these final days, their helplessness, their folly, their last hope, Emet-Selch raised his hand, eyes fixed on Azem.
	Lahabrea walked to sit on the edge of the bed opposite of her and Hades, looking down upon the two smaller individuals while Aestelle crawls to sit at her lovers’ side, her hands already holding one of his.
	As with last time, Emet-Selch made to bring me outside, though as I was on my side, he opted to scoop me into his arms.
	Using the two remaining wings still somewhat in-tact on her back, Aestelle pushed herself into the air and directly between where the cracks are forming in the aether and Hades just as Thancred broke through.
	Emet-Selch, however, remains as frowny as ever.
	Maybe she would discover more about herself that she might show Emet-Selch the next time… before she remembers just how unable she was to keep her voice down.
	Emet-Selch smiled as he watched them slip back under into slumber.
	“Still, can we really be sure of Emet-Selch’s goals?” Alphinaud posited to the group, earning a glare from his sister after she had just made the atmosphere light again.
	Hades took in a deep breath, ascending the first of the Crystal Tower’s many, winding staircases.
	“We’ll get nowhere bickering about this,” Hades said, eager himself to extract himself from this meeting.
	Only when Hades was standing over his shoulder did he glance over with mild curiosity.
	Hades is well past the time for words, communicating intent to you with a tug on the branches of your aether that jerks you forward, every point of contact burning in your awareness as they twist and turn beneath your grip.
	“That is my speciality, death traps,” Prometheus said, pressing his thumbs on either side of Hades’s spine and rubbing small, firm circles there, easing up a particularly tight knot.
	If you want something done right, Emet-Selch thought to himself, kill everyone and do it yourself.
	Finally, Emet-Selch looked up from the piece of stone still lying on the table, his hand on his chin in thought.
	Emet-Selch’s kiss gets more intense as a word sits right there at the tip of her tongue, and Cassia wonders if he, too, can taste it.
	An Elpis flower pinned to the wall over their official invitation to join the convocation, a stuffed shark from Mitron fallen to the floor, a bouquet that Emet-Selch had given them, preserved in eternal bloom tied to their headboard.
	See you how the Third stares, lost within the Underworld, unable to distinguish between barriers?” It is as he says; the Third - Hades, by his given name - stares off into the distance, his back to you, each distracted nod emphasizing the Speaker's argument.
	Emet-Selch's voice was drowned out for a moment as her own voice echoed through the air.
	Emet-Selch pressed me no further after that, his shadowed eyes still looking past me as he thought.
	Hades may say he’s fighting for Zodiark, and he is, but she knows deep down even he acknowledges how futile their plan to rejoin all the worlds truly is.
	She knows this has been a long shot, but still, when Emet-Selch slowly shakes his head, her heart sinks.
	You wouldn’t say you ever feared for your life around Hades (at least not lately) or felt he would take advantage of you (he was a considerate lover after all) but the fact remained that you were still your own person, still the Warrior of Light.
	“Nevertheless,” The Exarch murmured, scooping her into his arms and settling her on his hip, “I’d much prefer you stay within my sights.” The Exarch settled his gaze on Emet-Selch now—a gaze he could not see, but rather felt.
	The Exarch's hips rolled backwards as Emet-Selch pressed forward to meet the gesture, his own hardness grinding into the Exarch's lower back.
	Y’shtola is the first to suggest it—while Emet-Selch had been unable to forestall his own Calamity, a thousand years of knowledge would be a valuable resource indeed.
	"It is the emblem of my office, the Seat of the Architect, Emet-Selch."
	She held Hades' hand to her cheek, trying to warm him as best she could as she takes in his appearance.
	“Emet-Selch.” “Noted, Emet-Selch.
	Before she could protest or complain, Emet kissed her.
	When Emet-Selch kisses him, hands cupping his cheeks, he never tries to push down the Exarch’s hood.
	She took her time walking back to her dorm, agreeing to meet Emet an hour since he had posed his question.
	“Can we wait that long?” Hades groaned into Azem’s neck, his hardness pressing into their hip.
	Hades shook his head, and turned back to his old friend, an eyebrow raised, only to transmute to marble at the sight of the small earring, a gold, diamond-shaped stud, with a single teardrop pearl dangling from it, the companion to his own.
	If it wasn’t for Hythlodaeus and Hades and Elidibus and even the stars to offer her their comforting words and wisdom, she doesn’t know how she ever would have been able to continue on in life back then.
	As if to back up Hythlodaeus' threat, Hades' fingers glow with violet aether and trails them up her spine.
	Emet-Selch took his seat directly next to me.
	Hades had tried to wrangle for his friend to stay in his lodgings, but Hythlodaeus managed to talk him out of it.
	He will be who she saves next and she can only pray that the Twelve will see to it that she doesn’t fail him just as they ensured she wouldn’t fail Hades.
	I’d had my suspicions it wasn’t Emet-Selch himself who’d furnished the house, and his words verified it.
	Emet-Selch hummed his confirmation, lifting his arm and flicking his wrist.
	It has been well over a bell or two since Hades had disappeared with Hytholodaeus.
	First, I'm sorry if you feel I'm punished Emilia or Hades a little too much in these first two chapters, I'm a little worried about these scenes coming across that way, but...In my opinion, after the MSQ ended and these two experienced what they have, I'd imagine what would follow to be not only painful but a little bit scary.
	“Stop- teasing-” Hades mutters, unable to stop his hips from pushing back against Helios’s fingers, but all he gets for his trouble is them stilling entirely.
	But how is the hero of the hour?” Emet-Selch’s eyes traced over her.
	Not to mention, even though a mutual trust was forming between the two men—or a mutual tolerance, at the very least—the fact remained that Emet-Selch was still an Ascian, and Thancred would no doubt rather take the very rare opportunity to blend into Garlean society and gather intel using his own skills and listening with his own ears, rather than relying on the words of another.
	Of course, Hades knew all that.
	“Hades,” Elidibus says, sounding aggrieved as he reaches up to rub at his temples, “please.” “Your soul was dimming, stagnating,” Emet-Selch says, and there is anger in his voice.
	“Emet, I-“ words were softly choked out.
	“I’ll get Hades and we’ll come straight there,”  Hythlodaeus said quickly,  “Please stay safe until then!” “Just about,” Hades’s voice muttered, sounding closer.
	Hades was certain he would eventually accept the decision as the only option, anyways, eventually, even if he’d give him the cold shoulder for a while… But if it meant Prometheus survived (for his state meant he would not be involved in the summoning at all, and definitely not as an influencing sacrifice), then Hades would take it.
	Hades scoffed.
	“I wonder if we should show them what they should expect,” he said, coming to a stop next to Hades.
	This was a cruel world to be borne into, and not even Emet-Selch could immune himself from pity.
	Elidibus soon left, and Emet-Selch sighed in frustration.
	Hades stood there and looked on at her with an unreadable expression, a small wry smile dancing across his lips.
	As his voice trails off, sounding terribly empty to Cassia’s ears, Emet-Selch shakes his head.
	If she wasn’t friends with everyone in the Crystarium, he’d be surprised; they all seemed to hold her in high regard, Hades didn’t really understand why that particularly surprised him, despite her short time on the star, but it did nonetheless.
	The bond between Hades and I strained as his heartbeat picked up at the sight of the god in front of us, a myriad of feelings pouring in from him, so strong that I almost stumbled as I made my way to him.
	Perhaps you might ask Emet-Selch, as he seems to know everything.” Hythlodaeus’ eyebrow quirked up in curiosity.
	Also, if you guys are on the search for a wonderful, inclusive, and supportive Emet/FFXIV fanfic community, I urge you to come by and join this discord!
	“Did you hear that, Hades?” You ask lightly, petting his hair gently again.
	Emet-Selch’s mind is once again wide open to her, drawing her in, welcoming her home, and Cassia wonders if she could gladly spend eternity like this, just existing surrounded by nothing but love.
	Suddenly, it made perfect sense why Emet-Selch had warned her not to climax without his explicit permission, and Aeliana cursed the blinding surge of pleasure that washed over her mind when Hythlodaeus parted her folds and began stroking a finger across the throbbing bundle of nerves there.
	Emet found himself lingering toward the outskirts of the group more and more.
	Emet-Selch raised his eyebrows in approval, holding his arm out to me as if to say and there you have it, before turning his back on us all.
	Emet-Selch turns him away.
	It was pathetic with how he was going on like this, and Emet-Selch didn’t want him  vomiting  his Light all over his precious Amaurot simulacrum.
	“Oh, I…” Unwittingly, Aeliana’s mind drifted to Emet-Selch and a fist clenched around her heart.
	They thought of Emet-Selch, and clenched their eyes tight as they snapped their fingers, the memories of Zenos forefront and crystalized in their mind’s eye.
	Hades wanted to know, however, who he truly hoped would survive in the end, once fully rejoined with her shards.
	"Don't get any ideas about what this is," Emet-Selch says in a dangerously low voice, taking your chin in one gloved hand and making you face him.
	Hades, please,” she laughed.
	“Let me help you home,” Hades crooned, “I’ll give you a peaceful, dreamless sleep, if you’d let me.” He glanced at him with such intensity, that for a moment Hades was worried his friend saw through his lies - but then Prometheus just  sagged, exhaustion making his pale face drawn, as he said, “Okay.” “Good boy,” Hades murmured, carefully locking up the part of him that said this was a bad idea.
	“Tell me Hades!
	Emet-Selch sounds a little indulgent as he leans back to take a good look at you, licking his lips.
	Out of the corner of his eye, Emet-Selch could see Fandaniel’s shoulders slump, curling into himself, “I know the cost is great, but-”  There was nothing more that Emet-Selch wanted to do than cross this circle, to take Azem into his arms and reassure them, to quell the storm that was raging through their veins, to reassure them that everything would be fine, that things would be  fine  like they had done so often for himself.
	“I know you recreated Amaurot on that shard, Hades.
	"Assuming there is a next time," you pointed out, the crumpled duvet atop you suddenly more interesting than Hades’ glare.
	“While I’m aware, and thank you for the assistance, there’s a task that only you can see done at the moment.” Hades offered up the letter.
	“[Hades, I’m fine],” she responded, her hand moving to my bleeding shoulder, placing some pressure on it and I winced.
	Emet’s brief with his goodbyes to Lahabrea, the man grumbling even more so as they went to leave finally.
	Emet-Selch leaned up against the side of a ruined building, and slipped his mask off, rubbing at his eyes.
	Noticing your look, Emet-Selch looks almost gleeful, and then he moves faster than you can anticipate, and a second later, he slaps you hard enough your head snaps to the side.
	Emet-Selch, you ass!”  “Hades, I presume?”  “Hades.”  “Hades!” Hades is not proud when he presents his idea.
	Hades felt a chill settle within his stomach.
	Under most circumstances, Emet-Selch was known to be one of the most dutiful and attentive members of the Convocation of Fourteen.
	Though it appears you both simply wished to enjoy the night air, so my apologies.” The miqo’te woman said only for the younger girl’s cheeks to go red, Hades still holding her firmly by the waist and looking at Y’shtola with a bored expression.
	Wordlessly, Hades shifted, taking the sound from Hythlodaeus’s hand so he could dig his hands into Azem’s flesh, pulling them down against himself roughly.
	A sad smile pulled at the corners of her lips, “It’s fine, Emet, you don’t need to sympathize.” She cleared her throat, pushing her glasses back up on the bridge of her nose.
	There’s no way they’ll simply trust Hades because she says she does.
	If he moved away, if he breathed, Hades feared the moment would end, fragile and sweet though it was.
	“Of course, I have no way to explain to you what you are seeing,” Emet stated, “but you will have to trust me in assuring you that what you have seen is not the future.” “Yes,” Emet said.
	“Speaking of Azem,” Hythlodaeus feigned a look of sudden remembrance as he rummaged through his desk, pulling out an envelope that he slipped a piece of parchment into, before sliding it over towards Hades.
	As Emet-Selch with his skill he’s in a far better position to help her achieve her goals.
	From the Scions perspective, they've known Aestelle for years and have watched her grow and have grown alongside her to the point that even though she's explained to them her history with the Ascians and Hades, they probably haven't truly grasped the scale and reality of her situation.
	Emet-Selch,  please  .
	Hades’ gaze fell upon bright red eyes, for the first time noticing that he’d taken the chair opposite he, to the other side of the Warrior of Light.
	Your cheeks began to heat up as you realized Hades had not yet removed his hand from your face.
	Emet-Selch didn’t know how  he  did it.
	Finally clothed, G'raha affected his straightest posture and stared back at Emet-Selch.
	"Come on, Hades," she murmurs against him, "don't you want to be a daddy?"
	Hades paused for the second time that evening, “Well,” He looked back to the crack in the door then sighed, his stomach felt like ash, “You’ve my attention.” Hades swallowed, “I’m not sure I follow.” For a moment, Hades felt doubly guilty for his earlier thoughts, “Let me just say, she was different before this star, before these people touched her, helped her.
	“Insightful as ever,” Emet-Selch replies, practically pulling the thoughts from Xelinah’s mind, “Azem, as it would seem.
	“No, you won’t,” Prometheus said smugly, and it made Hades want to  actually  throw him out - preferably  out the window, “You’re all bark, no bite, Hades~” Hades levelled a heavy-lidded, unimpressed stare at his friend.
	It’s not like Hades and the others don’t deserve the hatred of her fractured friends and the rest of those living on these different stars.
	Hades and (Y/N) have a long talk, and she asks for a favor.
	With the greatest of efforts do you try to ignore the stark heat you feel under your skin, fingernails cutting fiercely into Hades’s arms as your mind is hunting—scouring to spark the synapses and seize those memories back, flashed radiant like jewels.
	He would have likely found her by now, able to see far wider and clearer than Hades can.
	Possibly (but only because I honestly did forget about Elidibus while playing through 5.0 because I was so focused on Emet and don't want to forget him here as well xD) From Innocence to G'raha to Hades, it feels as though she's breaking under the weight of the world─and in a way, she is.
	Eyes wide, a hand to his nose, Emet-Selch takes a step back, the performative edge in his voice receding.
	“  You  ?” Hades scoffed, “It can’t be called ‘being in disguise’ if no one recognises you in the first place.” Stymied by good manners, Hades and Prometheus sullenly stopped their squabbling and settled in for mandatory pleasantries.
	“Mm,” I hummed, looking back up to where Hades, Lahabrea, and Hythlodaeus were gathered, smiles on their faces as they joked around about the old days in Amaurot.
	Those prehistoric believers incorrectly assumed the star they lived on to be a  living creature,  and while Hades agreed the planet was to be respected and cared for, elevating it to the level of a god and performing meaningless rituals to its name was a step too far.
	He was always there for her when she needed another opinion on something she knew Hades and Hythlodaeus would be biased towards.
	“Once Emet is awake and we’ve started looking into how to get you all back home where you belong I’ll rest.” Just, promise me no more using the white auracite against Emet or Elidibus.
	“Hades, hand me that,” Hythlodaeus ordered, voice thick with lust as he indicated the nearby box with one hand.
	Hades has no answer for that.
	“Hrm,” Hades pulled back a fraction, while Prometheus stood there in a happy kind of daze, his nose gently bumping against his, “Now  that  was an interesting noise.” "Shush,” Prometheus huffed, sliding his hands higher up Hades’s chest, until he could wrap his arm around his shoulders and keep him close - just in case he had any ideas to be a tease and move away.
	“Although you may not know my exact motives, surely you can surmise, at this point, that it is not to kill you and yours?” Emet-Selch implored, as if searching for a shred of intelligence in the room.
	Emet's spell lasts longer than he meant and the Exarch dreams of a new (old?)
	“You’re forgetting that Emet needs you more.” Ardbert cut her off.
	“Have you figured it out, Emet-Selch?
	Saving Hades and Elidibus will save the First and stop the Eighth Umbral Calamity.
	I can’t imagine how hard it was to go up against Elidibus and I won’t even pretend to know what kind of hell you’ve been dealing with internally since you killed Emet.
	A void portal opened next to me and Hades stepped through.
	He felt self-conscious, despite Hades and Hythlodaeus not being judgemental.
	You lay there quietly with him for long minutes, content to allow this sore and aching mortal vessel of yours to soak out its pains in the wonderful caressing heat; not being currently possessed of one himself, you can’t help but wonder what Emet-Selch gets out of the activity besides an opportunity to hold you with your naked body pressed slick against his -- but he must know that he could do that anywhere.
	Emet-Selch gave a glance at the timepiece on the wall.
	Emet looks down at you, lips kiss bruised, and hair wild with sweat.
	Instead the spell had almost struck true, killing his physical body and dealing a glancing blow so severe to his soul Hades still felt a dull ache from the memory alone.
	Hades made a beeline for his private quarters, no doubt able to sense the absolute beacon of  intense anxiety  that was Prometheus.
	He drives off without another word and Emet turns to look at her, searching for certainty.
	“You know, it seems stupidly simple,” Prometheus continued, undeterred by Hades’s distraction, “But I wouldn’t have thought of it if you asked me to make a building that can cool itself.” “Knowing you, you would line the walls with ice crystals and call it a day,” Hades muttered.
	Hades came to stand in front of me as I hoisted my bag onto my back.
	“There you are, Hades,” Hythlodaeus remarked, a dangerous lilt to his voice.
	Hades could feel his breath returning to him, grounding him back to reality.
	“Pray...I test something, Exarch?” Emet asked.
	Hades swayed lazily at the hip bump, slouching exaggeratedly, “No.” “Excuse me,  I’m  the brat?” Hades huffed, “You tried to suffocate me in a headlock not even five minutes ago.” “Um,” Icarus interrupted before Prometheus could launch himself at Hades, “Should I excuse myself, or…?” Prometheus shot Hades a glare that practically screamed ‘I’ll get you later’  before turning to Icarus with an insincere smile, “Oh, no, it’s fine.
	Hades couldn’t help but smile when Prometheus’s soul bubbled with pure happiness and pride at that.
	Once he’s cleaned most of the blood from her, Emet-Selch begins bandaging her remaining wounds.
	Hades stopped in the doorway, rocking back on his heels and staring; Hythlodaeus had no such reservations, feet carrying him forward until he stopped next to the bed, where the young traveler was propped up by a generous number of pillows.
	Distantly, beyond the noise of rain, Hades heard thunder rumble overhead.
	“Chose…” A toneless, brittle laugh falls from Emet-Selch’s lips.
	His biting words when he mentioned that Emet-Selch had touched me.
	Of course Thancred would, with his hot temper, make quick, rash decisions, especially when it had to do with Emet-Selch.
	"You won’t find any,”  comes Emet-Selch’s reply.
	Emet-Selch’s jaw twitched.
	“That’s…a bit much, isn’t it?” Hades asked carefully despite how his cock ached to feel such sensations again.
	“Emet-Selch speaks the truth.
	Letting all of his pent-up emotions out, Emet-Selch was mildly horrified at the degree of emotion slipping into his voice.
	He pressed his forehead against Hades.
	“Hades?” “Her soul, sundered as it is, looks entirely normal,” says Emet-Selch, leaving you to wonder why such a thing had evidently been in doubt.
	Though it’s weakened compared to what I…should be able to imbue, it acts well enough for this purpose.” Emet grunted as he shifted towards her, holding out his arm with the support of his left forearm.
	Hades shuddered, his mind fuzzing in answer to soft heat running along his length—but not allowing him entry.
	Emet-Selch raises an eyebrow.
	“Because you are an idiot, it seems,” Hades said, gently bopping Hythlodaeus on the forehead before he stood.
	Emet has saved both Y’shtola and Alisaie, and I for one want to show him all of the wonderful things us sundered are capable of!
	“It is merely that you are… so very alike to one we once knew, and Hades spent decades at her side.
	“Oh?” Hades quirks an eyebrow.
	“It is true that I did not offer up the whole truth, but I did not lie.” Hades scoffed.
	When my knees buckled, I grabbed ahold of Hades’ arm to keep from falling.
	“It  is  , but it’s too much, Hades.
	Which meant, all this time, Hades had known and  didn’t say anything!
	Quite suddenly, something firmly grasps onto your hand at your side and it is embarrassing to note how long it takes for you to determine that it is Emet-Selch’s hand.
	You’re sure he doesn’t actually let it show, but you can feel Hades’s urge to grin when he catches your movement.
	That holy blood runs in their veins, and perhaps something in G’raha—something primal, ferocity incarnate—kindles to that, because it’s a different sort of war in Hades’ bed.
	Once Emet is awake again, I’ll speak with him on what he thinks we should do.
	of Hades’s tentacles.
	“Hades, I thought we—” Hades snapped his fingers, and she blinked out of sight, teleporting her back to where her friends were, where she would no doubt regain her senses as the Warrior of Light once she was away from here.
	His mask hid his expression, and when Hades prodded his soul’s borders, he was, unusually, kept out, “Probably because I stayed up late last night.
	The ears that’d been flat against her skull now rose high on her head, twitching, acting almost like bumpers on either side of his hand as he moved his fingers back and forth vigorously, “I…W-wait,” Her face was now colored back to that same, flustered red, “E-Emet!” Hades smirked and began to walk, looking back over his shoulder, “There’s many a thing you don’t know about me, hero, and I shall ever pride myself on that.” Also, if you guys are on the search for a wonderful, inclusive, and supportive Emet/FFXIV fanfic community, I urge you to come by and join this discord!
	Throwing her for a loop, Emet-Selch steps closer before unceremoniously sitting down next to her.
	This reunion was for no one but (Y/N) and Hades.
	But, Hades couldn’t.
	"Well, given her fondness of us..." Emet purrs.
	Hades does not reject it.
	You sound a lot more steady than you anticipated, and in front of you, Emet-Selch smiles.
	But she is interested in potentially watching Emet-Selch teach, watching him in his daily life as a normal person.
	Prometheus was still curled up against him, his face hidden, his soul inscrutable - small, walled off, even to him, unnerved - and Hades was… uncertain.
	Azem obeyed as they stifled a yawn, but Hades less so.
	“Hades.” The acknowledgement is short, simple, and utterly bereft of its normal warmth.
	“There we go,” Hades hummed, a dark surge of satisfaction rippling through his soul, “Was that so hard?” Hades jerked him off, hard and fast, and Prometheus’s threat broke off into a mess of panting moans, twitching and squirming as the pleasure  piqued- and it fucking  piqued, the orgasm  so intense  Prometheus was fairly certain he blacked out for a good second there.
	Emet-Selch has no need for such tact.
	Hades shot out his hand, preventing her from closing the door further as she looked up at him with quiet curiosity.
	Hythlodaeus’s moans are among the sweetest sounds Hades has ever heard - he drinks them in like a man starving, and finds he wants more.
	“Our existences may not be the most extraordinary in the grand scope of this sundered world’s history, but it is Emet’s wish that this city was created to act as a living memory for you to ever find a home in─and we are but an extension of that wish.
	“I said I’d come after my work was finished, and so here I am.” Hades shrugged and began looking over the remaining food, trying to decipher what exactly the spread was.
	The expression on your face must have been one of pure bewilderment, as Hades sighed, slouching forward.
	Hades set his jaw, breathing deep the scent of her.
	My name, my name is Hades,” Emet-Selch spoke, and the Exarch realized there was no lie in his words.
	At least Emet-Selch is willing to-” Hades was dealing with it by denying that she was truly the real Azem, truly the woman both of them had loved so dearly that her death broke them into pieces, but him?
	"Emet-Selch," Elidibus starts once again.
	She would be okay, “I hath freed the bindings I’d placed upon this one,” Hades watched as the Oracle stopped before him, gesturing down for the others in the room.
	Of course Emet-Selch could play his grandson like a violin and doing that helped him feel a little better.
	The Garlean emperor, first of his name, a member of the Convocation, Emet-Selch, the Architect, no less, was playing the role of the servant.
	“Feels good, doesn’t it?” Emet-Selch purrs in Elidibus’ ear.
	“Fiiine,” Azem whined, turning their frustrations to Hades’s toy—just as Hythlodaeus planned.
	Also ooooooo Hades and Aestelle starting to get angsty :3 I have no regrets with the angst that's about to come our way.
	“Well, I for one would not mind suffering Emet-Selch’s company.
	His ‘true form’ lacked physical eyes, but his Sight was sharper than ever, picking out the calm, muted ripples that made up Hades’s soul - dark colours, swirling like rustling leaves in dim shadows.
	Hades sitting on the grass, his hand resting on his arm, the both of them sinking deep into one another.
	“Emet is the only person who can help me.
	It didn’t help that he could see Hades over Hythlodaeus’s shoulder, smirking at him.
	Everything feels so long ago after she nearly lost herself to her grief when she remembered all that Hades had asked her to.
	Emet-Selch appeared above the crumbling shack near the beach, scowling down at it.
	Hades swallowed, a hard lump forming in the back of his throat, “And what did you show her?” Hades’ head jerked back up, brow furrowed in confusion.
	Clutching the towel tightly above your breasts, you slip from the bed and move to join Emet-Selch, wrapping your arms around the still-hesitating Emissary; Elidibus is caught between the two of you, and with his body pressed against yours, you  feel  as much as hear his soft sigh.
	A system of ice-aspected wind crystals would suffice well enough as a method to keep the building cool, but working with elemental crystals was a pain and Hades was, first and foremost, an architect.
	Please, Emet-Selch.
	Knowing full well that the Eternal Bond had gone dormant in the wake of Zodiark’s summoning, I still silently begged Hades to stay safe.
	“And it seems you can as well,” Hades snapped.
	Hades pulled her closer, bringing his arm out from beneath the pillow to hug her to his chest, and buried his face in the curve of her neck.
	You grew up in a city with no connections to magick, no disputes with nearby towns, and was generally loved by all.” Hades' expression fell into a scowl.
	“So,” Prometheus said, knocking Hades’ out of his half-formed calculations, “This is  strictly  a prototype, but if it passes approval than it can be seeded in the tropical swamps down south.” “It hasn’t even been  approved  yet, and you’re showing me?” Hades said, disbelieving.
	“You have ever been a champion for our cause, Emet-Selch.
	(Y/N) belongs to Hades, and Hades to (Y/N).
	Emet-Selch blinked hard and looked down.
	That gave Hades pause; he knew she had the sight, but surely not enough to see the colors his thoughts had turned his soul… At least, no, she was mortal, surely she couldn’t see that minute change, not in a soul as dense as his own.
	Emet-Selch shakes his head.
	I glanced sidelong as Emet-Selch, crossing my arms over my chest as the others began filing out to prepare for the journey.
	Emet-Selch doesn’t sound kind when he tells her to stop casting in the middle of a complex array of spells.
	Your knees inadvertently attempt to shut tight as your back bows to the sensation, choking on air and jerking your shoulders at the bindings when Hades circles his lips along that bud and suckles slowly, with such leisure.
	Her beloved Hades finally holding and kissing and caring for her as she always wanted him to from the moment she learned the truth of their history and fate.
	“Not that I am not mad you didn’t tell me it was Emet-Selch of all people who wrote you these letters, I absolutely am, but you look like you’ve been to several hells and back.” Carefully, Adriene wipes a few stray tears from Cassia’s face.
	Your Hades, always such a compassionate creature.
	Hades wasn’t an early riser, got grumpier the lower the sun was when he woke, but  sometimes, rarely, he woke up before Prometheus and looked at him and  felt… Will continue to feel them, with the endless centuries to come, and once more Hades counted himself lucky, to find his other half so early in life, to enjoy being whole for the rest of eternity.
	The climax of the piece came and went, Emet pulling much of the weight as the main part of the duet.
	Raha can’t resist pumping, once, twice, before finding himself and dragging his hand—the crystal one, gilded fractures glimmering in the candelight—up the corpse-like cold of Hades’ chest.
	Emet-Selch's eyes never left the Exarch's face, though his own remained fixed in an expression of polite, detached amusement, concealing the acerbic stab of want that flooded his veins.
	About the Architect, Emet-Selch.
	With gray streaked hair framing his sharp jaw and slender neck, Emet-Selch is an all too familiar creature.
	She sat and wept and twisted the ring on her finger and wrote that for you.” Every word was an arrow to Hades’s heart.
	Taking one step then two, she started up the stairs once more just as Hades opened a portal into the rift to his right.
	Emet-Selch looks you in the eye and squeezes your arm – just hard enough to get a yelp, to see the pain flash in your eyes, piercing him just as surely.
	After Hades had disappeared in a cloud of purple smoke, I tried to keep myself occupied.
	Emet-Selch smirked at him, so close and yet not touching, not even moving anymore, except for his eyes to rove over the Warrior, looking deeper than his flesh.
	It was already venting the excess aether, putting things to rights after being helped along by Hades and Hythlodaeus’s healing spells.
	“Then go back to sleep, if you like,” Hythlodaeus suggested deviously from where he sat with his back against the headboard, Hades perched in his lap.
	Emet-Selch is no small foe, and even if he knows every move the Ascian will make— Emet-Selch is a man of easy smiles and quick boredom, whose presence the Exarch grows used to in much the same way one does an ill-fitting seam.
	As he stared up, Hades was homesick, too.
	I refrained from mentioning how I had met myself in the past, as it didn't seem like crucial information to the situation at hand, but somehow I felt as if he had seen it anyway.Emet-Selch’s eyes moved rapidly behind their lids as I recalled the memories once more for his sake, hopefully drawing enough of whatever residual aether he needed in order to see what I had.Soon after I finished talking, I felt his aether retreat from my own, and his eyes shot open in anger.“How could Hermes have been such a fool?” he growled, as furious as if the events had only just transpired moments before.
	“If you think I am not a woman of my word…” Cassia starts, but Emet-Selch only shoots her an amused look.
	What a weird turn of events─Elidibus, Lahabrea, and Hades all playing a part in the Garlean Empire at one point or another.
	Hades’ brows knit together.
	I imagine it must be, as its been blooming in Elpis for some time it would seem.” Emet-Selch answers.
	As ever, the Hero proves stubbornly unmoving; the man now known as Emet-Selch sighs.
	“Hades,” she whispered, and something in her voice caught on his heart, and he turned all his attention to her.
	“Hmph, how could I not?” Emet-Selch threw his arms up in nonchalance.
	You’re  sorry?” Hades asked incredulously.
	With no singular concept embodying such ideal traits and with breeding long deemed unnecessary, it was quickly decided that Hades will create the unique addition to your family, one that might accompany you on the professional outings demanded by your position.
	That sense of unpredictability was back, Hades clenching his hands as his friend tilted his head at him, like a predator trying to decide whether to go for the belly or the throat.
	To save Hades and Elidibus she should listen to Ardbert and only tell them what they need to know for the time being.
	She vividly remembers the sense of relief that had run through her when she had first talked to Emet-Selch, and he had more or less confirmed her doubts about the Twelve.
	Emet-Selch cut him off, “Where are they now?” he demanded.
	Sometimes, Emet-Selch  swore  he could see a glimmer of  knowledge  in him.
	Hades looked over to the Summoner, caught off guard by his admittance.
	Emet, I mean.
	“It is not,” Emet-Selch says dryly, “considered wise to venture into Hydaelyn’s own nest on that plane.
	With a sigh, Hades averted his gaze to himself.
	“And if there’s anything historians make sure to hand down, it’s tales of legendary powers, and as far as mages go there are few greater than Hades and his masterful command over the power of the Underworld.
	“Don’t hurt them!” She said, quickly moving to stand in front of Hades.
	True, the Warrior lacked the context to use what they now knew to any particularly deleterious end, but their uncertainty was a variable that was not under Emet-Selch's control and that awareness wormed its way into him like a thorn, thickening his blood with that poison called hope.
	Droids tended to develop erratic personalities and behaviours if you got too convoluted, so Prometheus programmed certain things like: ‘  any who use the Force are Jedi’  , and  ‘do not attack any sentients who are still considered Younglings’  and  ‘Priority Target: Jedi Master Hades Galvus’  .
	“Try not to be coy,” Emet-Selch sighed, “It’s obvious your Echo granted you a vision of some kind.
	When Hythlodaeus was gone and returned to his mission, Emet-Selch was stuck with his thoughts.
	“Emet-Selch…” she starts, only to get interrupted by him immediately.
	Hades  ?
	“The Light is dangerous all on its own, my dear,” Emet-Selch says with a solemn look.
	Hades bristled.
	Emet-Selch resented how light he felt at that confession, how the words caused a sudden fluttering feeling in his heart and stomach.
	Hands slid up G'raha's back, and as Emet-Selch bent himself to his unraveling he grasped the back of the collar and yanked it tight against his throat.
	“Thank you for your esteemed wisdom oh honorable Emet-Selch.” Not to mention Hythlodaeus isn’t here to mediate or placate Emet-Selch.
	Hades has taken on an impossible burden to carry alone and yet she’s positive he has never once complained.
	When I arrived, exhausted, depressed, and still in yesterday’s clothes, almost everyone else was there already, but Emet-Selch came in behind me.
	Hades has a remarkable talent for planning and plotting and manipulating, getting every piece just exactly into position, controlling how events play out perfectly, cornering his opponent quite thoroughly… only for it to all fall down around him in the worst way possible.
	Emet-Selch shrugs off his coat, taking off his gloves with his teeth finger-by-finger—gods help you, your insides clenched deliciously as you watched—before casting them aside and stripping down to merely his smalls.
	Emet-Selch grabbed their face and pulled back.
	“Oh, yes,” says Emet-Selch immediately.
	“I understand why Hades and the others wanted to bring them back, and Zodiarks’ tempering only made the desire far more impossible to ignore, but I could never condone the intentional loss of life on such a grand scale for a third time to come.
	The silver haired man only shook his head, surprising Emet-Selch in the fact that he did not deny his claims about their losses not being equal, but merely pressed on with his original point.
	She turned around fully just in time for Hades to bend down and wrap her up in a tight embrace, his hold on her deathly tight to the point his embrace hurts.
	Emet-Selch seemed to be limiting his time more graciously.
	A not altogether uncomfortable silence cascaded over the room this time as they quietly drank the rest of their respective drinks, and seeing the bottle in its near-empty state made Emet-Selch seriously consider conjuring a new one.
	Hades pauses a moment, then purses his lips over your clit and sucks hard.
	It was obvious Hades was suffering, and though you did not understand the niceties of his situation, you were unwilling to leave him to carry his burdens alone.
	Hades had to admit, he was beginning to wonder if this was a common thing she’d do when she was angry—he couldn’t remember the hero doing it as much before.
	Their caught Emet-Selchs gaze in a flash of amber.
	“I look forward to it,” Emet-Selch says, his voice low and suggestive, and then he laughs softly when a loud yawn punctuates the silence -- yours.
	Prometheus’s soul shivered, but it didn’t shy away from Hades’s touch, “No… well, maybe.” Hades raised an eyebrow at him.
	Hades gives a bitter laugh himself, gazing at you from beneath is lashes.
	Emet-Selch frowns giving him a sudden sharp look.
	Even though you nearly jump at the sensation – Hyth is watching, he can see your every movement, hear you whine softly as Hades draws his tongue back too fast – it’s time to assert yourself.
	Emet-Selch immediately scoffed at her words.
	I nodded my head in their direction and Hades turned to face them.
	On either side of him, his agemates Hythlodaeus and Hades were sprawled out in equal states of bliss.
	His light lilac purple eyes caught her attention first, such a stark contrast to Hades’ pale golden ones.
	“I like that idea.” She said, shocking her friends and Hades and even herself to some degree.
	Lahabrea seemed to notice it too, tearing it from Hades’ hand, but nearly immediately dropped it to the ground, moving to grab ahold of his friend’s face, forcing him to focus.
	Hades watched on as she grinned up to the hero, showing off the crops she’d harvested from just this tree alone.
	You make your Hades cry and sob and beg for you, and then you take his pretty, pretty eyes, and you drag him before Him, make him look at his god who is yours, too.
	I think Emet would like that one what with being some drama enthusiast and all.” Aestelle stood tall, Hades’ eyes going wide as she looks at him.
	Emet-Selch is right there in front of her, looking exactly as she remembers him best.
	You created a habit of visiting Amaurot: assuming you had the time to do so, you would teleport there in the evening, explore a bit, try to talk to shades you had not yet heard from, and finally slept in what you assumed was Hades’ old residence, or a faithful copy of it, at least.
	Emet-Selch leans over him, says, “I am asking.” Visible only to the Exarch, the Ascian half-smiles, reaches up and slides his mask to the level of his eyebrows.
	Subconsciously, without knowing or understanding those things, but he remembered  just enough  for Emet-Selch to find himself faltering sometimes.
	I could have had you a dozen times.” Hades sank his teeth into her shoulder.
	Elidibus had seen plenty of Amaurotines die of heartache, after Zodiark’s ascension, to recognise the beginning of it in Emet-Selch.
	But thinking about Y’shtola reminds her of what the miqo’te woman had said following her battle with Hades.
	“Hades, please,” I said, my impatience making itself known.
	“Why is everyone…” he started, before his eyes fell upon Emet.
	The Exarch rose to his knees, fumbling with the front of his robes and withdrawing his half-hard cock with one hand as the other tangled itself in Emet-Selch's hair.
	"Lahabrea," He says, more an observation than a greeting, voice hoarse and rough with want (not need, Emet-Selch does not need) in a way that surprises even him.
	Hades froze.
	Hades sighed in the most put upon manner possible, making Prometheus roll his eyes, but he obediently rested his hands slightly above his head, giving him a ‘well, go on’ look.
	“How poetic,” Emet-Selch drawls, chin coming to rest on Elidibus’ shoulder.
	Scowling, Emet-Selch snatched the grape from their hand.
	And one Emet-Selch, watching them with an indescribable ache inside of him, threatening to tear him apart at the seams as he watched a shallow replica, a washed-out, hollow mockery of the one he loved so dearly move in the shadow of their footsteps.
	Emet-Selch scoffs.
	Emet watched Aletheia in unabashed fashion, noting that she was struggling as she flipped between the third and fourth page.
	Hades felt a shiver of unease at the sight.
	They were activities the Warrior of Light was already inclined to do, regardless, which only made Emet-Selch wonder.
	Emet-Selch drifts from conversation to conversation, safe in his anonymity as he listens to the unfiltered opinions of his guests.
	You know Emet-Selch is just using it as an excuse to take advantage and compose himself.
	Before you can get a word in edgewise, both Emet-Selch and Hythlodaeus are gone.
	Considering this had been  under the sea  for possibly eons, Aza had a suspicion this was Emet-Selch’s doing.
	“That, I can relate to.” Hades realized he was becoming a romantic and hated it.
	A few minutes after they had finished, Hades left a soft kiss on my lips and departed for the meeting.
	“Please,” You plead, “Emet-Selch.
	Hades is suffocating me!
	Hades, who was always so close to him, who could read him better than himself most days...
	After you spend the night with Emet-Selch morning comes to the Greatwood, and with it a few surprises.
	Are you going to apologize for waking them, and without any prompting from me?” Hythlodaeus remarked, resting a hand on Hades’s rump before looking to Azem.
	With a hard jolt, Emilia snapped from the ground, shoving the kind hands from her shoulders with a force Hades felt could nearly break his wrists.
	Emet smirks triumphantly before turning to leave.
	Something on your face must give a bit of it away because Hyth’s lips are twitching and between that twitch and the twitch of Hades in your grasp – the clear arousal and wet, dewy desire dripping off him – you’re just about ready to slam the door in his face and teach Hades a lesson.
	Hades just hopes that this time around, all of you can enjoy life to the fullest, together, at least once.
	Just how devastating would her blow be to Hades’ soul if she were to truly try and save him..?
	Between venturing out into the Empty and accompanying Y'shtola into the depths of the Ronkan ruins, many days I was successful in keeping Hades off of my mind.
	“You’re  freezing  ,” Hades snapped, and he grabbed Prometheus by his biceps, forcing him to sit up.
	Hythlodaeus leans forward with interest while Emet-Selch raises an eyebrow yet again.
	Prometheus found himself starting to smile, his nerves settling when he realised he hadn’t ruined anything, that Hades actually  returned  those feelings.
	Hades tuned the order out, already mentally supplanting whatever nonsense coming out of the customer’s mouth with ‘decaff espresso’ as his gaze slid over to the far corner of the coffee shop.
	As she began to finally pull away, Hades could feel her breath hot on his face, his mixing in with her own.
	“All or nothing, Hades.” “Hades -” She cuts herself off, purses her lips.
	“I am never letting you out of my sight again….never letting you cross through doors I cannot follow you through,” Emet whispered.
	The room erupted in deafening applause and I felt a tug on the tether, Hades urging me to stand with him.
	“Find yourself, did you?” Emet-Selch asks.
	Hythlodaeus would have stopped by, written his name on Emet-Selch’s face in ink, and put a blanket around his shoulders.
	The real Solus had looked forward to their union and Emet-Selch, over the ages, had become a talented actor.
	When he sees how obviously he has flustered you, Emet-Selch's smile widens.
	You may have bested me on the First, but that was when I thought I could not have you.” Hades dipped his head, catching her earlobe in his teeth and giving it a gentle tug.
	Emet-Selch only frowned, having bent down beside me once more, though soon returned to his feet with a forced glibness to his demeaner that made me hasten to compose my own.
	Even prior to this, as the emperor, as a legatus, as a sorcerer, Emet knew well enough that dispelling an ounce of the truth to anyone was a heavy price to pay in the certain future.
	“You managed to evade every attack but one and this is the result?” Hades sighed.
	Hades couldn’t help the mocking smile that slipped onto his face, nearly at a loss for words at her utterly uninspired retelling.
	He crumpled, stunned, and blinked dazedly; the light from distant fires was so dim he could only make out a silhouette that he recognized as Emet-Selch's -- until it wasn't, until glistening, fleshy tendrils had wound around G'raha's limbs, unyielding in their strength.
	Her mask shattered upon the floor, her soul blazing with vehement rage, at him, at Hades, her friends.
	With Emet-Selch’s mask lifted, the Exarch takes hold of the base of his own hood to keep it over his face, and lifts his chin.
	When he was alone in his rooms, sometimes Hades would catch himself jotting down little notes from their conversations in the corners of his scrolls, or on scraps of old papers.
	It took Hades the rest of his evening to fix his lightsaber.
	“Oh thank Zodiark,” Hades replied, reaching for it.
	Hades continued to play, focusing on the keys, the touch of his gloved hands as soft as the song itself, and he did not look at her.
	While it is true that you have not regained your full memories, I can no longer deny that when I look at you, it is Azem I see before me.” Emet-Selch took a weary sigh before he continued, and I could tell I wasn’t going to like what I heard next.
	Hades stopped struggling with a sulky mutter, wishing he just went back to sleep.
	“Hades…!” I could hear Hythlodaeus’ panicked tone as he called my name, but it slowly faded away, replaced with the soothing voice beckoning me to sleep, to dream of the past, to relive my memories of happier, less complicated times.
	Sees Hades -  truly  Hades, stripped of the fascinations of emperor and primal servant both, triumphant.
	“Emet,” she begged softly, knowing not what to ask, only wanting to say his name for good measure, and she dropped to the base once more.
	“How fares Lahabrea?” Emet-Selch asked.
	For the second time in what was definitely not a long enough amount of time, you found yourself wondering if you were perhaps willingly throwing yourself into the maws of a hungry beast; a plan orchestrated by Emet-Selch or Elidibus should either one fall to the Warrior of Light.
	“I understand that it must be frightening for you,” Elidibus murmured, and in his peripheral Prometheus saw him shoot Hades a warning look, “But know that our God holds no grudge against you for denying Him.
	The sound of the study room’s door all but slamming open uncharitably rips Hades out of his concentration, and he instinctively scrambles for his mask- only to stop and sigh as he regards the man coming in.
	“Please…” Hades shuddered as Hythlodaeus’s fingers traced down his abdomen.
	Emet-Selch clears his throat.
	Emet caught her by surprise, holding her hand up to his lips and placing a gentle kiss to it for one last bow.
	Smiling still, Hades slowly gives in to his rest, knowing that when the time comes, he’ll wake and the most important people to him will be there beside him to journey on.
	But what did Emet-Selch expect?
	Hades scowled, looking down at them himself.
	“Emet-Selch, Warrior of Light,” Gaia said with intensity and abundant confidence, without looking at us.
	Who hasn’t?” He pulled out another infant, and dumped it on Hades’s lap.
	Hades thought smugly, while his men stared in mute horror that someone could get through their Emperor’s proven shield.
	“Sleep this off,” Hades said, “Hythlodaeus and I will clean up your mess.” It was going to be messy, backbreaking work to empty out the contaminated Lifestream and scrub it clean, and here Hythlodaeus and Hades were doing it without really hesitating.
	It was a power Hades hadn’t tapped into since that fateful day when the world split into fourteen shards, when he and Zodiark’s other disciples had fought Prometheus into a corner he couldn’t escape.
	Emet-Selch had kept his word to the letter.
	"Hades, be a dear and fuck her throat."
	Hythlodeus jumped back, a stumble into Emet-Selch who managed to catch him.
	Emet clearly changed and began to truly view us sundered as life worth investing in!
	He chokes on the word as Emet-Selch’s fist smashes into his cheek.
	Even in his sleep, Emet-Selch holds her tightly against him, and Cassia is struck by the feeling of how much she yearns for this moment to never end.
	“Are you still departing for the outer regions tomorrow?” Hades asked idly, and his soul felt like the soft pawprints of a cat walking up and down his spine, showing none of the irritation Prometheus had felt outside.
	Emet-Selch's voice is laced with amusement as he lets his fingers trail up the back of your neck and into your lose hair.
	“So Hades has left for the Tempest with G’raha, and Light has returned to all of Novrandt because of me.
	I am not as young as I used to be and the thought of wearing armor again is tiring on it’s own.” She sighed, shaking her head before shifting her gaze to the large bed Hades is currently sleeping in.
	Ah, yes, the esteemed Emet-Selch is busy nursing his cock about now – ” Hades bangs his head against the tub.
	“Mm, you know, for some reason I do.” Both a puppet and the puppet master’s assistant, she set out to find Emet-Selch a few yalms up ahead.
	The announcement came from the chancellor, bellowing his excitement for the esteemed Emet Selch that would soon grace the halls of the concert.
	Your Hades does so love to play games.
	“And I you,” he says back to her, a sparkle in his eyes that Emet-Selch has never seen before.
	Emet-Selch slouched further, clearly annoyed they were rushing his theatrics.
	“You won’t?” Her voice is just as quiet, and Emet feels the ache in his core grow twofold at the mere innocence of her question.
	Unlike Thancred and Urianger who were most definitely at the forefront of the plan to carry on with killing Hades, G’raha seemed reluctant to follow suit.
	"Absolutely not," Lahabrea says bluntly, stepping around Emet-Selch to deposit a file on his desk, "And don't sulk, Emet-Selch, I am  busy.
	I told you, (Y/N), I take very good care of my things.” Hades slid a finger inside her, and she cried out - louder when he added a second finger.
	Emet was standing to the side, hand to his mouth, eyes closed.
	“Yes,” Aeliana accepted his terms without hesitation in a hoarse whisper that revealed her utter desperation and behind her, Emet-Selch smirked.
	“And allow Emet-Selch time to rest.” As if in response, Emet-Selch’s arm tightened around my waist, holding me firmly to him.
	Emet-Selch leaned forward from his resting pose against the wall, tilting his head at me as he smiled.
	Emet-Selch will take to the air, Hythlodaeus will be on the ground.
	“Hades!
	Emet-Selch cannot believe you go there willingly.
	A chorus of exasperated groans echoed throughout the Ocular as Emet-Selch continued to look innocently on, and G’raha tapped his staff on the floor twice, attempting to regain civility.
	Hades looked over his shoulder at me, shaking his head nearly imperceptibly, then summoned his crystalline staff to his hand and turned back to the other Ascian.
	Walk forward with your head held high, and do keep Emet from dragging everyone down into his ocean of never-ending sadness.
	My gaze slid up to Emet-Selch to see his reaction.
	“Oh…” Prometheus was panting when Hades leaned back against his pillows, his face a bright shade of red, “That felt nice.” “Masochist,” Hades murmured, “Was that hard enough?” Hades hummed, and his friend shifted, adjusting his position until his head rested against Hades’s chest instead, gently nuzzling against him.
	Oh, my darling, Hades thought, staring at her with open longing, I will make you a legend, tonight.
	Hades, my dearest Hades...it feels as if I have lived through a dream.
	“I…am sorry, hero,” Hades whispered, looking for her eyes.
	“I loath to say it, but Emet-Selch is right.
	Hades could see that something had snapped in their hero, something that’d been holding their Champion together, soul and mind.
	Emet-Selch has made it clear to you how little he thinks of the “pleasures of the flesh”, despite indulging in them.
	“You underestimate me, love,” Emet-Selch says, amusement swinging in his voice.
	Emet smiled broadly at her, clearly glad that she asked the question in favor of taking up his offer.
	Hades looked down at her, eyebrow raised again with an equal, confident smirk.
	It must end, just-', Hades didn't even need to finish the thought.
	To keep him under both his and Hades’s watchful eye while the city burned around them.
	“I love you,” He says, and as he says it, Emet-Selch realizes it’s the first thing he’s said aloud to you since he’s brought you here.
	Hydaelyn and Zodiark, a glimmering city he once called home, the Ascians… the Ascians were well-chronicled in the tales of the Warrior of Light’s adventures, and Emet-Selch filled in all the necessary gaps to paint a cohesive picture.
	Emet-Selch looks utterly composed, but Cassia can feel from the tension and the insistence of his aether that he is far more impacted by all of this than he gives away.
	Hades took the first one that had been written in Zenos’ personal hand, not that of a secretary, and read it.
	Waiting at the designated location, Aestelle couldn’t help but glance around while she waited for her friends and Hades to arrive.
	“We won’t force you.” Hades reached behind me, wrapping his arm around my shoulders and I settled into him.
	This time  both  their brows raise before Emet-Selch gives you a tiny smirk.
	Hades will wake up...he has to.
	“Ow,” Hades grunted, before letting out a huffy kind of laugh, his lips briefly finding Prometheus’s in a fleeting kiss before he leaned back a fraction, “You get very clumsy when nervous, mm?” “Shut up,” Prometheus muttered, aware he was red-faced and mortified, but he tightened his grip on the front of Hades’s robes, refusing to let him move any further away, “You- that kiss was out of nowhere!
	Implied Emet/Exarch if that's your thing Emet-Selch drags a careless hand across his shoulders, slinking forward into his vision.
	Hades was still blanketing him, keeping the worst of Amaurot’s din out, his hand on his shoulder.
	It’s okay, he’s had his fun... and also Hades might very well follow through with that drowning threat.
	Muffled by the tendril working his throat, all Hades could do was whimper with pleasure as Hythlodaeus and his tendrils swiftly brought him to climax, his mind going fuzzy as the myriad sensations threatened to overwhelm him, the murmured praise from his partner sending shivers through his very soul.
	He placed a kiss on Hades's cheek.
	Emet-Selch bites at his lip again (gently, this time, and then harder when a noise the Exarch does not mean to make claws out against the back of his teeth, drawing blood he once more licks away), presses his tongue into the Exarch’s mouth, and he can feel the other man’s stubble, growing atop the curve of his chin, the softness of his lips, smell the scent of him— He makes another noise, ragged and wet, curls his fingers into Emet-Selch’s chest, nails digging into the heavy cloth of his robe, and pulls him closer, pants into that open mouth in ways he did not know he either needed nor could ask for.
	At my groans of pain, Emet-Selch froze at the portal, turning to watch me with that same wary hope in his eyes, but when I regained my composure, merely panting heavily, he only spared me a quick glance before turning back around.
	"Good, then I will leave you to your final preparations.” Hades said, turning to walk back out into the Ocular.
	"It isn't  weird,"  Hades huffed, bristling at the perceived slight, "It's  skill.
	“I am Emet-Selch.
	Emet-Selch finds himself moved by this, he finds it in himself to move his arms, to reach out to palm your chest.
	Eventually you will select your Ascian titles, like I use Emet-Selch and the Architect, while my real name is -” Zodiark, I had not planned to have this out this soon, Hades thought.
	Emet-Selch lets out a soft snort.
	“So, it’s true then…” Y’shtola murmured, and she was looking at my chest the same way Emet-Selch had done so many times.
	Hades paused, giving thought to the question, and realized she was right.
	You never truly believed that when you accepted Emet-Selch’s offer and his aid, it would mean losing the friends who have become your family.
	“I care not what your read on me is, for any you come up with based on my actions alone are doomed to be woefully wrong regardless,” Emet-Selch shrugged.
	“No matter your distaste for Emet-Selch, you will  not  do this  now  .” He fell silent this time, though he stared at the conjurer with an intense look of resentment in his eyes.
	Emet reached for her neck, thumb caressing the curve of her jaw for a moment before he leaned close to her ear.
	Regardless of who offered it, Emet-Selch couldn’t deny that a drink was certainly tempting at the moment.
	Hades looked up to her, watching as the hero pushed the remaining food around, particularly the tomatoes and balsamic.
	Ryne had informed me, with a pout, that Emet-Selch had made her do part of her evening drills, but admitted they had not finished.
	Somehow, Emet-Selch had been there, striding up and down the stage, waving the script around while feeding the actors their lines.
	With a hard shove, Emet-Selch had the Exarch on his back on their little lounge and, balancing the candle expertly in one hand, moved to straddle the hips of the smaller man.
	“This...Emet-Selch,” he began again.
	Emet-Selch neither confirms nor rejects his own willingness to participate and focuses his attention squarely on their target.
	Emet-Selch looks at his hands.
	He felt like a soaked sponge, water just running out of him, except it was aether, just pouring out - then a sensation like it was pouring back in, warm and gentle - Hythlodaeus  -and he uncurled, enough -  Hades and Hythlodaeus  - until his mind could think beyond  that scream  and  that pain  and  the Doom is coming I have to tell them that it is, that it is- He came back to himself sprawled out in Hades’s bed, sticky with sweat and limbs shaking violently, his soul feeling raw but with its borders restored, if tender.
	“I would have it no other way,” Emet said, standing.
	Hades.” The way you say his name has nervousness pooling in his gut, even with the knowledge that your dissatisfaction cannot be that great.
	The Exarch settled into a slow and controlled rhythm, the crystal not taking any of the warmth from Emet-Selch's body in the slightest, remaining cool and unyielding.
	“And why do you get to make this decision?” Hades asked.
	He opened his soul up to her, Hades and Hythlodaeus, and that was all he needed for now.
	Hades is nowhere near now.
	Emet-Selch’s fingers run along her temple before burying into her hair, and Cassia seals her lips tightly around him before she starts to move.
	“Indeed, you know, when I passed up the seat of Emet-Selch I wasn’t expecting it to go to someone so  silly.”  Emet-Selch growled.
	Finally, you force yourself to turn around and look to Emet-Selch’s barrier at your friends.
	“He is an Ascian, too.” Elidibus explained calmly, meeting Emet-Selch’s golden glare unflinchingly.
	Hope incarnate, Emet-Selch hears in your memories.
	“Hades, what is it?” I all but pleaded, desperate for him to talk to me.
	A lover’s affection that even after only having spent a few bells together was so carefree and comfortable, and in such stark contrast to Emet-Selch’s demeanor forever keeping her on her toes.
	Lahabrea scoffs disdainfully, as though he’s riding off his hard work – as though Emet-Selch hasn’t been forced to clean up several of the man’s failed experiments already.
	Emet-Selch swallows.
	Which meant Hades must’ve slipped out while he was sleeping to do that boring old audit.
	“Who is the Mistress?” Hades asked.
	All but growling under his breath, Hades angrily turned from her as he grumbled something to excuse himself, though he knew it would not be so easy.
	asked Emet-Selch mildly.
	“H-Hades,” The thought of being connected with Emet-Selch, Hades, sent your heart to flutter like the wings of a butterfly.
	She knows Hades is telling the truth since she can remember talk of Hydaelyn’s summoning from back when the world was whole.
	Wasting no time, Azem picked up one of the sheets of paper on the ground and presented it to Emet-Selch with a flourish.
	Emet gazed deeply at the mage, trying not to lurch forward, to pull the other into his arms, to hold him until the end of the universe, never let go, never again.
	“Help me to remember, Hades.” Hades pulls from your lips, hot breath falling down the slope of your neck as he still clutches you to him.
	“Mayhaps it has to do with your newly budding relationship with Emet-Selch that has caught the attention of not only myself, but of everyone.
	As Olivier shut the door behind him, Hades had to admit a level of surprise.
	I quickly looked up at Hades, who tilted his head to the side, hand going to his mouth in thought.
	"Go away, Emet-Selch," said G'raha.
	Perhaps later on, Emet-Selch would tell them just how glorious they had looked.
	Minutes turn into hours and Aestelle has yet to leave Hades side, patiently sitting in the same chair she has been for nearly an entire day now while she watches over him.
	Emet-Selch ached with how much he wanted that and was astounded that he was unable to identify his feelings until now.
	Hades took the letters and leaned against the desk beside her, looking them over.
	“You must have done a number on each other,” Igeyorhm commented, walking past Emet-Selch.
	“Well, seems the gang is all here,” Emet-Selch regarded the other only remaining Ascians with a mockingly pleasant smile, the venom clear beneath his words.
	Hades’s lips and tongue explored their shaft, tip flicking around the sound, pressing against it, teasing Azem into thinking there might be more coming to stretch them.
	On the advice of Olivier and Tataru, Hades takes (Y/N) on a date to the Gold Saucer.
	I can’t,” Hades said, “I can’t die, Prometheus.
	Though he always knew Hades saw what he did, it’s still nice to hear him say it.
	She turned to look down at her side only to find Hades lying asleep beside her, chest slowly rising and falling and his expression calm.
	And Emet-Selch has long run out of words that truly comfort her.
	Cassia remembers seeing Hades smile for the first time as they exchange tentative first words.
	“Aestelle?” Hades said her name, panic clearly rising as he starts walking quickly towards her.
	Which means Hades is stuck here too.
	“Asleep, you say?” Emet said, pondering.
	After knowing each other for so long, he knew how Hades ticked.
	Emet-Selch looked at him, starting to say something before he cut him off.
	Ultimately, it was Elidibus who convinced both Emet-Selch and I to leave you in your sundered state for if our mission to bring back our world failed, only you could be entrusted to see these vain reflections to a brighter future.
	Emet….Hades had grabbed his arm and instead of staying calm, he cast break and sent him away.
	But, unexpectedly—or perhaps unsurprisingly—it was those two words that proved to be the undoing of Emet-Selch’s self-control.
	“Ours,” Hythlodaeus interjected, feeling Hades and Azem both twitch in response to his tone.
	“Do they  really  never read between the lines?” Hades mumbled under his breath, just barely loud enough for me to catch.
	And to make matters worse, my best friend from back then, Hythlodaeus, came to me only to tell me Hades had already slipped away from the ball.
	“Ah, don’t interrupt, my dear, this is one of the best parts,” Emet-Selch chides, and the look he gives her across the rim of his glasses sends a heated tingle of lust through her.
	Than the very man who administered her punishment today whereas in the past, Emet-Selch would often choose to be at the receiving end of such things instead.
	“Hades, enough.” I urged, standing beside him at the bar and lightly touching his arm.
	With some adjustments, Hades wove his legs with Hythlodaeus and Azem and sat facing them, his shaft pressed against that of a whimpering Azem.
	“Please!” you cry in frustration, and Emet-Selch gives a low, wicked chuckle; the sound  tugs  at things deep in your core, and you can’t help the needy little whine that escapes your lips.
	“He has far more self-control than that,” Hades said peevishly.
	Hades tenses beside you and only too late do you realize your mistake.
	Hades remembered that day well.
	As Krile shut the door to the Dawn’s Respite softly behind her, I couldn’t help but wonder if the Scions would be as receptive to eating those sandwiches if they’d known Emet-Selch had created them, and I held back a smirk at the thought of telling Thancred after he had already eaten his fill.
	Hades gently detached himself from his friend’s grasp and stepped inside.
	A shuddering thrust from Emet-Selch at her words tipped her over into a sweet release.
	Tucking the tiny buds in his ears, Emet-Selch was momentarily confused by what he heard, but comprehension quickly overtook him and he tore them free.
	Hades felt as though he was staring at his sins, as if he was reading his own ledger, dripping, reeking, swathed with the blood and death from eons of wrongs, of tempered hatred and pain.
	She scowled as Hades looked down at her, “Can I show you something?” Hades nodded—it was a commonly avoided inquiry, “I…this is so stupid…I, you know I don’t like to talk about it, I guess?” “If it makes you uncomfortable, hero, you need not worry,” Hades replied, quickly.
	“My sincerest apologies, Xelinah,” Hythlodaeus says, lowering his mask slightly to catch her eye, “I should have considered what teleporting with Emet-Selch might have meant with your form being sustained on his aether.
	Emet arrived at his answer.
	G'raha's skin prickled as Emet-Selch traced that boundary, feeling the heat of his fingers, feeling his heartbeat quicken and praying silently that Emet-Selch could not tell even as the corner of the man's mouth twitched upward.
	He had encouraged and been excited when he first learned of Hades's future self's relationship with her.
	“That’s it, that’s it, good boy,” Hades muttered roughly, “You can come so many times, can’t you?”  “Again,” Hades ordered, his tentacle thrusting deep inside of him, pressing hard against a sweet spot that had Prometheus forgetting what breathing was.
	Unmoving, uncooperative long enough Hades and Hythlodaeus both feel a familiar thrill down their spine.
	“What’s wrong?” Emet-Selch asked, giving Elidibus a playful pout.
	Emet-Selch does not delude himself; he is pleasing to the eye, certainly – this form was specially crafted, after all – and he had a practiced charm of ages.
	“Already being sent off to be used as pawns, how dull.” Hades sighed under his breath.
	In response, Emet-Selch made a half-snort, half-snoring noise and rolled over again, not wanting to deal with this ball of sunshine in the middle of the night.
	Hearing the tremor in your voice, Emet-Selch reaches across the bed and pulls you over into his lap, and you are not so distraught as to miss that he doesn’t use his arms to do it, but rather several of the velvety-soft deep violet tentacles you’d glimpsed in the bath.
	“In the lead up to Starlight, yes,” Hades muttered, “Just the usual.”  Prometheus looked from him, to Hades, and back again, frowning a little.
	Holding them up at his hips, Hades began rummaging through his remaining stack of clothes for the belt he’d received a few days prior.
	“H…How do you know…” Hades grunted, trying his best to keep pace with the two carrying him.
	The eerie silence raised the fine hairs on the back of your neck, yet you were determined to find whoever invited you to Amaurot; especially now that Emet-Selch was no more.
	Elidibus… He’s someone who hasn’t crossed her mind nearly as much as Hades since she’s come back in time.
	He’s just, Emet.” Aestelle turned on her stool to look back at Hades.
	Not that she thinks she’ll need to rush out of here in a hurry, or that Emet-Selch will even let her be on her own, but she’d much rather know where she is than not.
	“How are you though, my beloved Hades?
	Hades looked back to his cup with a sneer.
	Hades found himself smirking as he began to remove himself from his core, his soul.
	“Emet-Selch is our creator and we certainly act on the will he instilled within each of us, yet that does not detract from the honest bonds we once shared with you.
	"As amusing as this is," Hythlodaeus cut in before Hades gave into his clear impulse to grab Prometheus into a punishing headlock, "I do want this garden completed today…"  "Right," Prometheus said blithely, like he wasn’t the instigator of that distraction, "Like I was saying, Hades can show off his  precise touch  for flowers and-"  "Skill," Hades gritted out.
	I implored Hades to wait, to help me find another solution, but he refused.” He sighed, looking down at his lap, a sad smile spreading across is lips as I continued.
	Emet-Selch lets out a scoff.
	Emet-Selch slanted a heavy-lidded look his way, his mouth curving into a smile that put Aza on edge.
	Then two fell silent, Hades lost in his own memories, the Warrior of Light giving him breath before another line of inquiry.
	Emet-Selch pushed me hard, and I could tell it was so that he could push himself harder- to prepare himself fully for what was to come.
	Hades found the door was locked, but jerked it open anyway, tiny steel screws and the lock plate skittering across the floor.
	“Hades instructed me to come here,” Hythlodaeus chirps with that absolutely disgusting good cheer and sweet demeanor, “And let you know what I think of you.” If Hades has specifically invited your mutual friend to participate without telling him exactly what he was getting into, you’re going to wring his neck.
	Unfortunately, this did not end the fight immediately like Hades had hoped.
	Emet-Selch cups her cheek, his thumb grazing gently over her skin as he leans back, but only enough so he can look into her eyes.
	Emet-Selch looks startled for a moment, then he smiles at you, expression now holding a sincere warmth that echoes the sweet smile you liked so much in Amaurot.
	“Maybe,” Hades said, idly stroking his friend’s hair.
	Emet-Selch is not the speaker.
	Emet holds tight to his prize.
	“Oh, don’t look at me like that.” Hades said, his tone much softer and more gentle as he turns his attention to her.
	She pulled down her sweater over the length of her torso, nearly freezing and tripping over her feet when Professor Emet turned from the corner of the hallway.
	Hades pondered this—he was nearly certain he remembered Summoner with a white iris neath his scared lid, much like the Scion seer woman.
	“I did nothing to deserve such scorn.” Hythlodaeus raised his hand and slowly caressed from Hades’ arm to his shoulder.
	Emet-Selch too is staring at the flower.
	He heard Emet mumble something, his ear turning toward the noise, but he did not pick it up.
	"Yes, oh honorable Emet-Selch?"
	“Children’s toys.” Azem had explained when Emet-Selch asked.
	What he is sure Emet-Selch has seen and more.
	He did not earn the name Hades for nothing.
	Let them answer the question.” Hythlodaeus raised a foot and pressed gently against Hades’s groin until the other man obeyed and sat back, releasing Azem.
	“Something,” he said, when Hades gave him a very cautious nudge, “Tried to claw into me.
	Getting comfortable it would seem means removing hood and mask, as Emet-Selch does so.
	“Just...  sit there and look pretty,” Hades finally said, “It’ll motivate me.” Hades left him to it, turning back to his drawing board.
	He only wished he were surprised to see the delicate hors d’oeuvres, but at this point, Hades knew she was going to make him suffer the entire seventeen courses.
	Looking from her to her comrades who regard him with nothing but cold skepticism, Hades sighed and shook his head with an added hand on his hip.
	Their gazes met, Hades giving him such a self-satisfied look, before he slowly, torturously slowly, bent his head low and…  “Ah-  hhnn…  ” Prometheus felt like he died when Hades’s lips wrapped around his aching cock, his hips pinned down hard by Hades’s hands when he mindlessly tried to thrust into that wet heat.
	“Hades…” She whispered his name as she reached down to brush through his white hair.
	She didn’t hide what she wanted from him, and too late Emet-Selch realized this was her ploy all along.
	“Yes,” Hades said.
	Hades looked at him with a fair degree of incredulousness.
	“Are we doing the right thing?” Hades’ voice asked, muffled, as he sat forward in a chair, face in his palm.
	But her mouth was quite full of Emet-Selch’s cock.
	The large shade of Lahabrea carefully lifted Hades from off her back, Aestelle’s arms and legs finally giving out as she falls to lie on the ground.
	Emet arrived two minutes late to class, and Aletheia hadn’t been skipping class  that  often enough to know that was unusual for him.
	Hades didn’t hesitate in gently wrapping his arms around her small frame, pulling her close as she buries her face into his chest and softly cries.
	Emet-Selch shakes his head.
	"You promised to never speak of that,"  Prometheus hissed, thrusting a finger at Hades’s nose, "That only happened  once,  anyways, and when we were practically kids!
	“I will not be an Ascian.” Her voice was measured and calm, and Hades found he hated not being able to read her emotions.
	“You always were the straight-forward one.” I watched Ryne make an attempt at whatever Emet-Selch was teaching her.
	Emet Selch was bound to be the most seductive man in this plane, she cursed inwardly, it’s always only a matter of time before surrender.
	Hades gasped as one of the tendrils worked into him, others coiling around his nipples.
	Hades never knew why he played coy like that - in an hour or so he’d be like an octopus, clinging to him and squeezing the life out of him.
	Sitting on her knees, Aestelle stayed at Hades’ side, laying her upper body over his to press her ear to his chest as she just sits there waiting for one of the shades to come back.
	“The Hades from the stories of your past.” Alisaie spoke up.
	That Emet-Selch crossed the Rift to give him this, not speaking to hold it in his mouth, is half of what spurs the Exarch to fist the front of his robe and jerk Emet-Selch back down, their teeth banging together unceremoniously, breaking the Exarch’s lip.
	Don't mind me just crying over Hades, I'm fine :'))) Also I'm having fun writing in extra Ascian things just because I can xD I shouldn't be allowed to write lul Like we got angel-wings-almost-Lightwarden Aestelle because I'm given free rein to do what I want :3 Mistakes have been made A trip to the Umbilicus reveals a very different conversation than the one she first remembers seeing through her Echo, this time between G'raha Tia and Hades.
	“Hades.” Emet-Selch licks his lips slow, then presses them to yours in a kiss more soft than the others.
	Hades put a hand on my shoulder, knowing the thoughts that were spinning through my mind.
	Hearing Emet-Selch cry out for you, moan your name even; the feeling is beyond words.
	The sight made Hades draw in a sharp breath.
	“Stubborn until the end, Hades…” I grumbled as I walked past him, though I couldn’t help the smile that came to my lips when he scoffed from behind me.
	Except, ever since he had been under Emet-Selch’s tender care, something fundamental must’ve been damaged inside of him somewhere.
	Her mind goes back to her last talk with Emet-Selch.
	Hythlodaeus is in prime form today and Emet-Selch is a little sorry Azem is missing this.
	Her voice broke Hades heart, he hated how broken she sounded.
	Hades scoffed and gestured down to his hands, “When can these accursed things come off?” Hades, hesitantly, drank down its contents, gasping in refreshment as the elezen removed it once more, emptied.
	“I know,” Hades said.
	Hades’ eyes examined her, trying to read the meaning between her words, but he couldn’t sense it, not as he had before.
	A hand landed over hers from behind, causing her to jump as Hades leans over to place his chin down onto her shoulder.
	Goodbye Ran'jit o7 Thank you for being around for like 3 chapters and promptly dying :3 On the bright side next chapter we get to see Hades again so yay!
	“Ah, you are finally awake, I see, and already messing with aether again,”  comes Emet-Selch’s slightly disapproving voice from somewhere out of the dark around her.
	He pressed his palms flat against the unmoving chest, searched - dug deep, reached out for that familiar spark - Prometheus was a  brat, he would always try to block him out and hide himself if he was angry enough, but Emet-Selch  always  found him.
	Also Hades isn't even trying to make friends with the Scions lmao like oh my gosh when I first saw this cutscene in-game I choked on my water from laughing It’s exhausting.” Hades said, his voice borderline on a whine while they continue down the Silent Cliffs from Wolekdorf.
	“Of those among us comfortable with our magic to use teleportation, Emet-Selch and Lahabrea are the ones with the most experience against these beasts.
	Emet-Selch realizes when Elidibus turns to him that his presence had not gone unacknowledged, but the emissary’s gesture to him is bare and more for effect than aught else.
	Hades doesn’t respond, so Helios cants his head up to ask Hythlodaeus’s chin.
	“Most esteemed Emet-Selch of the Convocation of Fourteen,” The seething annoyance in your tone, low and searing as the pressure you press on his core, speaks yet greater volumes of your frustration, “What would they say, seeing you reduced to such a state?
	“Remember, Emet-Selch - don’t go on some rampage now that you are restored to your power.
	Much as he had before, Hades remained quiet while he and her walked side by side at the back of their small group.
	He looked to be in no better condition than Hades; golden hair a disheveled mess and Elidibus himself having a myriad of cuts littering his face while his platinum blonde near white hair drapes out over the Speakers arms to hang down and sway in the gentle breeze.
	“No, this is fine,” Hades said, gently urging Prometheus to lean back in.
	The two Ascians exchange a glance, and then Emet-Selch sighs heavily.
	Waving him off, Hades stepped foot into the portal and tugged Aestelle along with him, both of them walking hand in hand into their first of what she hopes to be many more adventures to come.
	Emet-Selch did not mince words well.
	Emet-Selch winced as he leaned away, breathing as heavily as the Summoner.
	Beneath your fingers, Hades’s face blooms into familiar amusement, cheeks warming to your fingertips in delight, rumbles of amusement trembling through him.
	Carefully, Hades kept them closed.
	“Is me trusting Emet really so bad?
	Hades leaned back in his chair and huffed, the breath of it stirring the hair that hung over his face.
	Emet-Selch walked in at his typical languid pace, though it probably took most of us a few seconds to even register that it was Emet-Selch we were looking at.
	What makes you think I’ve been ‘won over’?” Now it’s Hades’ turn to prop himself up to look at Hythlodaeus.
	Even like this, impossibly tall and brimming with aether, Hades doesn’t frighten her.
	The traveler draped one arm around him and held out the other to Hades; reluctantly he leaned in, allowing himself to be drawn into a loose embrace.
	Emet-Selch enjoys baked goods.
	But that made things more difficult: if he was genuinely surprised, it made her wonder if perhaps Emet-Selch had been more honest than she was comfortable admitting.
	Hythlodaeus underneath him, Emet-Selch pinning him in place, Hythlodaeus’ head cushioned in Azem’s lap.
	Creation…from aether,” Krile looked at the sandwich a moment longer, then back to Emet-Selch, as if comparing him to his creation.
	Hades felt it was in an effort to save his hands, but he put the notion aside—he could have managed.
	[I love you, Hades],  my mind said to his as I closed my eyes and pressed my forehead to his.
	Hythlodaeus, who their mutual friend never failed to come to, even with matters hidden from Emet-Selch, had heard nothing.
	Hades scoffed.
	A strained, tinny noise of agony left him, because everything was loud  (like that scream that scream that scream)  because Hades’s home was in the  middle of Amaurot  and millions of souls crashed over his bleeding borders, drowning him, and he couldn’t  get them out - Hades was now leaning over him, his mask nowhere to be seen, dark brown hair tumbling into his eyes, his hands clasped over Prometheus’s damp cheeks.
	“You seem wary of me,” He stated, coolly, “I assure you, your tribulation against the Warrior of Light was by design, Emet-Selch.
	Hades shuffled over to act annoyed.
	Hades jaw clenched as he glared at the red-haired male, “You cannot be proposing what I think you mean to…” The room quietened as they turned to him, shocked by the sudden remark, the venom in his voice.
	Emet-Selch groans.
	“We have already learned that the ancients—the people of Emet-Selch’s time—they were not evil Ascians.
	For now, Hades continued to dance, letting the Orchestrion play without interruption - twirling her about the small room while his mind catalogued her every reaction.
	“No!” Hades jumped at the force in Hythlodaeus’ voice.
	Emet-Selch threw up his hands and sighed.
	Neither of us thought it a possibility, but it happened nonetheless.” Next to me, Hades’ annoyance intensified.
	The shard from this world: one that Emet-Selch had no doubt meant to destroy ages ago.
	Emet wondered if she realized her arrival and acceptance of his invitation meant they were past the point of no return.
	Emet-Selch thought about where Azem could have gotten this illness from.
	Hades grunted when that odd phrase filtered through his half-awake mind, and he squinted past his duvet cocoon to see Prometheus and Hythlodaeus in very animated conversation.
	It was older than Amaurot, old when their people first learned the magic of Creation, and Hades remembered studying its architectural science avidly when preparing for taking the title of- “Hades,” Prometheus sighed, “We’re in the most  beautiful  city on the continent, and you’re sitting here with your nose in a book.”  “It’s a very good book,” Hades said idly, but he did lower it.
	“Let us take care of you tonight,” Emet-Selch says, weighing the heavy words on his tongue.
	Even Hades seemed slightly taken aback at her vague admission.
	“Well,” Hades leaned back slightly, resting himself upon the tops of his heels.
	Though doing so without Emet-Selch and Hythlodaeus there with her this time feels emptier, they were never supposed to be there to begin with.
	Or as fond as someone like Emet-Selch could ever be of anyone.
	Hades felt his stomach knot at the name—so flippantly they tossed it out, did it not bother her?
	A few determined strokes used to rouse his shaft further before her mouth ghosted a caress along the tip, and Emet-Selch let out a subdued groan.
	As Hades settled into his own seat, the servants placed covered dishes before them, and poured a touch of wine into (Y/N)’s glass.
	This had been his fear, knowing how Hades would seek her once freed, liberated of his temperament—he was of sound mind, but the danger that could present was paramount.
	What he's looking at is Emet-Selch, fidgety with the desperate urge to palm himself through his clothes like an overwrought youth, plainly and obviously painfully erect even through his robes.
	Emet hadn’t put on that show for her originally, nor did he try to get that close to her—embarrassment washed over the warrior.
	He sighed, “Even if I wanted to, hero,” Hades looked back to the door, gesturing with his head.
	She has one arm around Emet-Selch’s neck and another on Elidibus’ chest, playing with his nipples.
	Hythlodaeus’ only comfort is knowing that the terrible burden of their great work will not fall squarely on Emet-Selch’s shoulders.
	This family is what I wish to protect─and that does sadly include you, Emet.”  “Don’t make me sick.” Hades scoffed.
	“Coupled with Emet-Selch’s story, I can see why such a thing would fill your dreams.” When I lifted my head, I watched as Urianger looked up at Y’shtola, who came around again, stopping on Emet-Selch’s other side.
	“It’s not safe for you,” Hades tells him.
	Thank you, Hades, for loving me.
	“I guess not.” There is a strange sense of understanding between them as they keep looking at each other before Emet-Selch suddenly leans closer.
	That could mean anything, and not necessarily bad either, but still… Hades couldn’t help but worry.
	At her flippant answer, Emet-Selch lets out an amused chuckle.
	There’s a few seconds of silence, although to you they feel like an eternity before Hythlodaeus turns to Emet-Selch, who sighs again.
	Emet-Selch knew he'd had nothing of the sort, so he could only blink with incredulity.
	Hades suddenly cursed, and his soul fluttered, a snap of his fingers - and it was like a soundproof blanket had been tossed over him.
	Still wonder what Emet-Selch means to him, because he  cares ).
	The people in attendance ceased speaking and waited with bated breath as Hades appeared, now clad in his travel robes and mask, his dark aether swirling around him, hovering a few fulms in the air, above the crowd.
	“Apologies for the interruption, Emet-Selch.
	This is the stance that Elidibus had adopted by the time the Allagan Empire had been prospering, when Emet-Selch was funneling his energies into Emperor Xande.
	As Emet’s corporeal form began to fade, the backdrop of chimes suddenly broke through, wailing like sirens in her head.
	"We didn't have the chance," Emet-Selch said.
	Emet-Selch gave the miqo’te a measured look at that, but she brushed it off—they were not, not…right now.
	"There is no reason to sulk so," Emet-Selch purred.
	He’d been embarrassed by those eyes, that look, many a time, and the years didn’t seem to make him any less flustered, “D-Don’t make me repeat it, hero.” Hades waved his hand again, turning away.
	“I always pamper you,” Hades said flatly.
	Hades knew what Hythlodaeus was implying.
	“How can you be so calm when the woman you love is missing as well?” Hades seethed, anger flashing across his face.
	And now with Hades here, who knows what might happen?
	If it is his desire to merely please and not to take pleasure, that was something you could grow to accept, but you had the sinking feeling that despite seeing his body naked, you had never truly seen Emet-Selch.
	Helios dances away, but Hades still manages to capture Hythlodaeus as his prize.
	He pulled back from Hades with mischief in his eyes.
	Why, how, under what circumstances he brought it to the fore – Emet-Selch does not remember and does not care to.
	After months away from Hades and Hythlodaeus, Azem found themselves both homesick…and attention-starved.
	Hades...  “One last time, Emet-Selch.
	14th!WoL, however, remembers a young man in her classes by the name of Hades, & also greatly enjoys arguing with Lahabrea.
	Even when Lahabrea had still been alive, the fool had been too consumed by his desire for chaos to do much anything else of note—no, he had not managed to accomplish even a modicum of what Emet-Selch himself had been able to in all the time given to them.
	And whoever the librarian was, in the end, he’s a creation of Emet-Selch’s.
	Emet-Selch chuckles softly at her attempts to undress him as Cassia lets out a huff of frustration.
	Hades took stock of the both of us, making sure we weren’t missing any limbs, then looked around at our surroundings.
	Without waiting for the response, Emet-Selch closed the gap between them, brusquely pushing the Exarch aside with little resistance.
	Hades stood beyond  Valstrax’s  barrier, his mask in place, but his concern and worry was so  vivid, so much like… how it was before, so much like… It had been three days since Prometheus had fled in a wild panic from them and Hades was sick with worry.
	Emet grants Aletheia a moment before they depart.
	Emet-Selch and the elezen paused, the other Scions now included, before looking back to her with raised brows.
	“Says you.” Emet-Selch shrugged.
	Hades’s hand closed around his, forcing his rhythm to a stuttering, abrupt stop.
	“Hades…” The whisper of his name is nearly a sob, and a second later, he soothes her burning soul with a kiss so sweet Cassia knows it’s their last.
	Goodbye you two.” And with that, Lord Edmont turned to head back the way he came, leaving Aestelle and Hades there to watch him disappear back down the alleyway.
	“You don’t intend to run to her side as well?” Hades asked while he looked down at her, arms crossed over his broad chest once more.
	“Just…” Prometheus said breathlessly, making a tiny noise when Hades magicked the blanket away when he reached the edge of his bed.
	But Hades could only remember his eyes.
	It would probably do better than the usual rabble, Emet-Selch groused to himself.
	She almost doesn't notice that Emet-Selch moves, not until he suddenly stands much closer.
	So long as she yet lives, she will never stop striving towards a bright tomorrow that both Hades and Elidibus can see with their own two eyes.
	As he watched the rest of the convocation depart, Emet-Selch was left with his thoughts.
	Or that Fandaniel is in Asahi’s body?”At my words, Emet-Selch only crossed his arms and stared at me, as if he could find what he was looking for in my face.“Perhaps your dear Hydaelyn told you of Zodiarks condition and whereabouts.
	Rather than give him what he wanted, Hythlodaeus broke the kiss and stroked Hades’s chin with his thumb, an appraising smile on his face.
	With some difficulty, Hades obeyed.
	But when the sun started to dip below the horizon, Hades took hold of my hand and opened a portal.
	Hades wants to answer, his mind already triggering a suitably scathing response, but then Hythlodaeus’s hand is in his hair, keeping him right where he is.
	It pushes, and pushes, and it doesn’t matter how many times Hades has done this before: he feels on the absolute verge of breaking in two, the sting of being stretched so far beyond intended naught but fuel to the drawn out cry that wrenches itself free from his throat.
	Lahabrea’s golden gaze immediately moves to Elidibus, and a slight shifting of Emet-Selch’s posture tells you that he, too, has turned his attention to the Emissary.
	Chapter Three:   Jealousy (Emet-Selch/Azem/Hythlodaeus) When Emet-Selch begins to notice that his two closest companions are spending more and more time together, he resolutely tells himself that he will remain unbothered.
	"No," Hythlodaeus is quick to reassure him, bowl and fork abandoned in favor of reaching across the desk to snag Emet-Selch's sleeve, winding those clever fingers around Emet-Selch's wrist.
	Emet rocks his hips at your sound of approval and you gasp.
	“Olivier contacted (Y/N), and I remember, she stood up in the middle of the meeting, and said, ‘If any one of you harms the Ascian, then I will bring about the Calamity myself.’ Then her nose started bleeding and she ran from the room.” Tataru giggled, but Hades’s eyes had snapped to (Y/N), to her straight back, the way her feet had slid into a duelist’s stance, even though she bore no weapon - and the way she had interposed herself between him and her opponent.
	Gosh the real challenge of this fic isn't even trying to fit Emet into the plot anymore, it's just finding time to explore everything I desperately want to xD Aestelle glanced up at Hades for a moment, dust flying along the sticky warm breeze that blows through the Ghimlyt Dark.
	You-” Emet-Selch began, only to be cut off when Azem leaned down and kissed the top of Hythlodaeus’ head, before tossing Emet-Selch the grapes and sprinting off, loudly reciting the oath they had taken when they accepted the seat of Azem.
	He had not come into this room as Solus zos Galvus, Garlean Emperor, but as Emet-Selch, the Ascian.
	He did not regret his choice to stay with Hades.
	“Mm,” Hythlodaeus made a vague noise, “Stop hovering over him, Hades.
	Obvious implications hid behind those words and though Emet-Selch merely snorted at his friend’s adventurous spirit, Aeliana spun around on her heel so fast that for a split second, a spot of dizziness blurred her sight.
	“Finally,” the Emissary huffed, and tossed a drowsing infant towards Emet-Selch.
	“Tell me, Hades.” It hushes from your breath as you feel his lips press against the bare skin along the curve of your shoulder.
	“His ‘true colours’...?” Emet-Selch whispered, then let out that ugly not-laughing noise, “You  never  knew Prometheus, none of you.
	His soul was still a  wreck,  Hades noted worriedly.
	The more time you spend there, the more it becomes painfully obvious why Emet-Selch does what he does and why he can not be reasoned with.
	Hades made move to stand, but the ginger-haired Summoner stopped him, “Let me help you.” Hades scowled as he held out his arm, allowing D’ve to take hold of his bicep.
	He bites down against Hades' neck, tasting copper and the heady tang of his aether beneath his tongue as he breaks skin.
	“Someday soon.” She mused, resisting the urge to glance over her shoulder to Hades who has been silently standing near the wall since she entered the Ocular.
	Aestelle pushed herself harder into Hades’ side, trying to not slip back into the memories that haunt her.
	And Emet-Selch-  “The Ascian could-,” his sister started once more, but he held his hand up to stop her, looking over her shoulder at Emet-Selch, who was...worse for wear.
	Hades caught her words with his lips, shoving them back down her throat with his own tongue as he explored every inch of her mouth as voraciously as he could.
	White-hot pleasure blinds them all, quickly pushing both Helios and Hythlodaeus over the edge in sync, each sputter and twitch of their cocks punching yet another choked moan out of Hades’s lips.
	“On that note,” Alisaie started, “Why is it that Emet-Selch doesn’t have an affinity?
	To express relief that such a terrible and dangerous foe was  finally  dead… it might incur Emet-Selch’s rage.
	Though puzzled, Hades looked at the selection, mulled it over, then did as asked—selecting one with bulbs of varied length and girth dotting its length.
	Why did Prometheus tell Hythlodaeus his woes but brushed Hades’s concern off?
	“Heh, ‘cuz it’s cute watching you fluster a little,” Prometheus admitted, pressing his fingertips against Hades’s chest, “It’s our  anniversary, you dork.” But he was smiling, and he drew a little shape on Hades’s chest before pulling completely away, “But that’s fine.
	Emet-Selch was well aware of just how much he looked up to both he and Azem as fellow members of the convocation.
	Emet-Selch crosses his arms, brow furrowed in thought.
	“My, my, look at how needy Hades is for you.” Azem’s breath caught in their throat, their gaze transfixed on Hades as he writhed on his back, his legs pulled wide apart by the lavender tendrils.
	“Honestly, that is the last favor either of you will be getting out of me.” With his arms folded, Emet-Selch made every effort to sell his displeasure.
	Emet set his cup down.
	Turn her deaf to whatever Emet-Selch had planned to say next as she wandered off to admire a patch of flowers that emitted a luminous glow.
	In response, Emet-Selch raises up a hand and snaps his fingers, vanishing both sets of robes and leaving himself and Elidibus wearing only loose trousers of a soft, rich fabric.
	Hades had been more occupied with the problems in front of him.
	Azem is humming as he pulls a cup from thin air and uses it to rinse Emet-Selch's hair.
	“And you deign to implore me for your Champion’s tale?” Hades feigned a chuckle.
	In the darkest depths of the sea, wrapped in solitude and silence, Emet-Selch sleeps among shades.
	“The melodramatic metaphor won’t aid you in your cause,” Hades gestured his gaze down to the loaf, “I’ll not be acting to break bread with you, or your precious Scions.” Hades watched as he left the tomes and continued, removing himself from Ascian’s chamber with another, hopeful, bow.
	The streets are empty, only the echo of their steps breaking through the silence as Hades chases the shadow of Asteria’s back.
	Hades sighed.
	He had a faint impression of being annoyed at him, but that was pretty much the default emotion when dealing with Emet-Selch, so… Amaurotine!WoL+Emet-Selch+Hythlodaeus - Friends “Are you and Emet-Selch still fighting?” Hythlodaeus was unhappy, in the same way that Hades had been unhappy with him.
	“But he also seems...confident that he is not at fault.” Hades squeezed my hand.
	Emet-Selch scowls at the implication, waving a hand dismissively.
	“Thank you for bringing her back to me.” Hades dipped his head to the hero’s father and turned to me.
	In fact, knowing what Hades did about Prometheus, he could safely hypothesise that this ‘experiment’ would result in Prometheus caving first as he was  pathetically  sensitive if you knew the right places to touch- Abruptly, Hades found himself much more amicable to the idea, and he smiled.
	He wants it so bad that he's stopped checking for any smarmy reactions from Emet-Selch to respond to.
	But I don’t understand how it is you think Emet can be saved.
	Or like the sudden burst of pain that had shot through her heart when Emet-Selch had kissed her.
	And even way before that, back in the cave as Emet-Selch, he had told her to be bold.
	Hythlodaeus' eyes hold the same glow they always do when he is peering into the soul of another and he spots it moments before Emet-Selch does.
	Leaning forward to get a better look at her face, Hades smirked, his eyes sparkling with the same gold as some of the stars up above as moonlight falls upon them.
	Hades would reach for her, imagining her tear stained face, her blood, and it would excite him, only for his own body to disobey him just before he touched her.
	Alisaie gently put her hand on my arm again, her other reaching for the rapier at her side as Emet-Selch and I stared at each other in silence, my heartbeat pounding in my ears.
	“Was this a result of you testing my hypothesis?” she turned to Emet-Selch then with great worry, her voice laden with guilt.
	Hades looked up at her, brow raised, “They’ll hand over their knowledge so easily?” Besides Emet-Selch, over the passing days, had divulged that he hoped to work through and reobtain some of the control on his aether.
	“It’s about time.” With the immediate danger passed, Emet-Selch strode with a brisk pace toward the field where charred rings still smoldered.
	“Well Aestelle could have told you that much.” Hades scoffed.
	Not taken unawares in a dress shop, accompanied by not only his guards, but the entire population of Garlemald that supports him,” Emet-Selch finished with a casual shrug, giving me what I could only describe as a look.
	Hades was disappointed I would not  be attending the celebration with him, but while I was a citizen of Eorzea and had participated in various meetings of the same nature, this wasn’t  my  responsibility nor did I feel I was needed to help keep the peace with the Scions in attendance.
	Your breathing grows shallow and uneven while Hades leans his face close, so very close to your sex, bound by sodden and sheer material.
	“You’re not well,” Hades worries.
	Eventually, Emet-Selch sagged again, the hope he had felt wearing thin once more.
	Hades doesn’t know, but he does it, the feeling comes again and again, the tug in his chest and the pain – oh, the pain, the anguish that burns in his breast, as fresh as the day it was born with Zodiark and the deaths of half his people – it comes again, along with a flood greater still of that feeling, impossible and overwhelming and elating.
	“Well, I needed to complain about Emet-Selch,” she said slyly, diverting the topic away from that.
	Emet-Selch, the only part of this whole madness that somehow still makes sense, feels real when everything else around her seems to follow no logic or reason anymore.
	“Hm,” Hades inclined his head, watching as Emilia pushed at them yet again.
	Each spark of pain, each sucking pull makes Hades’s hips twitch on instinct, grinding against Hythlodaeus’s smooth stomach, looking for any slight friction he can find…but that, too, is stopped, as both his lovers’ hands immediately clasp onto his hips, clearly of one mind when it comes to denying him release.
	The dress she’d chosen was knee-length and pale pink with a boatneck top, black butterflies sewn into the sheer over-layer of tulle in her skirt and tied around the middle with a black ribbon, matching the one Hades had given her before we left initially, which she still wore braided into her hair.
	To you, this is what Emet-Selch is.
	Hades looked oddly pained at that.
	While certainly embarrassing for me, at the very least the sacrifice of my pride had managed to take some of the dark cast off of both the room, and Emet-Selch’s face as he continued to watch me.
	Not only was my motivation simply remembering my life as Azem, but also so that I would properly be able to share in Emet-Selch’s deep sadness, to carry some of his burdens, and to reassure him he’s no longer alone.
	Pinching the bridge of his nose, Hades briefly considered just walking away.
	A clap startles you as Hythlodaeus gently places an arm on Emet-Selch’s shoulder while keeping you close with the other.
	Returning to this phantom recreation of Amaurot with Hades lying asleep in her arms, the both of them on the ground within the Macarenses Angle in front of the main Aetheryte is surreal to say the least─like this is all some cruel dream she’ll wake up from any second now.
	Elidibus found Emet-Selch sitting in one of the fractured ruins of Amaurot, staring at Prometheus’s dead body.
	And Hades and I will see that our legacy will never be forgotten.
	He was sure that Emet-Selch had a heart beat, that blood might even flow from that body should it be injured.
	“This is your first time on the Source, is it not?” Hades inquired.
	The more differences crop up between this traveler and the nuisance he loves, the more at ease Emet-Selch finds himself.
	?” Hades didn’t bother hiding a smile at Prometheus’s adorable sounds of absolute indignation, waiting him out for half a minute before closing his book and rising from his seat.
	After a time, Emet’s eyebrows lifted, “I’m an acquaintance now, I take it?”  “Oh, we wouldn’t want to make the Warrior of Darkness wait now, would we?” Emet jeered, then sighed once he saw the miqo’te’s stoic reaction.
	Hades was no longer facing him.
	Hades heard the quiet groan as a thousand bows were pulled taut.
	Emet-Selch stands, brushing off his robes, heedless to the splatter of crimson against his neck.
	Hades bent the same, clutching his ribs with a sharp inhale of breath.
	“Hythlodaeus is going to be annoyed if we’re late,” Hades mumbled, looking as unmotivated as Prometheus felt.
	They are not deserving of your loyalty, or your love and compassion!.” Hades said, his image becoming muddled the more her grip on consciousness fades due to the Light continuing its attack on her fracturing soul.
	The tone of his voice seemed to imply he had known Emet-Selch would be appearing at that very moment, and the portal to Elidibus’ side only confirmed those thoughts.
	At least, that’s what she hoped for should she survive the next few bells without further arousing Emet-Selch’s suspicions, and then there was her mission.
	Out of the corner of his eye he sees his observer flinch, and Elidibus wonders if the flatness of it hurts worse than Lahabrea’s rage or Emet-Selch’s resignation.
	Hades easily held him close, ignoring the vicious stamping on his toes as the  thing  undulated and twisted its unnatural, disgusting body towards them.
	The hot spike of arousal that shot through Prometheus’s soul almost made Hades dizzy, and he pulled away, feeling satisfied at the vivid bite mark he left on his friend’s neck.
	The Council were gazing at him expectantly, and Hades… Hades did not object.
	It didn’t make Emet-Selch happy to hear, but it was true.
	They’d barely crossed the bridge when Emet-Selch suddenly pulled the reins short and his beast came to a halt.
	Hastily, she reaches for her notebook, where she has stored all the letters from Emet-Selch, and pulls out the first one she can get her hands on.
	“So long as it is what our friend here desires, I see no reason why we should stand in her way,” G’raha was the first to speak up, and I was glad of it, as his acceptance of Emet-Selch meant the most considering he had been the one to come to the most harm by his hand.
	“I’ve seen your bath,” Hades huffed, “It won’t fit both of us.” “I’ll adjust it,” Prometheus started to smile, leaning in close until their foreheads were touching, his hands resting atop of Hades’s thighs, his soul brushing up slow, and warm, and long against his, “Or, you can sit in my lap~” “Hm,” Hades pressed his hand against Prometheus’s chest, slowly pushing him back.
	I felt pride trickle into me from Hades as he continued to watch me in awe of my newfound passion, my eagerness to make myself, and by extension, everyone, better.
	A few of them asked her for her impression of Hades which proved far more difficult to answer considering she needs to hide their past, something she doesn’t know for how long she’ll even be able to hide.
	Hades, Emet-Selch, Architect, Ascian, Paragon of the Source, Bringer of Chaos and Summoner of Zodiark, groaned in pain.
	“You once challenged me to a duel because I told you gargoyles are a tacky aesthetic,” Hades said flatly, looking back at him.
	There's a beat of silence before you hear Emet-Selch clear his throat at your side, but when Hythlodaeus wiggles his eyebrows playfully you can't hold it in and burst out laughing, unable to stop despite Emet-Selch groaning something that sounds suspiciously like "incorrigible".
	It never lingers: it comes and goes with its bearer, as quick as he arrives and disappears, often all of the warning the Exarch sometimes has before Emet-Selch appears.
	“Traitors are unworthy of answers,” Without moving an ilm you shove back Hades’s tendrils further, stubbornness overriding lust for the moment.
	There's a short laugh and he strokes her ears as a reward as she tries to do as she's told, tries to relax as Hades' hips snap forward.
	Emet-Selch’s fingers itched from an old, ancient habit to take Prometheus’s hand in his own.
	Streaks of drying white over his belly, and smears over his thighs where Hades wiped his hands clean, contrasting against his darkly tanned skin.
	Hades looked around, counting the heads in the room.
	This has been very Emet-Selch focus but I assure you, it is the three of them together.
	A bald-faced lie, but something in it makes Emet-Selch’s features contort into sheer, utter rage.
	Hades has been planning this from the start.
	Hades, wake up.
	The instruments were rough-hewn, not a drop of varnish, but Hades approached each, a hand on his chin as he examined them all.
	And yet Emet-Selch was not one to forsake his duties for his own happiness.
	When Hades opened his eyes he found himself once again in the blinding white nothingness.
	A while later, Hades led me into an inn room we’d rented for the night.
	All of it was intimately familiar to Emet-Selch, but there was a new blanket, thick-looking and adorned with geometric patterns in muted icy tones that lay in a heap in the middle of a loud rug.
	“Palace of Authority,” Hades repeated flatly, “Really.” Hades sighed again, and muttered under his breath, “I  hate  Xerora.” “I do wonder at Elidibus’s wisdom in choosing you for this,” Hades drawled, sounding reluctantly amused, “Should I worry about your crass mouth causing a diplomatic incident?” Hades looked doubtful, “You  want  to stay in this hellhole?” Hades looked.
	“Well, this is embarrassing,” Emet-Selch said as he came to a stop at the bottom of the stairs.
	She can already imagine that accusing Emet-Selch of having his interpretation clouded by emotions of all things would get her a fierce reply, and she almost lets out a little laugh at the mere thought.
	Hades clenched his fingers over the edges of his arm rests, looking at Prometheus from the shadows of his hood.
	Hades appears too calm as he continues, which makes him appear all the more far gone and disjointed.
	"My dear, I've been around since before the lot of you invented the calendar to mark the passage of time,"  Emet-Selch replies with a scoff.
	That gunbreaker friend of yours doesn’t seem happy with you and Emet.” Ardbert pointed out while he pushed himself from off the wall to take a seat beside her.
	Hades asks, a little ragged as his movements slow once more. "
	Honestly, Hythlodaeus kind of liked the days where Hades led the audits and inspections, as he wasn’t as stern or pressuring as Lahabrea could be.
	To the matter at hand, Hades could just tell her what he knew; without the temperment of his Father rampaging at the forefront of his mind, the end of their tale in the Tempest was an obscure enough one to give him just a modicum of flexibility in the retelling.
	“I have no doubt you’ll make up for it,” Emet-Selch said affectionately.
	“...” Hades looked down at the abandoned drink.
	Not that he was fooling Hades any, but the effort counted, right?
	“Azem,” Emet-Selch called to me, sitting on my bedside and looking at me with guarded hope, and it broke my heart.
	But why prohibit Emet-Selch from fighting if he is now going to be fighting for the salvation of this world instead of its ruination?” Cyella asked.
	Emet-Selch and the unsundered ascians being a prime example.
	Her words seem to spark something in Emet-Selch as his impatience turns into outright anger.
	Strange though the connection may be, Hades sees all as you see, feels it all as you feel, with your consciousness and thoughts pressed so close to his mind.
	Prometheus’s soul was a prickly, buzzing ball of anxious energy, feeling like static electricity when Hades tried to calm it down.
	They’re suspicious of her and Hades after all.
	Hades watched as the male twin left as well, then opted to being filling his plate in the silence that followed.
	Emet-Selch is there.
	This was the tensest Convocation meeting Hades had attended in  centuries.
	“[I love you too, Hades].”  We laid in bed for the rest of the day, Hades putting off his imperial responsibilities to spend time with me.
	“This is what I get for trying to be nice?” Emet-Selch asks, a slight pout on his face.
	“Indeed, the last thing we might need is a confrontation within the infirmary,” the Miqo’te woman agreed, and Emet-Selch didn’t miss the way her eyes—unseeing though they may be—flicked to him.
	On my own, I did not  extract much information that Emet-Selch hadn’t told me himself.
	“I do think our dear familiar is in need of breakfast,” he pointed out to Emet-Selch.
	“Dost thou have unfinished business with Emet-Selch..?” He asked, casting the Ascian standing beside her a wary glance.
	Hades watches on with intrigue as you raise your eyes to meet his from over your shoulder, lips curling into a simper.
	Almost daintily, Emet-Selch wipes the blood from his lips.
	Hades’ hand slid into mine as I stood upright again.
	“Well, let us continue on our path to the Anamnesis that Emet-Selch has laid out for us.
	Emet-Selch keeps himself perfectly still in all his monstrous glory, moving you up and down instead while the strands of his aether keep filling you from both sides.
	Hades parts his mouth open with heated interest and, for how willing you are, it is naught for him to add two more to join the other—watching you cry and break under the feel of him, the sweet stretch he spreads.
	Like clockwork, each shade joked about Hythlodaeus’s health, or how Emet had to take care of his wayward lover.
	You dare call our great work  selfish?” Hades seethed as his aether began to encase her in the growing darkness.
	He was fucked  stupid,  all he could say was please, over and over, and Hades, eventually, sighed fondly and took pity on him.
	“I would have traded all of you, for him, in an instant,” Emet-Selch said very very quietly, looking back down at his friend, “Zodiark would have needed no one else, but him.” Emet-Selch abruptly stood up, and lifted his hand as if to snap.
	“Well, instead of brooding in Hades’s living room, we should do something fun, then,” Prometheus said, jumping to his feet with a sudden burst of energy, “And I know  exactly  what we can do!
	Hades tightens his hands into fists but continues to walk.
	It set Emet-Selchs nerves on edge.
	“Oh, I have an idea…” Hythlodaeus lifted Azem into his arms, then smirked and nodded in the direction of Hades’s dick.
	Something that caused her to beam in delight before she turned her attention to Emet-Selch.
	“Kiss me, Hades,” she whispered after a moment, prompting a shiver to run through my body at her use of my name.
	“Show me just how impressive you really are, oh most esteemed Emet-Selch.” With a gentle touch, Hythlodaeus tucked a strand of white hair behind Emet-Selch’s ear and whispered, “I believe a demonstration of your prowess is in order, my handsome friend.
	So apparently Hades in both his boss forms has very long hair.
	Hades watched me carefully as my mood shifted quickly.
	xD And poor Emet has to go along with her rip But don't worry, there will be some nice moments with just them two ^^ So I've been thinking and yeah, I'm going to try and end this story soon-ish and will immediately start up a second one once I figure out a nice stopping point for this story and can continue into the next :3 Don't worry, I know I said I want to focus more on Elidibus and a lot of the Eden raid things in the next story, but ultimately this is a fic about Aestelle and Emet and that isn't going to change even with Elidibus and the other Ascians showing up to cause trouble lul I just really want to have more relationships outside of only focusing on Aestelle and Emet is all (because let's be real, she was most definitely close with most of the members on the Convocation and I really need to add more moments with her and the Scions too like *there's not enough time for me to write everything I desperately want to write*) Bringing Hades to her home in Ishgard, Aestelle finds herself sitting on the floor and curled up into his side while they sit in front of the fireplace with mugs of hot chocolate, backs against the couch and sharing only small portions of what their time apart has been like since the Great Sundering.
	It takes her a long moment to find the keyhole, a gesture that makes Emet cock a brow.
	"It's alright, Hades.” A whisper from nearby as a hand rubbed up and down my back.
	My eyes flicked to the wall for a moment before back to Hades, the realization striking me that if not for the Blessing of Light, I would likely have died.
	Hades, quicker: “Prometheus!
	“Do not expect me to make time for you,” Hades mutters under his breath.
	Lahabrea is a man he will mock even after death but Emet-Selch would have never wished for it, never, not that grouchy, arrogant, ultimately brilliant colleague of his who really was an avid and passionate scholar at heart, always eager and stoically concealing his delight in the pursuit of knowledge.)
	Hades scowled, plateauing upon a long stretch of crystalline hallway.
	Hades fared little better, but remained aware enough that he, at least, could still form the words both he and Azem were thinking, “What must we do for you to remove this accursed magick?
	Hades walked with purpose towards her.
	Emet-Selch doubts he could even answer this question.
	When he begs “Please,” it’s not even asking for anything but more of whatever this is, the saturated aether that he’s breathing, that Emet-Selch is biting into his aching lips.
	Despite Emet-Selch’s insistence that his portals were leagues above Thancred’s stealth, the gunbreaker remained fast in his stance that some information was better goaded with the use of friendly conversation and a little drink.
	Gripping the chemise in his hand, Hades pulled it off over her head in a single quick jerk.
	Unlikely as it was, I couldn’t help but ask as I followed alongside Emet-Selch, trying to keep up with his languid yet steady pace, seemingly undeterred by any snow that made me stumble and catch my step.
	Clutching at the crisp white duvet, you searched Hades’ face for a hint of anything, but his expression was one of neutrality, as if he was waiting for your reaction before he unveiled his own.
	Hades scowled, “Have you told your comrades, hero?” Wrapped up in the idea of discovery, in figuring out what these dreams were, what the city was, Emet’s question was out of place and altogether brought the hero’s churning thoughts to a stumbling, tripping halt.
	Emet-Selch shrugs, “It would seem she has them often.
	“Did it work?” Hades asked.
	Much like his fosterling, Emet-Selch wanted to hate the Crystal Exarch.
	In the last moments before the teleportation spell completed, Emet could have sworn that he saw doubt on the Exarch’s face.
	Birds exploded from the nearby tree in a panic when Hades and Prometheus  screeched.
	I’m sure Emet wouldn’t mind me sharing our history either so let’s go take a seat by the fire and I’ll start from the beginning.” I'm so happy to begin writing for him like this is where everything starts following the msq while also altering the hell out of it because of Emet and just :'))) I'm excited to keep writing.~ And we also got the smol bab Unukalhai ;-; He's precious and you can bet money Aestelle is adopting him and Taynor without question xD It's going to be especially fun to write Emet having interactions with all of these characters once he's awake.
	Emet-Selch clenched his fists, his body betraying him—why was this so hard, why was he having regrets?
	Hades was  jealous , and it wasn’t a good look on him.
	Hades paused in turn, realizing what he’d just done.
	Do I have your permission to call you Hades, then?” Very well, Emet-Selch.
	Emet-Selch sucked in a quiet hiss through his teeth as he settled into place, a faint flush darkening his features as he watched G'raha sob raggedly.
	Hades wet his lips, wincing at the dryness in his throat.
	“Hades,” Prometheus whispered after an uncomfortably long pause, “You’re a  genius.”  “Well, yes, of course I am,” Hades preened - then paused, “Wait, why am I?”  Hades looked at the future Jedi Emperor.
	“Hades!” Prometheus yelled, his voice still obnoxiously loud even through several inches of durasteel, “Don’t be rude!
	(Y/N) laughed again, delight evident on her face, and Hades pulled her into his arms, peppering her neck with kisses.
	“I cannot wait to fuck you.” Hades left little kisses along her hairline, then brought his fingers to his lips, reveling in the taste of her.
	“As a disciple of Zodiark, the Ascian was the Darkness to your Light…” It was during her fight with Hades that she was forced to use the Light of the Lightwardens to make Ardberts axe into a physical weapon so she could land that final, decisive blow that ultimately resulted in her beloved’s death.
	And perhaps half, after eons of aching loneliness, is enough of a concession for Emet-Selch.
	The soft trickle of tears does not let up, and Emet-Selch joins Elidibus in kissing them away, but he has never been able to keep his hands to himself when she rests naked in front of him.
	Hades scowled, clenching his fists in his lap.
	“D-damn them…oooh…” Hades instinctively spread his legs wider when he felt Azem press against his anus.
	"Twelve, what a ridiculous outfit," he muttered distractedly, and Emet-Selch raised an eyebrow thoughtfully in response but said nothing.
	“My, my, aren’t they the little deviant…” Hythlodaeus smiled devilishly when Hades’s was eventually granted a reprieve.
	“Shall we decide another way?” Emet-Selch presented a deck of cards with one deft movement, laying the stack in her hands.
	As expected with your spotless track record.” Hades said, his voice void of amusement.
	I know that you’ve twisted my memories of the First, of him,” She jerked her head forcibly at Emet-Selch, “Of all of them.
	She should probably have expected it, but she is somewhat startled when Emet-Selch straightup laughs at her.
	Elidibus removed his mask as well, letting it rest against his hip as he looks to Hades with slightly knitted brows.
	“I’m-” When Hades paused, I followed his gaze to the Mother.
	Hythlodaeus’s hand clasps around the back of Hades’s neck, pulling him down into the semblance of a kiss that is more teeth than tongue.
	“Is that what you’ve been waiting for?” Hades asked.
	Hades scoffed, looking off to the side.
	Emet was anxious, both in the way he seemed to grasp at her any chance he got, and with the way that he no longer paid any mind to familiar faces that walked by them.
	Ghost lights, Emet mused as he walked, holding the Exarch tighter.
	In the faint shadows thrown into her room by pale moonlight she makes out Emet-Selchs form and her first reaction is a sliver of fear about having him hover so close to her.
	“Emet-Selch and I… he wanted to-”  Footsteps echoed in the eerie silence and I looked around until my eyes landed on  him  - Emet-Selch, as he was now, in his imperial garb.
	"Firstly, we need to agree on how large we will make the extension," Hades began briskly, "Some researchers have requested an outdoor area for a garden that isn't filled with man eating plants for once, so we need to divvy up our work area accordingly-" Hades paused, mentally pulling up the blueprints for Igeyorhm’s home, before he fully processed what his friend said, "Wait.
	“Perhaps you’ll actually get something accomplished,” Emet-Selch tells him smugly.
	“Hades, I can tell that something’s on your mind.
	The door stood slightly ajar and I pushed it further open, finding Hades sitting on the bed, a purple ribbon dangling from one hand, our daughter standing between his legs as he attempted to tame her wild hair.
	Emet-Selch deigned to open his eyes once more as he glared at his annoying friend, simply so that he could close them again as he let his head fall heavy onto the grass once more.
	“Emet-Selch,” Emilia ripped her blade from the ground, swinging it back upon her shoulders with the ease of a seasoned guardian.
	When Emet-Selch returns to the Source he finds the star recovering from what the people have taken to calling “Calamities”; they have just endured their third Rejoining and the land is slow to recover.
	With a resigned sigh, Hades puts an arm around him, pulling him closer.
	So glad some of you enjoyed Teacher!Emet as much as I did to write him.
	He runs a soothing hand down Emet-Selch's back, and it's a testament to how thoroughly into the throes of his heat he is that he can't think of anything but how he wants those strong hands lower, gripping his ass and spreading him open-- Azem says, fumbling his way out of his robes before dropping into bed beside Emet-Selch and mouthing at his shoulder.
	He felt a cold pressure constrict tightly around the base of his cock and suddenly Emet-Selch was astride him, the crystal restraints easily supporting the weight of the both of them.
	You do not give them enough credit, Hades, she would say.
	I saw him then, Emet-Selch.
	He put his hand on Hades’ shoulder and tipped his head forward, just enough to put his breath against the other man’s neck.
	Emet-Selch whirls into your chambers in a flourish of umbral smoke, looking dry and comfortable as he looks down at  you.
	Hades could see faint glimmers radiate across her soul; unsteady blues, greens telling of worry, fear, yellows of guilt, a twinge of oranged amusement.
	Now why would that be?” While Thancred’s hand balled up into a fist, Aestelle could only watch as Hades’ lips quirked up into just a ghost of a smirk at having finally figured her gunbreaker friend out.
	Emet told himself not to grow attached to these pointless, sundered beings, but the Exarch….
	Emet-Selch’s words didn’t seem to have much effect on the other man, as his knuckles continued to steadily rap on his chin.
	Hades didn’t seem to care, though, just gave the impression of sticking his nose up in the air and turning away, like an imperious cat.
	Emet-Selch is not drawn to her because he wants to corrupt that spirit - he happens to find it just as inspiring as the mortals on the field.
	Hades, you are no longer…” you trailed off, biting your lip.
	“Hades, I’m...” Possessiveness flares through the connection, so strong that it threatens to overwhelm you as he laps at the blood that flows forth.
	Emet-Selch, much to your dismay, treats you gently.
	Prometheus suddenly elbowed him, whispering, “Hades, look, look!” “Ugh,” Hades reluctantly lifted his head, squinting at where his friend was excitedly pointing.
	It catches their attention and Emet-Selch rolls his eyes and fixes her with a scowl.
	Emet-Selch does not deign to show you vision, of course; Light is unnecessary, it hardly has a place in such a joining.
	Her heart skips a beat when Emet-Selch’s intense golden gaze crosses her mind, but she immediately shoves it aside.
	Emet-Selch is licking the roof of his mouth and there’s more of that low, bone-shaking buzz rattling his thoughts into mist in the confines of his skull.
	“Aah, You’re awake,” A masculine voice said, and Hades turned to see a tall Elezen man standing in the doorway.
	“I would not allow myself nor any of you walk into that city with hands bound.” Her eyes shot to Emet-Selch.
	G'raha's gasp of pain was involuntary, but it was enough -- Emet-Selch's tongue slid past the bound man's lips, hot and invasive and insistent.
	Once more Emet-Selch clearly has an idea of what you’re thinking, and the hand with which he had been lazily petting Elidibus’s thigh he now slides over to take hold of his lover’s half-hard cock; his other hand he wraps around his own, and his smile is utterly wicked as he begins to stroke both himself and Elidibus in the same rhythm.
	Her red eyes glistened when she rattled off more names, watching Emet nod at each one.
	Emet-Selch raised an eyebrow at the rather diplomatic answer, paying no mind to the sensitive feelings at play.
	Hades sighed, stretching and twisting his legs, satisfied by the popping sound the bones produced in turn.
	A fitting, ugly creature for such a sickened soul,  Zodiark rumbled,  Bring him to me now, Emet-Selch.
	“We are trying to work past such misgivings, Emet, though if you’ll remember, the only interaction we’ve had with your kind has been at the other end of a blade.” Hades tried rummaging through his own memories, trying to pinpoint if something of this sort had occurred to the original Persephone.
	Your body explodes in ecstasy, your slick walls caught in helpless spasms clenching down around Elidibus’s cock; he groans hoarsely at the sheer deep pleasure of it and comes hard, once again filling your core with his cool aether, and Emet-Selch follows you both in his own release with a soft cry, slumping forwards to lean against you with his nose pressed into your hair.
	If Emet-Selch were to find a shard strong enough to regenerate Prometheus, he would only get a faulty shade, an inferior parody.
	Cupping her hands together, Aestelle let the morpho land in her palms and then slowly stood up to sit down on the edge of her bed once more beside Hades.
	You were mine  first  , Hades."
	The sky is naught but ash and brimstone and my Hades, the word is almost scribbled on the page, the ink blurred and blotched as if something wet had made the ink run.
	Hades gave me a quizzical look and I pointed to the older children gathered around his legs, marvelling as he tossed small darts to the back, accurately striking enchanted balloons with each throw.
