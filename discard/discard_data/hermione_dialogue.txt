<|endoftext|>Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example...  Oculus Reparo.  That's better, isn't it? Holy Cricket, you're Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon.  You've got dirt, on your nose, by the way, did you know? Just there.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Oh, no. Okay, relax.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I've read about those. When the smoke turns red,  it means you've forgotten something.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Up. Up. Up. Up.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry, no way! You heard what Madam Hooch said! Besides, you don't even know how to fly.  What an idiot.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The staircases change, remember?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We're not supposed to be here. This is the 3rd floor. It's forbidden.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Oh, move over!  Alohomora.  Get in.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Standard book of spells, Chapter 7.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Filch is gone.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was locked.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was standing on a trap door. Which means it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed... or worse, expelled!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Stop, stop, stop. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, you're saying it wrong. It's Levi-o-sa, not Leviosar.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Wingardium Leviosa.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Help! Help!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ahhh! Help!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Swish and flick!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Is it...dead?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...I'd probably be dead.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ron's right, Harry. You're gonna need your strength today.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Blood?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But why would anyone go near that dog?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>So you're saying...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bit early for mail, isn't it?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Leave it to me.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Lacarnum Inflamarae.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Whoo-hoo!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That thing has a name?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a spell when I see one. I've read all about them. You've got to keep eye contact and Snape wasn't blinking.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I don't know.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That's totally barbaric!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>See you haven't.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Good, you can help Harry, then. He's going to go and look in the library for information on Nicholas Flamel.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Not in the restricted section. Happy Christmas.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Look at you playing with your cards. Pathetic! We've got final exams coming up soon.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>All right, what are the three most crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And what, may I ask, do you plan to do if this comes up in the final exam?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No, you won't! Besides, according to Professor McGonagall, we're to be given special quills bewitched with an anti-cheating spell.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Follow me!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Of course! Here it is!  "Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Honestly, don't you two read? "The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It means you'll never die.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!" That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. That's what's under the trapdoor...the Philosopher's Stone!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We know about the Philosopher's Stone!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Is that...a dragon?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You mean You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hang on a minute.  We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared? Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore's around, Harry, you're safe. As long as Dumbledore's around, you can't be touched.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It's happened before.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What is it?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And with Dumbledore gone<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Uh...we were just...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Now what do we do?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this... Petrificus Totalus.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Sorry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ow! You stood on my foot!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Alohomora.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The harp. It stopped playing.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Just relax!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Do what I say. Trust me.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Are you okay?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He's not relaxing, is he?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We've got to do something!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare,  it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight!  Lumos Solem!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What is that?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Curious. I've never seen birds like these.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What's this all about?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ugh! What're we going to do? There must be 1000 keys up there!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What's wrong, Harry?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I don't like this. I don't like this at all.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Now what do we do?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What happens now?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What is it?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No, Ron, you can't!  There must be another way!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard, you really are.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Me? Books and cleverness? There are more important things. Friendship, and bravery. And Harry, just be careful.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Never better.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We're tied with Slytherin!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Come on, Harry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry! Hagrid!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Oh, it's so good to see you!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What did you do to your glasses? Oculus reparo.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ok! Bye!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Come on! Everyone's been so worried.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Fear of a name only increase fear of the thing itself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Mandrake, or Mandragora, is used to return those who have been Petrified to their original state. It's also quite dangerous. The Mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Get off me!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Immobulus!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got it on pure talent.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You okay, Ron? Say something!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He called me a Mudblood.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It means dirty blood.â Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born. Someone with non-magic parents. Someone like me. It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Voice? What voice?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry, wait! Not so fast!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The Chamber of Secrets has been opened enemies the heir beware.' It's written in blood.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That's why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor. We'd just found him when he said<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It's a bit strange, isn't it?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You hear this voice, a voice only you can hear, and then Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified. It's just strange.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Professor, I was wondering if you could tell us aboutthe Chamber of Secrets?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Muggle-borns.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>If you're talking about Malfoy.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I heard him. But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way. Mind you, it would be difficult. Not to mention, we would be breaking about fifty school rules. And, it'll be dangerous. Very dangerous.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Here it is. 'The Polyjuice Potion.'  'Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another.'<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Exactly. But it's tricky. I've never seen a more complicated potion.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>A month.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I know. But it's the only plan we've got.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No! Even with a proper wand it's too risky. You could hit Harry!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Let's go.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Finite incantatem!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Are you okay?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You will be able to, won't you?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Again? You mean the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Maybe. We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Heh No. No one ever comes in here.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Moaning Myrtle.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Moaning Myrtle.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She's a little sensitive.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Do you think he's all right?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Oh!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You can talk to snakes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No, they can't. It's not a very common gift, Harry. This is bad.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I don't know, Harry, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on, or something. Harry, listen to me. There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent. Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He could talk to snakes, too.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He lived a thousand years ago; for all we know, you could be.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Everything's set. We just need a bit of who you're changing into.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I've got it all worked out. I filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. Simple, but powerful. Now, once they're asleep hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs, and put on their uniforms.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I've already got mine. Millicent Bulstrodeâ Slytherin- I got this off her robes. I'm going to go check on the Polyjuice Potion. Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle find these.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves Add the hairs.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Cheers!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Me too.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I- I don't think I'm going. You go on without me!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Just go. You're wasting time!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Go away!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Do you remember me telling you that the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations? It was cat's hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes. Look at my face.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It can't be Hagrid. It just can't be.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Look. Hagrid's our friend. Why don't we just go and ask him about it?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody else knows our password- unless it wasn't a student.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thanks, Sir Nicholas!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It's good to be back! Congratulations! I can't believe you solved it!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Oh, no!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It's a cat, Ronald. What do you expect? It's in his nature.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That's rich... coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush. Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You know the Egyptians used to worship cats?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Good morning, Mr. Weasley.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Honestly, Ron, it's not funny. Harry was lucky not to be expelled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Come on. Everywhere else is full.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Professor R.J. Lupin.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It's on his suitcase, Ronald.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Seems to be. Why?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But they'll catch Black, won't they? I mean, everyone's looking for him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Why are we stopping? We can't be there yet.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry. Harry, are you all right?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No one was screaming, Harry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Of course. That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Just forget it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What a load of rubbish.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Me? I've been here all this time.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline. Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>A fair few.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Don't be silly Ron. How could anyone be in two classes at once? Broaden your minds. Use your Inner Eye to see the future!.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I think they're funny.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Just ignore him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hagrid! He has to be taken to the hospital.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Yeah but I heard Draco's father's furious. We haven't heard the end of this.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Dufftown? That's not far from here.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No one knows.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Boggarts are shape-shifters. They take the shape of whatever a particular person fears the most. That's what makes them so...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It's not funny, Ron.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks. We're not meant to start that for weeks.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Please, sir. An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal. A werewolf has no choice. With each full moon, when he transforms, he no longer remembers who he is. He'd kill his best friend if he crossed his path. Furthermore, the werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Go, Harry! Go, Harry!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>How are you feeling?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Umm... no one blames you, Harry. The dementors aren't supposed to come inside the grounds. Dumbledore's furious. As soon as he saved you, he sent them off.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Do you want to move a bit closer?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hope you don't mean yourself!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But Harry isn't going to keep it. He's going to turn it over to Professor McGonagall. Aren't you?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Oh, Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta. Ron fancies her.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>So rude.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ron, look! Sorry, sorry. Excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Harry, what happened?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Beautiful day.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ronald has lost his rat.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Rubbish.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Did not.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Didn't.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And then?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Oh, do you mind me trying? The Grim, possibly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You! You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That felt good.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We'll stay with you too, Hagrid.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I think that means you owe someone an apology.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I meant me!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I thought I just saw... Never mind.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ron. Ron! Ron!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry, you do realize what tree this is?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ron! Ron, wait! Harry!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Duck!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Oh, I'm sorry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Where do you suppose this goes?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ron. You're okay. The dog. Where is it?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No! I trusted you! And all this time, you've been his friend. He's a werewolf! That's why he's been missing classes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Since Professor Snape set the essay.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You attacked a teacher!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You go, I'll stay.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That looks really painful.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Wait! Wait!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Professor? Professor Lupin?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Listen Harry, they've captured Sirius. Any minute the dementors are going to perform the Kiss.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No. It's worse. Much worse. They're going to suck out his soul. Headmaster, you've got to stop them. They've got the wrong man.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The point is, we know the truth. Please believe us.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>7:30. Where were we at 7:30?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Come on. And we can't be seen.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>This is a Time-Turner, Harry. McGonagall gave it to me first term. This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Yes. Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment. Clearly, something happened he wants us to change.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thanks. Malfoy's coming.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That felt good.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Of course. Remember what Dumbledore said? If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared. Let's go.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him. Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry, you can't.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Yes, and you must! Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now. If you just go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad. Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time. We can't be seen.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Fudge is coming. And we aren't leaving? Why aren't we leaving?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Sorry. We're coming out the back door. Go!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I thought I just saw... Never mind.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Okay, go, Harry. Go!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly. Come with us now. Come on.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Keep trying. Come on. Quickly. Buckbeak. Okay? Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay? Come on. Come on, Buckbeak. Come and get the nice dead ferret. Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Come on, Buckbeak. Come on.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Buckbeak.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We save Sirius.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No idea. Look. It's Lupin.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And Snape's coming.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And now we wait.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>At least someone's enjoying himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Yeah?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>With a Patronus. I heard Snape telling Dumbledore. According to him... only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry, but your dad's... Dead. I know. I'm just telling you what I saw.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Here we come.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That's great.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry! Run!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Saving your life!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That was so scary.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>This is horrible.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry, listen to me. No one's coming.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You're dying... both of you. Harry!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But I don't like flying...!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bombarda!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We have to go.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What's he talking about, Harry?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>This came with it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>How fast is it, Harry?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Are you alright?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Just now. You?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Wake up. Wake up Ronald!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Honestly. Get dressed, and don't go back to sleep. Come on Ron! Your mother says breakfast's ready.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What??<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry it's his mark.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>This is horrible, how can the ministry not know who conjured it. Isn't there any security or?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It's hurting again isn't it, your scar.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You know Sirius will want to hear about this. What you saw at the world cup, and the dream.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Alastor Moody? The aura.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Three sir.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Because they are unforgivable. Use of any one of them will...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering him, stop it!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There's a reason those curses are unforgivable, and to perform them in a classroom. I mean did you see Neville's face.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Neville?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It's not going to work.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You see this? This is an age line. Dumbledore drew it himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>So a genius like Dumbledore couldn't possibly be fooled by something pathetically dimwitted such as an age potion.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Go on Harry. Harry for goodness sake.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We've already been through enough people why don't you just go and do it yourself? Ughh. What do you want me to say again?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ronald would like me to tell you that Seamus told him that Dean was told by Parvati that Hagrid was looking for you.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Uhhh...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Dean was told by Parvati that... Please don't ask me say it again. Hagrid's looking for you.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I'm NOT an owl!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Pssst! Harry? Is that you?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>How are you feeling? OK? The key is to concentrate. After that you just have to...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Oh um.. Sorry I'll just go.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Your wand harry! Your wand!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Boys.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Look at this! I can't believe it she's done it again. Miss Granger a plain but ambitious girl seems to be developing a taste for famous wizards. Her latest prey sources report is none other than the Bulgarian bon-bon Viktor Krum. No word yet on how Harry Potter's taking this latest emotional blow.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They're not for Ginny they're for you! Dress robes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It might interest you to know that Neville's already got someone.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Oh well spotted.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I won't be going alone because believe it or not someone's asked me. And I said yes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No of course.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She said yes??<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hot isn't it? Viktor's gone to get drinks. Care to join us?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What's got your wand in a knot?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The enemy?? Who was it wanting his autograph? Besides, the whole point of the tournament is international magical cooperation, to make friends.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>How dare you! Besides I can take care of myself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What? What? That's what you think?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You know the solution then don't you.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Next time there's a ball pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does, and not as a last resort.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Where have you been? Nevermind! Off to bed both of you.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ron you spoil everything!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry you told me you'd figured the egg out weeks ago. The task is two days from now.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I wouldn't know, we didn't actually talk about the tournament. Actually we didn't really talk at all, Viktor's more of a physical being. I just mean he's not particularly... Mostly he watches me study. It's a bit annoying actually. You are trying to figure this egg out aren't you?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I mean these tasks are supposed to test you, in the most brutal way they're almost cruel. And um, I'm scared for you. You got by the dragon mostly on nerve, I'm not sure it's going to be enough this time.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry, tell me again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The black lake, that's obvious.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Again obvious, though I must admit potentially problematic<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Look Harry, we can do this. The three of us can figure it out.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But sir, the second task is only hours away and...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Are you alright? You must be freezing! Personally I think you behaved admirably.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Next to last.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bye.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Everything's going to change now isn't it?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Promise you'll write this summer. Both of you.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry will won't you?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Oh, Harry! We've missed you! Are you furious with us, I bet you are!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Come on, inside.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Sorry we haven't written, Harry, but Dumbledore made us promise not to.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was so angry when he heard. It was...scary...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Some of the Order are following known Death Eaters, like Lucious Malfoy.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The Order of the Phoenix. Dumbledore started it last time to fight You-Know-Who. He only reorganized it after last term.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They'll have to let you off, Harry... You were defending<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Would you like a hug?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry, Ron and I, we've been named House Prefects! She hands Harry a letter.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What about you, Harry?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Are you sure? I would have thought you would get one!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I hope he's all right...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I wanted to know something about your course aims.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But surely the whole point of Defense against the dark arts is practical application?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No, but-<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But we've got O.W.L.s coming up! You expect us to do the spells with no practice?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>How can Dumbledore let that horrible woman teach? And when we're taking our OWL tests too!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Well, not us specifically, but definitely Dumbledore and the Order.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Good luck, Harry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hey, Harry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Have you seen Ron? I can't find him anywhere.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He's been acting fishy all week. He's up to something.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He's got to be taken to the hospital wing.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That old hag! She's sick!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry, I really think you should tell--<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hagrid's still not back yet. I hope he's all right.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry, you can't write to him! Owls are being intercepted, it isn't safe.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You think she's working for You- Know-Who?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I suppose so. He could have her under the Imperious Curse, though it's unlikely. Dumbledore'd know.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There we are.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Come on, I'll explain in a minute.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>These are some people I mentioned my Defense Against the Dark Arts idea with.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Obviously, this will help us pass our O.W.L.s, but more importantly, it gives us the ability to protect ourselves from...Lord Voldemort. Several people jump or wince in fear at the name.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That's true, but I think we're drifting from the purpose--<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Well...anyway...uh, I think that in order to learn properly we'll need a teacher.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>So all in favor of taking lessons from Harry?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Where are we going to meet?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ok, good.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I think we should put our names down, so we know who was here.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Honestly, Ernie, do you think I'd just leave it lying around? Besides, its enchanted.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Also, what should we call ourselves?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We'll let you know when we're going<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I think that went well.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And did you see Cho, Harry?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Well, she couldn't keep her eyes off you, could she?!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No, they couldn't have. The parchment we all signed was enchanted, like I said. No one can betray the D.A. without us knowing.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She's hurt!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry, you'd better take her to Professor Grubby-Plank. She'll know what to do.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry, are you all right?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I know something that could cheer you up.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hagrid's back!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That's got to be what Surgis Podmore was doing in the Ministry when he was arrested.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It makes perfect sense, Ron. It's got to be something the Ministry's been developing. Something top secret.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Look at this. There's been a mass escape from Azkaban.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hagrid...we've been walking for a good hour.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We won't let her!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Of course we'll help.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hagrid, I thought none of them wanted to come!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Oh, why, Hagrid? Why?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>How do you know?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>How'd Voldemort get into the Ministry of Magic without being seen? I mean, he and Sirius are the two most wanted wizards in the world...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It just seems so unlikely, Harry!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Think, Harry! Voldemort knows you! He knows you'd rush off to save Sirius.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Yes, they can, Harry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Before we do anything, we need to establish that Sirius really isn't at Headquarters. Which means we'll need to break into Umbridge's office.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Mind you, it's got to be really good!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We'll also need to keep everyone away from her office.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We'll probably only manage five minutes or so.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Break out your Invisibility Cloak, Harry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No! Please, stop!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We have to tell her, Harry...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We were trying to find Professor Dumbledore. We had to tell him...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That it's ready. The weapon.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Oh, yes. It's very well hidden.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Don't call them that!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Grawp, help us!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I thought it worked out rather nicely.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I'd imagine we should fly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There's nothing there, Harry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Well, let's try a few.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There's no one here, Harry. This isn't the right room.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry, I think we should leave.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I don't think Sirius is here.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Don't touch it, Harry!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Stupify!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Colloportus!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry, they went the wrong way!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Silenco! Stupify!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Come on, let's go in to the feast.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Take your time, Harry. We'll be here when you are.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What's that ?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Was that an owl I heard?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Really?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>A few days ago.  Though... for a bit, I wasn't sure I was coming.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She's not alone.  Even my parents -- and they're Muggles -- know something bad is happening.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There's been a lot of chatter lately.  That he's gotten... old.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>These are adorable.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>How is it Fred and George are doing it?  Half the alley's closed down.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Oh no.  Look.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But everyone got their wands from Ollivander.  Young.  Old...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Sorry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I don't know.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Stop, Harry, I know where you're going with this --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry is under the impression that Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I told you.  I don't know what I saw.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Where's Harry?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Will.  You.  Stop.  Eating!  Your best friend is missing!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Where've you been, Harry?  And what happened to your face?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What's happened to his hand?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Granger, sir.  That one there is Veritaserum.  And that would be Polyjuice Potion.  And that is Amortentia! The most powerful love potion in the world.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It's rumored to smell differently to each person, according to what attracts them.  For example, I smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and spearmint toothpaste --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Liquid luck.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>How did you do that?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No.  The instructions specifically say to cut.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Sh!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He's vile.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No I have not. And if you had a shred of self-respect you would turn that book in.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I'd like to know just whose book that was.  Let's take a look, shall we?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Why not?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The binding is fragile?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The who?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>For weeks you carry around this book, practically sleep with it... and you have no desire to find out who The Half-Blood Prince is?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Well, I was curious.  So I went to<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And... nothing.  There's no reference to the Half-Blood Prince anywhere.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What've you got there, Hagrid?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Stinksap?  You're not sick, are you?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The Aurors. I know they're here to protect us, but... somehow I don't feel any safer.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Three Butterbeers.  Splash of ginger in mine, please.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Oh, honestly, Ronald.  They're just holding hands...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And snogging.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Leave?  You can't be serious.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>So?  What if she looked over here and saw you snogging me?  Would you expect her to get up and leave?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Be delighted, sir.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What's up?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I'll get someone --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>My parents are dentists.  They tend to people's teeth.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No.  Though, a boy named Robbie Fenwick did bite my father once. Needed ten stitches.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Look at her eyes.  They've been fighting again.  Her and Dean.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>How was what?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Dead boring.  Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ol' Sluggy's having a Christmas do, you know.  And we're meant to bring someone...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Actually, I was going to ask you.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Really.  But seeing as you have such a distaste for the idea --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Don't drink that, Ron!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You could be expelled for that.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ron seems to be enjoying himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You shouldn't have done it, Harry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That was different.  It was tryouts.  This was an actual match --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You didn't put it in? Ron only thought you did?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Charms spell.  Just practicing.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>How does it feel, Harry?  When you see Dean with Ginny? I know, Harry.  You're my best friend.  I see how you look at her.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Oppugno!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes.  I really couldn't care less.  Was I under the impression that he and I would be attending Slughorn's Christmas party together?  Yes.  Of course, now, given the circumstances, I've had to make other arrangements.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Yes.  Why?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Why didn't I think of that?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Um... it's a surprise.  Besides, it's you we need to worry about. And you can't pick just anyone. See that girl over there.  That's Romilda Vane.  Rumor has it she's trying to slip you a love potion.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hey! She's only interested in you because she thinks you're the Chosen One.  You know that, right?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hm?  Oh, I've just escaped -- I mean, left Cormac.  Under the mistletoe.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I thought it would annoy Ron most. But he's a menace.  He's got more tentacles than a Snarfalump plant.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>On second thought -- maybe it'll keep Cormac at bay.  Oh no, here he comes!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You have to realize who you are, Harry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Sorry. So tell me what Arthur said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What would Draco want with a Vanishing Cabinet?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He looks different, don't you think?  Draco.  Almost... ill.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Excuse me, I have to go vomit.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Dead. Did you actually expect you could just walk up to Ol' Sluggy and ask him to reveal his deepest, darkest secret?  Honestly, Harry, sometimes I think the Daily Prophet should call you the Dim One.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You're going to have to persuade him somehow.  And now, I'm afraid, you've made it a lot harder.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That's... not possible.  No one can leave the castle these days. The Map is wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I might ask you the same.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I happen to be his... friend.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo! And for the record, I've always found him interesting.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Oh shut up.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ron.  Stop.  You're making it snow.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Um, well, she came to visit you in the hospital, you see, and you talked -- I don't believe it was a long conversation --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Does, doesn't she?  And you say you don't remember a thing from that night?  Not one thing?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Right.  Boggled...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That's Katie.  That's Katie Bell.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Well?  How do you feel?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Now remember.  Slughorn usually eats early, takes a short walk and then returns to his office.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What?  No, Harry -- you've got to go see Slughorn.  We have a plan --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry.  It's time.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>If one wants it to be.  Why?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Of course, and that explains the Vanishing Cabinet as well!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What if there are?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Dumbledore.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Strange.  Thinking this is a piece of Voldemort's soul...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>'To the Dark Lord.  I know I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret.  I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.  I face death in the hope that when you meet your match, you will be mortal once more.  R.A.B.'<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ron's okay with it, you know.  You and Ginny.  But if I were you, when he's around, I'd keep the snogging to a minimum.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We reckoned -- Ron and me.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I've always admired your courage, Harry, but sometimes... you're really thick.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You don't honestly think you can find all those Horcruxes by yourself, do you? You need us, Harry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Like that's going to happen.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Besides, he's barking.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Yes, but I'm exceptionally perceptive.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Do you think we'll ever... come back?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Coming, Mum.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Obliviate.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Goodbye.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I told you he'd take it well.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry, your eyesight really is awful.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Really?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We were friendly, not close like Harry, but --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>To Harry!  It belongs to Harry! It chose him!  It came to him in the Chamber of Secrets when he most needed it!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Where is your guard, sir?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ron!  Ron!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Shaftesbury Avenue.  I used to come here to the theater with my mum and dad.  Just popped into my head.  I don't know why...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>This way!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We need to change.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Undetectable Extension Charm.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Always the tone of surprise.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That'll be the books.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ron's right.  Cappuccino, please.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Too dangerous.  If Voldemort's taken over the Ministry, none of the old places are safe.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I've had the essentials packed for days.  Just in case.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Petrificus Totalus! Go.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She doesn't argue.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Obliviate.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Maybe you still have the Trace on you.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We didn't celebrate your birthday, Harry.  Ginny and I -- we'd prepared a cake.  We were going to bring it out at the end of the wedding...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Right.  Perspective.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Mad-eye's doing, I'd guess.  In case Snape decided to come snooping.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Homenum revelio.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It's a spell to reveal human presence.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We're alone.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry!  Harry!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ron!  I've found him!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry, you can't just disappear. We thought --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It's from your Mum.  To Sirius. Bathilda Bagshot...?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Did she now?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry.  I can imagine why you'd want to go there, but... I don't think Bathilda Bagshot is going to know where Voldemort hid his Horcruxes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Lovely.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Yes.  Question is, did he actually destroy the real Horcrux?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Maybe he knows.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But was it here?  Did you ever see it?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ron!  RON!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They have flesh memories.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Snitches.  They're never touched by bare skin until the Seeker captures it.  Even the wizard who fabricates it wears gloves.  That way, if there's a dispute, the Snitch can identify who first touched it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When Scrimgeour first gave it to you, I thought it might open at your touch -- that Dumbledore had hidden something in it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Expelliarmus!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Stop lying!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You've still got it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Well, unless one of you fancies wearing a skirt...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Remember what we said.  Keep your eyes down.  Don't speak to anyone unless absolutely necessary.  Act as normal as possible.  Just do what you see everyone else doing. We do that -- and with a bit of luck -- we get ourselves inside. And then...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Correct.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Completely, utterly, without question.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Mafalda Hopkirk, assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Office.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You're somebody.  Be careful.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Muggles.  In their rightful place.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You appear to be quite popular.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I didn't.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Try Finite Incantatem.  Of course if something's gone wrong with an Atmospheric Charm --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>This is you.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I don't like him being on his own down there.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You really have horrible teeth, you know that.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Relashio!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry... they've seen you.  We've got to get out of here.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry, quickly, in my bag, there's a small bottle labeled 'Essence of Dittany.'<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Quickly!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Unstopper it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Just do it!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We were.  We were there.  But Yaxley had hold of me.  I knew we couldn't stay once he'd seen, so when he let go I brought us here. Ron got Splinched.  I'm... sorry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It's all I feel safe doing.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Salvio Hexia... Protego Totalum...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Protective enchantments.  I don't fancy another visit like we had on Shaftesbury Avenue, do you? Especially with Ron like this. You can get going on the tent...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Repello Muggletum... Muffliato...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>How're the mushrooms?  Seem to be the only edible things growing round here.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Make sure to leave some for Ron.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He'll be alright in a few days. Hopefully.  If we could take him to Hogwarts, to Madam Pomfrey --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>So where do we go next?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It scares me a bit, that, thinking it's a piece of Vol--<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Dinner?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Tea?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I hate it.  It's like he's here with us.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Incendio!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Confringo!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What're you doing?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I can put it in my bag --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I thought it had stopped.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You can't let him in, Harry. Dumbledore himself said it.  You have to close your mind.  It's too dangerous --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Tell me. What you saw.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The wandmaker?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Viktor got his wand from Gregorovitch.  Most Durmstrang students did at one time.  What's he got to do with You-Know-Who?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Don't -- It... comforts him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I think he just hopes he doesn't hear bad news.  It gets him through the day.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We've all made sacrifices, Harry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I don't know.  It takes time.  I'm doing all I can.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Take it off.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Take it off.  Now.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Better?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It's cold.  Even though it's been lying against your skin for days.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We'll take turns.  Okay?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He could smell it.  My perfume.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I told you.  Ron's not strong enough to Apparate.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No one can conjure food out of thin air.  Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law.  The other four are --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Good plan.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>None of us do.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I don't like this place.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I want to go.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I'll tell you in a minute.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Alright.  The Sword of Gryffindor? It's Goblin made.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You don't understand.  Dirt and rust have no effect on the blade. It only takes in that which makes it stronger.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry.  You already destroyed one Horcrux, right?  Tom Riddle's diary -- in the Chamber of Secrets.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Don't you see!  In the Chamber of Secrets, you stabbed the basilisk with the Sword of Gryffindor.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Its blade is impregnated with basilisk venom.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Exactly!  Which means...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Which is why Dumbledore left it to you in his will.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Actually, I'm highly logical, which allows me to look past the extraneous detail and perceive clearly that which others overlook.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ron...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Take it off, Ron.  Please take it off.  You wouldn't be talking like this if you hadn't been wearing it all day --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry, we weren't --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I didn't!  Not like that!  Harry -- I didn't!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Stop!  Stop!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Me?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What?  Ron, no -- please --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He's gone.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It's a Muggle station.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>'I open at the close?'<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I don't know.  But look, I've found something as well...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I thought it was a picture of an eye, but now I don't think it is. It isn't a rune and it's not in Spellman's Syllabary either.  And it's been inked in -- somebody drew it -- it isn't part of the book.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What d'you mean -- wearing it?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Why would someone have drawn it in a children's book?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And it's exactly where You-Know- Who will expect you to go. Because it means something to you.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It's dangerous, Harry.  But I have to admit, recently even I've been thinking we might have to go.  I think it's possible something else is hidden there. The sword.  If Dumbledore didn't want it falling into the Ministry's hands, but wanted you to find it, what better place to hide it than the birthplace of the founder of Gryffindor himself?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry, did you ever even open A History of Magic?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Don't ever let me give you a haircut again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I still think we should've used Polyjuice Potion.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry, I think it's Christmas Eve! Listen...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Yeah. I think they would.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No.  But look.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Did you know he had a sister?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Lumos.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ignotus... Hey, Har --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Happy Christmas, Harry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Someone's watching us.  By the gate.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I don't think this is a good idea.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Muggles who've just been laying flowers on your parents' grave.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Omigod.  Harry...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry, I'm not sure about this.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There's something odd about her. And what's that smell?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You have a lovely house, Miss Bagshot.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>All right...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Why?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Confringo!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry... Harry, can you hear me...?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Good.  That's good...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I'm fine.  But you've been sick. Rest... Rest a bit more...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The Forest of Dean.  I came here once with my mum and dad, years ago.  It's just how I remember it. The trees.  The river.  It's like nothing's changed.  Not true, of course.  Everything's changed.  If I brought my parents here, they wouldn't recognize any of it.  Not the trees.  Not the river.  Not... me.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Wendell and Monica Wilkens now reside happily in Sydney, Australia.  They have two dogs, run a small sweet shop, but floss daily.  No children.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Maybe we should just stay here, Harry.  Grow old.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You wanted to know who the boy in the photograph was.  Well, I know.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was in Bathilda's sitting room. Rita Skeeter had sent it to her. Harry, it doesn't make for very nice reading --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>For a time.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gellert Grindelwald.  He's not very well known in Britain, but there was a time, before You-Know- Who...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When Grindelwald was seventeen, he was expelled from Durmstrang. He'd started doing some twisted things at school -- experiments. A few teachers had always protected him, but they couldn't anymore.  After he left, he traveled for awhile, then ended up in Godric's Hollow where his great aunt lived, Bathilda Bagshot.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She introduced him to Dumbledore. It made sense.  Dumbledore's mother had just died, Grindelwald was troubled and they were both brilliant -- they'd never really had anyone they could talk to on the same level.  They did a lot of talking that summer.  But they always returned to one particular subject.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Wizard rule over Muggles.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was something Dumbledore came up with.  He believed wizards were superior and should rule over Muggles, but gently, for their own good.  Grindelwald took a more violent position.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was a different time, Harry. It was one summer.  Dumbledore was young --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He changed, Harry.  Years later, it was Dumbledore who put Grindelwald in prison.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It's my fault.  As we were leaving Godric's Hollow, I cast a curse and it rebounded... I'm sorry, Harry, I tried to mend it but wands are different --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Maybe we can --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He loved you, Harry.  I know he loved you.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Who could look at you beside Harry Potter?  What are you, compared with the Chosen One...?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Who wouldn't prefer him, what woman would take you, you are nothing, nothing, nothing to him...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Everything all right?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You -- complete -- arse -- Ronald -- Weasley!  You crawl back here after all these weeks and say, 'Hey?' Where's my wand?  Harry, where's my wand!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry Potter, you give me my wand!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Never mind why he's got my wand --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What is that?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You destroyed it?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Don't think this changes anything.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>See me doing what things?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What happened out there?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And what may I ask did I say?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What's going on in there?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We need to talk.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>See this?  It's a letter Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald. Look at the signature.  It's the mark again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It keeps cropping up.  Here.  In Beedle the Bard.  In the graveyard in Godric's Hollow -- what?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Where?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry, you don't have a clue where the next Horcrux is.  And neither do I.  But this, this means something.  I'm sure of it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I'm always mad at him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Luna.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Do you see that?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No!  Don't go near it!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It's an Erumpent horn.  It's a Class B Tradeable Material.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Where is Luna, sir?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The what?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It's in here.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Granger.  Well... all right. There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>In time, the brothers reached a river too treacherous to pass...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It's obvious, isn't it?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The Cloak.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Its owner grew drunk with power and was murdered.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Why the Stone, Harry?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But according to the story they don't want to come back.  It's all rubbish anyway.  There's no such thing as the Deathly Hallows.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There have always been Cloaks --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Mr. Lovegood.  Thank you, sir --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No matter, sir.  We really ought to be go--<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ron!  Harry!  Take my hand!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What're you saying?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Stop it!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Penelope Clearwater.  Half-blood.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>A Stinging Jinx.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Not long.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I didn't take anything. Please. I didn't take anything.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Please! please!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry, are you thinking there's a Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Positive. Harry turns to the two wands on the table -- the ones he showed Ollivander -- and extends the longest to Hermione.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But I hate that thing -- that's the wand that killed Sirius! How can I hold it and not feel...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It is, Harry. Did Dumbledore ever say anything to you, something that might explain why --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It's perfect. Thank you, Fleur.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He's right. I was being stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It looks like it's been down here forever.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That's barbaric. I...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Lumos !<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Look.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No wonder Bellatrix thought it was real.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It's hot! All eyes turn to the bowl, WOBBLING MADLY on the floor, when... it SPLITS APART and begins to MULTIPLY.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ron, your foot!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>How're we going to reach it?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry! Behind you!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>In here!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We can't just stand here! Who's got an idea?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I've got something. But it's mad.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Relashio!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It doesn't realize it's free!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>How is it you --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You let him in! Harry, you can't --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You saw it?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Tonight? But we have to plan. We have to figure out what --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They were ready for us.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No, you'll give us away.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I know.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry! I can see you! In here!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Do you hear much from the others? From the Order?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That's Ariana, isn't it? Your sister. She's beautiful.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She died very young, didn't she.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Mr. Dumbledore... thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Did save our lives twice. Kept an eye on us in that mirror. That doesn't seem like someone who's given up, does it?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She's coming back! And she's got someone with her!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>How bad is it, Neville? With Snape as Headmaster.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They did that to you? But why?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Unless we can destroy it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You were thinking. It's Ron's idea. And it's brilliant.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Where are you going?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No. Of course not.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I'm scared.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Not this.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There he is.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He vanished. Just now. I saw it. Ron glances at MAP -- then:<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That's right. I did.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Brilliant.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Did you see where it went? The diadem!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Do we climb!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>C'mon! This way!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Someplace safe.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Where is everyone?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Where've you been?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What is it, Harry? What is it you<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I'll go with you. I/'ll --<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Yes!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I don't want you to say anything you wouldn't say if we weren't about to be killed by a giant snake! It'll just ruin it!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What's the matter with her?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Something my mum used to say.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Why didn't it work for him? The Elder wand.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Don't forget to give Professor Longbottom our best.<|endoftext|>
