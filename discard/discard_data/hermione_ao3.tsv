	Hermione screamed his name, she wanted to turn around and go back, to try and find him.
	Hermione breath hitched as she stared down at Draco's Firewhisky, watching it sway.
	Hermione rolled her eyes and returned to the conclusion.
	“We know you want to stay,” Hermione said gently.
	Hermione doesn’t really want to admit it, but it’s nice so see her…less than perfect.
	Hermione took a deep breath.
	“Don’t worry about me.” Hermione replied tersely.
	Granger did so.
	“I’ll show you tomorrow,” Hermione says quietly.
	He didn't have the faintest idea what he was doing other than making Hermione Granger laugh as the lights above sparkled in her eyes.
	Let the filth die on the island they'll just throw the bodies in the sea rather than darken Narcissa's rose garden" the door opened behind Lucius and Hermione could see the worn face of Draco illuminated in the moonlight.
	Hermione stood up quickly and rushed to him.
	Hermione had visions of Snape sitting in the Slytherin common room, teaching first-years how to smirk condescendingly.
	Bellatrix's use of her name, and the warm and husky tone of her voice, almost stopped Hermione's heart.
	“You don’t get to have everything, Granger.
	"I'm a stranger," Hermione muttered as they neared the house.
	Hermione found Snape’s cold, bottomless eyes peering down at her.
	Damn how powerful was Granger?
	Like someone had tried to understand Hermione’s style choices and decided it wasn’t the least bit trendy.
	Hermione challenged.
	Hermione watched Poppy Pomfrey as she walked with slow, heavy steps out of the hospital ward.
	Hermione: "Ouch, my hair is stuck."
	Hermione pulled Lucius’s cloak tightly around her body.
	Hermione couldn’t help but feel as though she could have done more.
	Hermione knew that.
	Hermione said fiercely, jumping to defend Harry.
	Bellatrix yelled back, but knew that she'd be doomed to end up on the ground right next to Hermione if she wasn't careful.
	Takes the glass of whisky from Hermione.
	Moody managed to get Avada out of his mouth when Hermione spread her arms open wide and a rush of air rushed from her and slammed Moody into the chair behind him and then against the wall just as the doors burst open.
	Hermione watched while Bellatrix swallowed and tried to hold onto her rapidly dissolving mask, as tears welled in her eyes, making it practically impossible.
	Hermione let out a soft sigh “Yeah.” She hadn’t lied to Hermione.
	“Well, so is soulbonding,” Hermione said in a tight voice, she waved her wand and banished all the scrolls into her trunk before Ginny could read more.
	He had made Hermione’s Potions NEWT exceptionally difficult, harder than any NEWT he had ever administered before.
	Hermione corrected with a frown.
	Severus guided Hermione over to the almost empty bench of the Ravenclaw table and forced her to sit down before he stalked to where Potter was standing, trying to stammer out an excuse.
	Hermione glanced out the window and spotted Severus talking to Molly.
	Hermione also knew that by having her perform the spell for part of the group, Tom was proving a point, making her just as responsible for their actions as he was.
	He stood and took another step towards Hermione.
	Don’t push me, Hermione, to ‘open up’ to you.
	"It sounds more like a nickname you use for a lover," Hermione pointed out and Harry laughed, even as his ears went red.
	Hermione felt her father's hand on her shoulder, and she blinked away the tears of homesickness that were preemptively building.
	Hermione stared at Pansy with irritation.
	But then she looked into his face, and Hermione felt cold terror trickling through her limbs.
	“Tom!” Hermione had turned, and rushed toward him, looking him over for damage.
	Hermione glanced down to see his face, flushed pink and wet from nose to chin before he wiped his mouth and licked his fingers.
	With a singular purpose, Hermione laid her hand on the floo and sent her magic into it, barring everyone from entering her rooms via the floo.
	Hermione lifted her palms to her face as the noise reverberated in the large open living space.
	Hermione didn't say anything for a moment, but held on to the thought.
	Pulls out her wand, from where it was lost under the cover near Hermione.
	"So, as I was saying, Hermione was trying to free my arm while the toad was just sat there, basically being a great big giant toad.
	Hermione replies bluntly.
	He'd expected them to go after recent memories of Hermione, questioning the truth of his relationship with her, or to go through the past few years, looking for any evidence that he was returning to Dark magics and companions.
	Hermione was off of the couch and out of the house before anyone could stop her.
	Hermione proclaimed, raising her eyebrow as though to suggest Ron was wrong to even suggest that she had.
	Tom released Hermione’s hand and took Abraxas’s instead, pulling his hand behind him, and placing it over his own cock.
	"He is a very smart man," Addie said, her smile sharp and red and knowing, "but to continue our previous line of conversation, I had a little discussion with dear Sabine earlier and she informed me that there is talk of dear Hermione being elected as the British Youth Representative to the Wizengamot."
	“Please Hermione!
	“Every morning, as I do my morning ablutions, I shall praise Hermione Granger and her contingency plans.
	Black sounded grumpy, but there was an amused lilt in her tone that had Hermione glancing over at the back of the sofa.
	"Granger," he warned, grinding into her so she could feel his hard cock between her soft arse cheeks.
	Hermione watched them leave and bit her bottom lip.
	The warmth of a light blush touched her cheeks, but Hermione did not lose her composure because of it.
	Hermione asked.
	Hermione suddenly felt like she was being cornered, as if he would pounce on her if she made any sudden movements.
	Hermione firmed her jaw and aimed her wand at John, her face a picture of determined concentration.
	Make me come!” Hermione pleaded and began to grind her clit against his fingers still resting on her core.
	Hermione asked.
	Ginny had respectfully not inquired about her physical relationship with Snape again…and Hermione hoped she would be able to sort all of that out in time.
	Hermione instantly froze, her eyes going wide.
	Hermione didn’t go inside, but she knew that if there was a bath inside, she was fully prepared to utilize it to the fullest.
	Malfoy's eyes traveled slowly across the unit, landing on Hermione's.
	Hermione cleared her throat.
	Not Hermione.
	Hermione ran her eyes to the top left hand corner.
	"Besides, I won't be alone," Hermione started as the three of them moved towards the gift shop.
	Hermione was his friend and it wasn't that he didn't realise she was a girl, it was just…she was his friend and why would she be interested in him, he concluded with a fair amount of confusion.
	There wasn't enough lust potion on the planet to make Hermione interested in a centenarian.
	“It’s not funny, Ron,” Hermione says, wrinkling her nose.
	Granger Potter," Draco said, gesturing to Mia.
	Hermione flinched back r, shying away from the older girl before looking down at what she'd just been handed.
	"Hermione," Harry called, his voice pulling her out of her thoughts like a rescuer, "Did you know about this?"
	What worked for her wouldn’t work for Hermione.
	asks Hermione tersely.
	"Do you feel me, Granger, do you feel me stretching your pussy?
	He leaned in and suddenly Hermione felt him press his lips to her neck.
	"I don't have anything else in me," Hermione said.
	Like when Hermione had saved Sirius and Buckbeak – nothing looked like it had changed to anyone else.
	Hermione snarled.
	He found a spot in her arse that made her see stars, and Hermione floated into orbit.
	Hermione just gaped at him for a few seconds.
	"She asked how Hermione enjoyed her birthday, and he drunkenly blurted out that Sirius and Remus have been shagging her for years."
	Hermione watched as Narcissa, moved toward Draco, asking him to identify them.
	Hermione and Ginny had gotten close after sharing dorms for their last year of Hogwarts, as Hermione had been the only Gryffindor “eighth year” girl to come back to school.
	Instruction one: Speak the following words — "Daphne, this is Hermione, I have found the step by step instructions."
	“Hermione, wait!
	Hermione smiled, a blush creeping across her face.
	"Oh please," Hermione said, annoyance clear on her face.
	Hermione tried to suppress it as much as possible, tried to calm herself down before she lost hold of herself, but it was proving to be more and more difficult by the morning of the seventh day.
	“Yes,” Hermione whispered back.
	Hermione smirked at him, “Have you forgotten?
	Hermione pulled her shirt back on and went over to her bed and stared at the calendar beside it.
	Hermione, Lucius and Draco, were the only ones that stood beside her.
	Hermione's voice asked.
	Hermione and Remus had become nearly inseparable; he liked having someone his age to talk to about books and potion theories.
	The papers were scrambled and the hat handed to Hermione for picking.
	Hermione seemed thoughtful for a moment.
	Enraged that she was being showed up by a ruddy bird of all things, Hermione sent a reducto flying it’s way.
	Hermione glared over her shoulder just in time to see an unfamiliar brown owl approaching their flat with a letter tied to its foot.
	Hermione: "I didn't realize you cared about this, Malfoy.
	I want her transferred to Sussex, next batch they ask for, top of the list, for Dolohov personally.” She leaned closer to Hermione, and her voice was almost a whisper.
	Hermione alone in this house.
	Hermione had thought she knew what attraction was.
	"So, Granger was interrogated today," Tonks said and Charlie made a rough sound at the back of his throat.
	Now, he wanted to feel Hermione, to feel their bond explode with sensation and love.
	Hagrid led them out into the Hall and Hermione got up to help the teachers as Head Girl.
	Hermione told him, rolling her eyes.
	We can hammer out the details later.” Under his breath he whispered, “Hermione Malfoy-Snape.” “Hermione Snape-Malfoy has a much more commanding presence to it, don’t you think?” “How about Draco Malfoy-Granger?” Draco murmured, still nuzzling her neck.
	Hermione took a deep inhale of its pages and she immediately felt her nerves settle.
	Luna asked, quiet but curious, as they entered the bedroom they had both slept in after the Quidditch World Cup, the room at the Malfoys that Hermione now privately thought of as hers.
	We have to get what we came for, Hermione.” When the woman indicated with a gesture that she wanted to see Harry alone, Hermione knew for sure.
	Hermione stepped up close to him, wrapping her hands around his tie and tugging him down.
	Hermione blamed her pregnancy for the oversight.
	Hermione sipped her champagne and smiled as Arthur stood and cleared his throat.
	“Ah, yes,” Dumbledore’s eyes fell on Tom, Hermione, Abraxas, and Patience, who were standing in a cluster to the side, then flicked to Marguerite, sitting at Sebastian’s side across the room.
	Today was not that day, however, and she was determined to show Hermione what she could do to the point of making her head explode.
	Always right, Hermione thought, the words weighing on her heart.
	Hermione led them to a patch of ground that remained within eyesight of their camp, but far enough that Harry could just glimpse a church spire over the swell of the heath.
	Hermione whispered into her ear peace.
	Hermione walks over to the bookshelf to grab some more rolls of parchment.
	Hermione’s eyebrows furrowed with surprise.
	Hermione waits, as though she still has something left to say, but then she lets out a breath and says simply, "I'll see you at dinner," and leaves.
	If Ginny had been standing near a wall, Hermione was sure she'd have headbutted it, such was the level of the 'facepalm' expression on her face.
	And by the time he pulled out the Portkey, barely holding her forearm between his thumb and forefinger as they landed in a silent alley in Muggle London, Hermione was wondering if she'd miscalculated.
	Hermione reached out to him and pulled him to her guiding him to wrap his arms around her waist as she continued to hug Draco.
	When the clock struck noon, Hermione stood, too afraid to even breathe as she watched the minutes continue to creep by.
	Draco, and Daphne, and Hermione, and Theo, and Pansy."
	Hermione had rounds with Pansy the next night.
	Hermione shook her head.
	Hermione gave him a surprised look.
	Hermione brings a hand to her chest.
	Bellatrix lunged for him, barely hearing Hermione’s gasp of horror.
	Hermione explained, with a snort.
	Ginny was waiting up when Hermione returned, watching her with a shrewd expression.
	"Hopefully better prepared," said Hermione.
	And Hermione shuts the door in her face with a chuckle and a muttered colloportus.
	Snape took a step back away from the glass and began to walk a slow circle around Hermione.
	Hermione rolled her eyes.
	“Yes,” Hermione said stiffly.
	"Trust the evidence, Miss Granger," he said.
	“And I assure you Draco knows some truly stellar hexes,” Hermione said, laughing along with him.
	Hermione reached out to him.
	"Well, congratulations, Granger," said Draco, crossing his arms while standing close to her.
	Galatea performed Hermione’s spell with her wand, carefully undoing and redoing the spell, and as the books moved around them, she put her strong, warm hands on Hermione’s shoulders.
	Turning to Hermione, Sirius whispered, “I like her.
	"That's not me, Granger."
	Sirius had not seen the owner of the large orange cat yet, but the Weasley boy was always whinging about "Hermione and her bloody cat" going after "poor old Scabbers."
	Hermione muttered sheepishly.
	On the morning of the 31st, Hermione met Narcissa for a quick breakfast.
	Or the Snape who had sent Hermione crying to the Hospital Wing with oversized beaver teeth in her fourth year.
	Harry doesn't look at all surprised to hear the news as Granger launches herself at him and gives him the strangling Draco narrowly avoided.
	Her eyes snapped open to find Dolores Umbridge’s face merely inches from hers, studying Hermione with vicious glee through the bars of the cage.
	Hermione swallowed.
	"I'm very wise," Hermione mumbled back, commandeering Ginny's beer once and for all and letting the tip of her tongue linger at the lip of the glass bottle.
	"Granger, every eye will be on you next week.
	Harry was kind of miffed because he'd lost to Hermione at the last second with 'What is the name of the orphanage Tom Riddle grew up in?'
	"You know we'll need someone to get us into that party," Hermione said in disbelief.
	Hermione smiled at him.
	Hermione's smile brightened.
	asked Hermione.
	she scoffed, flicking her eyes over Hermione once more.
	Snape swept past Harry, making no comment about Hermione's empty seat and cauldron.
	So, he stood up next to Hermione and waited, quietly listening to the loud, wailing noise of the klaxons and sensing the disruption in the wards as the inferi fled from the Manor via the underground tunnels.
	Hermione glanced at Harry for confirmation before replying.
	Hermione sat on the bed completely defeated, wondering if the basilisk had taken her down as quickly as this little elf.
	There is no way forward, Hermione thought, bitterly.
	“Oh, thank you,” Hermione blushed.
	At around six o’clock that evening, Hermione stood in the dining room, putting the finishing touches on the simple lamb-and-rice dish she had ordered the elves to prepare for supper.
	“Thank you, Ginny,” Hermione said, smiling slightly.
	After borrowing Patience’s bracelet and grabbing the small, charmed mirror Narcissa had given her shortly after they’d arrived in the past, Hermione went to the bathroom entrance to the Chamber and made her way down alone.
	Later that day, as Hermione walked to the private dining room Lucius had booked for their dinner in the administrative wing, she smoothed the simple Muggle-style sheath dress she was wearing.
	I heard you found my bedroom, Granger.
	Except, he knows Hermione always acts in his best interests, even if she can be a pain in the arse at times.
	Hermione bit her lip and shrugged, looking back at her work.
	Hermione was laughing and Bellatrix looked wild and joyful; a far cry from previously.
	The door swung open on well-oiled hinges and Hermione froze as soon as she met her grandmother’s vexed stare.
	"Ron, for heaven's sake," Hermione said, stumbling a little as she stared after Draco.
	Hermione had disapproved of the girls' choice at the time, but now she understood how empowering it could be to choose when and with whom you first had sex.
	Hermione’s eyes drew upwards.
	If he could be mature and open enough to just disclose some of what he was feeling, Lucius would take it for the accomplishment it was and give Hermione more sexual freedoms, so they could move their relationship along.
	Hermione looked between them, puzzled.
	Hermione stared at the crinkled corner of the Prophet, thinking of Cho and Katie Bell and those who would get no obituary in their paper.
	Hermione crawls back.
	Hermione stares at him for a long, hard second, her gaze fierce and a little uncomfortable.
	Hermione reaches up to rest a hand on Narcissa’s shoulder.
	Hermione slowly pulls back…and looks up at Bellatrix.
	Ron stared at Hermione as she slumped against the wall.
	Hermione’s brows furrowed.
	Hermione lifted her wand, slightly, and pointing it at a downwards angle, aiming it at his chest.
	Both Insignificant things, really… Hermione snorted and rolled her eyes.
	Hermione watched them slip Harry's glasses onto the boy's nose, and remove the body from the Hall.
	Her blood was on fire as Riddle’s fingers trailed along the skin between her breasts; she arched her back pleadingly and Riddle obliged, his hand slipping beneath the fabric of her dress and edging towards her nipples—his hips ground into hers and he was irrevocably hard—he pulled his lips from hers to kiss her neck, ravaging her throat, and Hermione threw her head back and moaned— Riddle released Hermione and had his wand drawn, holding it at the ready before Hermione could even see straight.
	He glanced at Bellatrix just in time to see her, pressed flat against the ground, shimmy forward toward Crookshooks who still wound his way through Hermione's legs, purring.
	Hermione stares back.
	Harry knows that however much Hermione tries to persuade him and Ron out of going to meet this mysterious ‘friend’, they’ll still go – and they both know that if they don’t, Hermione will probably sneak out by herself and go alone.
	I really just wanted to focus on Harry and Hermione's dynamic before bringing Luna into the fold.
	Crookshanks took this moment in time to wander into the room and for a minute Hermione was tense, thinking they wouldn’t get along.
	It was very light, and Hermione thought it must be a hairpin or a piece of jewelry to be in such a small box.
	Hermione would pet his arm until she got groggy, and he’d watch her in the dark, her fluffy head perched on Snape’s chest.
	Hermione looks around.
	Topsy appeared with broth and potions, which she entreated Hermione to try to keep down.
	“What about penetration?” Hermione wasn’t sure about that.
	He finished his cigarette and dropped the end into the firepit, taking his seat beside Hermione.
	She wishes Hermione was here.
	Hermione still can’t quite believe she’s talking to Tonks.
	Hermione learned what she needed to and bought everything else, unconcerned with the cost.
	“Did you two already exchange gifts?” Remus prompted, and the knowing smile he gave Sirius told Hermione that they had already talked about the bike.
	Hermione looked skeptical.
	His eyes swept along the walls and alighted at the spot where Hermione was huddled.
	Hermione had to will herself not to shudder.
	"I believe you owe me a favor, Miss Granger."
	“It’s my bracelet,” Hermione said, continuing to search as she spoke.
	Hermione stopped about three feet away and gave him a small smile.
	"So, Granger actually refused to say?
	Hermione snapped her head and looked at the older wizard with wide eyes.
	Hermione found herself slipping more often than she liked, the only thing keeping her from falling being her quick thinking and careful foot placement.
	Harry asked, leaning out of his bed as Hermione slipped through the door to the infirmary.
	Hermione's breath was short as she imagined it.
	“This.” Hermione turned the book around to face him.
	"No need to apologize, miss Granger," said the professor as she strode inside, closing the door behind her.
	Hermione looked down in a submissive gaze to the floor.
	Hermione watched as a pensive look grew on Lucius' face.
	‘For a muggleborn, Hermione’s a great teacher’  ‘Hermione’s so good in all her classes despite growing up with muggles’ She would be labeled everything else before she could simply be Hermione Granger; brightest witch of her age.
	Hermione felt the same feeling whenever she teleported into a Black holding: first the thoroughly unpleasant sensation of being forced through a narrow tube, followed by the odd sensation of being pushed through a thick layer of sticky-toffee pudding.
	Severus was finishing prepping everything they would need when Hermione joined him.
	And what it told Hermione about her own was undeniable.
	Hermione leaned a cheek comfortingly against his shoulder, letting out a hushed, nostalgic sigh.
	Ginny, following Hermione's eyes, gulped.
	From Tom, Hermione had received a necklace– a "choker", to be precise, which Harry thought was a fairly accurate representation of the pair's sex life.
	Hermione shrugged.
	Heels, Granger.
	She grabbed Hermione's hand and shook it hard.
	Hermione bolts up in bed.
	Pairing: Krumione (Viktor Krum x Hermione Granger) You look lovely dear, the mirror squeaked, and Hermione almost believed it, trying not to run her fingers too many times through the rarity of her silkily tamed curls.
	Hermione, will you come support us?"
	So, Hermione had been absolutely right.
	Hermione hissed when her head felt like it was about to explode.
	When Barty first brought him news of Hermione, he wanted to dismiss the notion of a Life Elemental.
	The ensuing chaos as Potter broke open the packet and the Chocolate Frog made a heroic bid for freedom caused a certain amount of commotion that Hermione likely would have preferred not occur on a Muggle train, but was frankly unavoidable.
	"Hermione," he said in a soft voice.
	Hermione sat in the shadows of a small alcove, her knees brought to her chest as she sobbed into her folded arms.
	Hermione knew she was teasing her still, but she replied all the same.
	She didn’t get a chance to speak before Hermione gave her a wicked grin, “I have a proposition for you, Rita, I heard you’re interested in writing a book...” Hermione almost thought she saw Rita’s antennae twitch and the lustful gleam at being able to get a peek at intimate details of one of the most enigmatic wizards known.
	Hermione pulled the doors open, finding hangers upon hangers of clothing — an extension charm widening and deepening the space.
	There was a war coming and Hermione was going to be an important piece to win it.
	And as a clap of thunder sounded above them all, Hermione knew it had begun.
	Hermione opened her mouth to protest, but Pansy was already coming at her with the brush.
	Hermione smiled to herself, steadied and kept walking.
	Ron had the large Weasley clan, but Hermione was an only child and she and Harry had become surrogate siblings since their first year at Hogwarts.
	Mister and Mrs. Granger held an exhausted Clare steady between them.
	He wonders which of them is still alive, but he doesn't want to ask anything which might be too personal – which is a touch bizarre, Harry allows to himself, given Hermione knows all of his family history pretty much.
	McGonagall asked, turning back to her after nodding briskly at Moody, and Hermione shook her head.
	He looked rather too unnervingly like a statue for a moment, reminding Hermione of the marble figures from the fountain in the park.
	Hermione was glad to see that Harry didn't look angry still; time seemed to have let the flames of his temper burn off rather then fanning them.
	Hermione shakes her head.
	Hermione: "Um, so."
	“And you, Miss Hermione?” They offer out their other hand.
	Hermione blinked and looked around.
	Daphne would have made the most popular girls at Carondelet look like absolute trolls, and yet she was far kinder than any of the girls Hermione had gone to high school with.
	Hermione jumped, and the Scottish girl's hands dropped quickly.
	Hermione smiled, remembering the one glimpse she'd had of Madam Pince during the Battle of Hogwarts.
	Both Lucius and Hermione glanced down at Hermione’s left hand.
	He glanced over at Hermione.
	She was an insufferable student to teach.” Snape walked over to survey Hermione, who was still strapped down on the table.
	A nauseating sense of pain and rage welled up in Hermione’s chest every time she thought about it.
	"And ex-lover is a bit... we never..." Hermione sighed and shook her head.
	Hermione follows the thread back in.
	Hermione took in the look of Bellatrix, her pale skin a bit reddish in the face from the cold: the curly-haired witch looked beyond stunning, and Hermione always got this strange, warm and fuzzy feeling in the pit of her stomach whenever she saw Bellatrix's face in the pool after a long day of school.
	The woman was even more intoxicating now than she had been before Hermione had known what she sounded like with her fingers inside her; before she knew how she felt when her mouth was on Hermione and coaxing her into an earth-shattering orgasm.
	Hermione gestured to his leather jacket and trousers.
	Mr. Granger smiled and looked him straight in the eyes.
	That was what frustrated Hermione so much about the process.
	Hermione felt a warm flush in her cheeks but gave up the bag without pretense.
	She'd initially paused because she couldn't pick a word - she was waffling between prattish and gangly and lame - but then felt her priorities shift abruptly as she caught a shared glance between Weasley and Granger; it was a look of such open detest that Pansy, from a distance, delighted in the candor of it.
	At breakfast, Hermione received another owl from Dumbledore.
	He could swear that boy smelled different when he’d been under Nanny Granger’s care, like a sweet shop that specialized in candy cum and pheromone-laced chocolates.
	"You know, people usually wait for a response to a knock before entering, Granger."
	“Some very strong tea would be lovely,” Hermione sank into one of the chairs by the fireplace and pointed her wand to start a roaring fire.
	Hermione watches intently.
	Hermione shook her head but pulled her friend in for a hug.
	Hermione and Ron turned accusing eyes on Harry who held his hands up.
	Maybe they have some idea what’s going on with that, because Hermione doesn’t.
	Hermione looked at Severus and he gave a quick sideways glance at the newlyweds.
	“That’s…that’s my flatmate,” Hermione manages to get out as Bellatrix takes the helmet off.
	"You should, Granger."
	"Oh, I don't know why he does it," Hermione sighed, bending to kiss his cheek.
	Harry, Ron, and Hermione went out to find the other Horcruxes.
	Hermione’s stomach twisted, roiling at the thought.
	Hermione frowned.
	"I have to finish an essay Harry," Hermione said standing up from the wall.
	As Hermione put the finishing touching on her make up that evening, she replayed her audacious conversation with her best friends that afternoon in her mind.
	“Did you hear, Hermione?
	Dominants in the magical world often offered healing after significant punishment scenes, it was very rare for new or training submissives to opt for what Hermione had.
	Everyone began digging into their pudding save for Hermione, who was staring at Sirius in confusion.
	Hermione’s mouth falls open.
	Hermione scowled at the scene.
	“I want to please you,” Hermione whispered, still staring down at the ground.
	Meanwhile Hermione had crawled under the covers.
	"Or rather, good yesterday to you Miss Granger."
	Hermione’s hold on her spoon tightened, and her jaw twitched.
	Hermione gave him a sharp look and he quickly added, "um, sir," with a light blush.
	Remus looked at Hermione, noticing how on edge she appeared.
	People clapped and cheered, but Hermione wasn't one of them.
	Remus rolled his eyes but leant forward and lifted Hermione gently into his arms, her bent knees hanging over his left forearm while his right cradled her shoulders.
	Hermione looked up at her and she was smiling.
	On this particular day, Hermione had taken refuge at her favorite spot at the window because the headache eating away at the back of her mind was causing an indescribable amount of pain; the one responsible not caring in the slightest about her obvious discomfort.
	Hermione swallowed down another sip of wine, her glass now only half-full.
	Hermione snapped it on as they walked, her mind still lost among the journals.
	"Hermione Granger."
	Hermione stops kicking.
	Lucius and Draco camped out in the waiting room while Hermione and Severus sneaked up to the second floor, both of them disillusioned to avoid being detected by any nosy medi-staff.
	Hermione's jaw fell as her eyes shot up to Lucius'.
	“Sorry, Hermione!
	Her indignance over Hermione seemed to manifest in whatever strange way she thought she could get away with it.
	"We took the Knight Bus," Hermione mumbled, her polite smile breaking.
	"You made a choice, Miss Granger, and there is nothing more or less to it than that."
	One of the Italian prosecutors cast a glance at her, and Hermione tried to focus on anything but her nerves.
	Finally, Hermione shifted and slowly moved to stand.
	She brushed her fingers against the nape of it now, feeling the soft curls that were all that remained of the Granger mane.
	Hermione turned and could vaguely make out two large men standing behind Stroud.
	"Hermione?"
	“Yes…” Hermione replies questioningly.
	Hermione folds her arms.
	The Patriarch of the Black Family was staring at Hermione as though he’d just been smacked in the face with a beater’s bat.
	Hermione asked.
	Harry nods, his jaw tight, because he knows Hermione wants to say something else, and he knows he won't like it.
	Hermione sniffs.
	They eat their breakfast rather quickly after that, and then Hermione suggests taking food to Harry for when his practice lets out.
	Hermione closed her eyes and whispered.
	And Hermione could hear Madame Michele’s voice in her head regarding difficult guests.
	Hermione looked over at Bellatrix after a moment, her fingers playing nervously with the cup in her hands.
	Hermione cleared her throat and then straightened her back.
	Harry studied Draco, who was still watching Hermione and Krum.
	Hermione shook, but held still.
	Hermione smiled at Lavender, who looked genuinely surprised by her gentle touch.
	Hermione rolled out of the wet spot and shimmied up to his chest, where she rested her cotton-filled cranium.
	Hermione draws her own wand, wide eyes searching out Harry and Ron.
	Hermione ran a hand through her hair.
	Fine, Hermione.
	Hermione stood slowly and approached the intimidating woman.
	He had his eyes on the back of Hermione's head, on the long curls draping around her shoulders.
	Ron was asking, huffing as they tried to get him out, "Did I push Hermione out of the damn way?"
	Hermione closed her eyes and eagerly awaited lips on hers.
	“You’re beautiful,” Hermione says.
	Something in that statement made Hermione giggle and relax a bit, but Tom was not sure what.
	Hermione and Ginny both stared at him.
	Weasley said, and it was Harry who spoke up first as Hermione had to take a moment to process what the man had just said.
	Kingsley: "Okay, so let me get this straight: your department doesn't do anything at all, except for a weird loophole Miss Granger found in an old contract containing a clause that enabled her to take complete bureaucratic control of Hogwarts."
	Hermione returned to Diagon Alley the next day and spotted the Daily Prophet.
	Molly Weasley was blind to all this, of course, insisting that Hermione should join Arthur and her for a visit to Ireland.
	Hermione looked quickly away.
	The older siren trailed soft kisses up and down her neck, letting a purr rumble in their chest that made Hermione want to melt right there on the spot.
	Patience sighed, her breath warm on Hermione’s clavicle.
	But, for now, this could be exactly what Harry and Hermione are looking for."
	Turning deliberately fast so that her hair smacked him in the arm, Hermione headed into the greengrocer.
	He darts a look at Hermione but she’s already enthralled in her own reading.
	Because Hermione was many things, but a fool wasn’t one of them.
	"Sorry, Granger," she said quietly.
	“Mmm, so Hermione, we are sharing dreams and from the one, we just experienced we will need to be having a conversation soon, very soon.
	He hadn't had many means by which to investigate whether the smell was a Granger thing or a Muggle-born thing.
	It was only when Ginny came through Hermione felt the desire to talk with the new ones.
	Remus asked, still shocked that Harry and Hermione's group had been discovered.
	"Hermione?"
	Snape looked at Draco questioningly, clearly wondering if Hermione had said the same about him.
	Alerted to the danger by the taunts of the Potter Alliance attacker, Harry once again played rescuer along with the Weasleys' youngest son Ronald and school friends, Hermione Granger and Neville Longbottom.
	Hermione nodded.
	Hermione asked, her ears perked in curiosity.
	"The type of deal I am referring to, Miss Granger, is that you will not be disappearing off again.
	“Sirius trusts her,” Hermione snaps.
	Mr. Granger smiled.
	Hermione: [shrugging] "Yeah.
	Hermione stops.
	Things are going to be hard enough even if she is willing to accept your relationship with Hermione."
	Zabini clears his throat, and Hermione and Ron both turn to glare at him.
	Lucius watched her go, then turned back to a stunned Hermione and Snape.
	Katya's eyes flickered over to her, and Hermione quickly looked away.
	I’ll bet you do, Hermione thought grimly.
	“Put your leg over Hermione’s hip.
	She was capable of fixing this, even more than Hermione could and she chose not to.
	After leaving one Slytherin compartment, Harry ventured into another, smiling when he caught sight of Hermione sleeping on the train with an open book, and her fat kneazle, in her lap.
	Hermione jumps in surprise and shoves herself back from Fred.
	Hermione chuckled at their petulance.
	Hermione found herself wishing that she had her enchanted purse with her.
	Hermione had thought it was simply because he was doing as ordered, but she was beginning to strongly suspect his attention went beyond that.
	Before he had time to dwell on that unwelcome thought, Hermione reached into her bag and pulled out a box wrapped in sliver paper with a red bow.
	Alicia barks out a laugh from beside her, and Hermione blushes.
	He would visit, but would either brood or insult Hermione.
	Hermione had listened to him complain a little before the end of term but he hadn't wanted to fully unload on her, too aware that she had formed a close friendship with Sue over the second task.
	You are freaking out because Sirius died, and Hermione and I were injured, and you think it's all your fault.
	He thought about how she was in sepia and gray, here, just like in the pictures in the pages of Hermione's books.
	"I'm sure they're useful in some way," Hermione said, though she didn't seem to believe her own words.
	Hermione put her arms around his neck.
	It flared and became ash in between his hands, and Hermione realized just how much elemental fire magic he had been practicing on his own.
	"Granger."
	When he brushed his foot over what he thought was Hermione's ankle, Charity snorted.
	Hermione gave him a curious look.
	He moved as if he wanted to sit up, but Hermione put her hand on his chest to keep him in place.
	Hermione asked quietly.
	It was nearly a half hour later that they finally left Hagrid's hut, Hermione beaming and waving with her free hand at Hagrid as she promised to visit again soon.
	“I like Quidditch just fine!” Hermione yelled over the crowd.
	Hermione pouted again.
	Hermione can’t decipher…a single word.
	beautiful,” Hermione sputtered.
	Hermione spun around, the sheared layers of her skirt flaring out below the knees where her mermaid dress loosened into floaty ripples.
	“And trust me, Granger.” He smiled at her.
	For the second time that night, Hermione contemplated murdering her best friend.
	Hermione wondered if this were only for Dumbledore, or if she was always a bit sad when the students left.
	"Well almost, we go to the funerals first though," Hermione muttered, the chill sneaking back into her heart, "Good two weeks of them—."
	“What did you do to me?” Hermione knew that something was wrong.
	Hermione is on her knees beside him, and it takes Harry too long to realise she must have taken his glasses, because his vision is fuzzy, and his scar is prickling.
	The group all grinned and started discussing decorations, but Hermione was still locked on the older woman.
	Mad-Eye Moody procured an unspecified amount of genetic material from Bellatrix Lestrange—no one had any desire to ask how—and Remus Lupin revealed that the Order kept an impressive reserve of Polyjuice in the attic at Grimmauld Place—although, Hermione noticed, he was oddly reticent when she inquired about its origins.
	Hermione had been quizzing her on the curriculum standards for weeks.
	Fred asked Hermione, his hand coming to rest on her hip.
	Luna then reached over to pat Hermione's hand.
	Neither Tom nor Lady Bonneau had shared the details of what had happened at Malfoy Manor other than to say that there was no immediate danger of discovery or retaliation over his marriage to Hermione.
	Pansy left, and Hermione tried to wait.
	Fleur’s reaction to Hermione had been stunning.
	"Nott," Hermione groaned.
	Once he'd closed the door behind him, Hermione stood and stretched, arms high overhead before sweeping down to brush her fingers over the thick pile of the carpet.
	Ginny, to Hermione’s surprise, ended up being an extremely supportive research partner.
	Hermione nodded soundlessly; she hadn't spoken since Moody had put her under the Imperius, and she felt too simultaneously raw and yet numb to start now.
	Lucius had been somewhat surprised when the house-elves had informed him that morning that Hermione had flooed back to Hogwarts.
	"Perhaps we should, um," Hermione stood abruptly, overwhelmed.
	His expression looked as close to hurt as Hermione had ever seen it.
	She grabbed Harry’s arm and dragged him past Hermione.
	"Oh, um… visiting a friend," Hermione said brightly.
	Hermione hesitated and then followed her instructions as the older witch headed for the door.
	Hermione laughs, walking over to Viktor.
	Hermione demanded once Ron stopped complaining about demon sisters.
	Hermione bit her tongue.
	Hermione gasped and then grinned.
	Hermione sobbed.
	Funny how her thoughts kept drifting back towards Hermione: the girl whom had become such a good friend in such short a time.
	Hermione watched them circle the boats silently, staring up at the students.
	As she collapsed against the cupboard, boneless, Hermione felt her libido flare back to life at the prospect of feeling him inside her.
	Hermione grabbed her omnioculars out of her bag and put them up to her eyes to work out who was on the team.
	Hermione looked over her shoulder at the other woman in surprise.
	Hermione thought that the moment would be forever burned in to her soul.
	But Dumbledore’s plan was not going well as far as Hermione could see.
	Hermione felt herself brighten, as she tried to calculate how exactly they might go about it, reviewing everything she’d read in the papers, trying to guess.
	Hermione let out a low groan as she correctly read the determination on his face but she nodded.
	It was satisfying to be given trust and responsibility when they hadn’t even started classes, so Tom followed the instructions carefully, and he noticed Hermione took great care in her work as well, scraping gently but thoroughly on each leaf segment.
	Hermione snapped her head to her, waiting for more.
	Hermione tilted her head, a small smirk crossing her face.
	“I don’t know…” Hermione chewed her lip and then quickly grabbed her bag, rifling through it to find the map.
	Hermione wrapped her arms around his neck and slid one knee up his leg, and Draco picked her up, holding her off the ground with her thighs locked on his hips.
	“We spoke about it at Christmas,” Hermione admitted.
	But Snape, the real Snape, simply ignored Hermione and gave a brief nod at the strange form of himself-as-Bellatrix.
	“Well, it would be different if we were dating,” Hermione said.
	Hermione shrieked, bucking under him.
	Hermione’s whole body shuddered and Patience moved her leg back and forth until the shuddering stopped and Hermione went limp, her mouth open and gasping against Patience’s shoulder.
	Bellatrix shuddered and Hermione smiled, lowering herself slowly so that her head rested between thighs that twitched when she kissed them.
	Hermione kept her eyes down as she passed, tucking the sound of fresh screaming into a heavy, earthy tome.
	Tom immediately put his arm around Hermione’s waist and kissed her cheek.
	Hermione turned for a split second to see who had spoken.
	"Hermione, there's obviously been a mass breakout which the Ministry has hushed up.
	Hermione knew that all the things she did as Bellatrix under the polyjuice potion could one day come back to haunt her just for that reason, but the thought alone of Bellatrix falling out with her lord was enough to say it was worth it.
	Hermione let that story sink in a bit.
	Beneath the heat of the afternoon sun, on a day she couldn’t name, Hermione Granger’s laughter filled the air outside the Lestrange estate.
	"Are you having more nightmares, miss Granger?"
	But as they kindle brightly all he can see is the illusion that Sirius is there to talk to him, to tell him it'll be okay, that Hermione is the brightest witch of her age, and Ron is braver than people give him credit for.
	Hermione pressed her lips together thoughtfully.
	The first hour passed at the same speed of growing grass- or History with Binns- and when one of the waiters holding a tray of wine glasses passed close by, Hermione managed to snag a glass without Narcissa noticing and drain it of its contents in three long swallows.
	"I know my life debts, Hermione," he said very seriously.
	Hermione edged closer to him.
	Too late did Hermione realize that Bellatrix was fiddling with her wand while trying to keep out of sight.
	Hermione continued her conversation with Andromeda, but the comfortable and easy atmosphere was gone.
	She’s so beautiful when she actually looks happy, Hermione thought, then frowned.
	"I wasn't ready for this," Hermione answered, watching him carefully.
	Hermione studied his face, searching for a clue as to which.
	“I’m fishing for the truth… and I always catch it, Hermione.
	They'd be prepared for you, Hermione.
	"Hermione?"
	Draco nuzzled Hermione's neck and began sliding her dress up her hips, eager to lose himself in her wet heat and forget for a while that he had no real claim on the witch before him.
	[Camera pans to Ron looking longingly at Hermione as she attempts to talk to Seamus, who is drunk and has removed his shirt.]
	Hermione looked down.
	“Hi,” Hermione said softly, her head turning towards them, though she couldn’t see.
	Hermione quickly realised what Harry had done.
	Stroud sighed and wrote something in Hermione's file before casting a pregnancy detection charm.
	Emma stood in front of him wearing what Hermione called 'robes' and what he called a figure hugging, form fitting, curve showing, dress.
	I travelled through time with Narcissa to change the past events in order to create a better world,” Hermione stated plainly, the words rolling easily off her tongue even as she worried she was on the verge of a panic attack.
	Harry told Hermione who laughed, leaning into him slightly as he slung an arm around her waist.
	Hermione quickly wiped her mouth with the edge of her jumper, and turned to run.
	Hermione's hands curled into fists, her nails digging sharply into her palms.
	Harry wheezed and tried to move but Hermione added pressure to everyone to keep them put.
	Hermione stood in front of the broken woman and leaned close to her ear and whispered to her.
	Snape could feel Hermione’s shuddering breaths against his chest.
	Harry proposed following them out to the grounds and going to visit Hagrid, but Hermione begged off the social interaction.
	Hermione sighs.
	Hermione, Harry, Ron, and Sirius all shared a look before Sirius finally spoke.
	“If I’m the one who scent-marks you, and I ask you to have sex, can you say ‘no’?” he said, looking at her with a serious expression, although Hermione couldn’t help but notice that his eyes were growing dark.
	He was, if possible, twice as relieved now that he was no longer in the running for Hermione's heart.
	It was around the same time Granger realised just who was holding her and attempted to leap away only to discover she couldn't.
	Hermione, in interview: "Am I crazy, or are Dean and Seamus not really that interested in me?"
	She chuckled, much to Hermione's amused embarrassment.
	“So,” Hermione said, a glass of wine in and giggly, “Aren’t Harry and Draco a lovely couple?” “The what,” Hermione said, absolutely delighted.
	"Hermione," she interrupted, firmly.
	"Granger!"
	“Should I even give you one?” Hermione stood before him with an arched brow.
	And…unless you’ve come up with something, Hermione, it looks like I’m still going to be one.” Hermione steps out of the way of a suit of armour, turning the corner towards the entrance stairs, frowning.
	Now, Harry, Daphne, and Hermione are off to Hogwarts, with their sights firmly set on the legendary artefact that could easily fund a dozen wars.
	“But you’re in love with Remus,” Hermione presses, desperately — desperately needing her to understand.
	Snape eyed Hermione curiously.
	She hoped Bellatrix liked it too, even if the words didn’t make sense to her, even if Hermione was just rereading an old History of Magic textbook.
	Ron rolled his eyes but allowed a smirking Neville to drag him out before Hermione noticed.
	Hermione then picked up the only new magical book she'd acquired — Complex Occlumency for the Arithmancy Mind — opened it to the first exercise, read, took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and tried to let the numbers start to dance across her mind.
	"They gave me their gift earlier this summer," Hermione says.
	Hermione flushed even brighter as Narcissa stood and looked at the clock.
	Topsy patted Hermione gently on the cheek.
	He asked looking up stairs to the bedroom window, "I mean, she's Hermione—Fleur, she's tough as nails—-she's a fighter, she wouldn't—" Bill was helping him up, Fleur was saying something about clearing a way to the couch and the ghost of Lee said perhaps he shouldn't see Hermione quite yet if this was how he was going to act, fainting, like a first year.
	Hermione lowered her voice to a loud whisper.
	Hermione picked up the kettle and made herself a drink, then settled on the sofa with her book.
	Severus then leaned over and murmured in Hermione’s ear, “ Forget flying… Out of all of Superman's powers... Hermione looks at him puzzled, “Why?” “Because then I would be able to see you naked and none else would be the wiser…” Hermione blushed as she watched his eyes skate up and down her body before he smirked.
	Cold temperatures nor rain would not stop Hermione from seeing her friend: having donned a thick winter jacket, an ushanka on her head and armed with a thermos filled to the brim with scolding hot tea, Hermione made her way through the Forbidden Forest, her breath condensing in the cold air.
	"You're not the only one who had a deal with him, Granger."
	Hermione watched as he knocked on the door, and was invited into a parlor.
	"I heard noises," Hermione mumbled nervously.
	I thought you and Hermione were close .
	Tom did not protest, which worried Hermione.
	Bellatrix withdrew, glancing around as though slightly overwhelmed and Hermione smiled reassuringly at her.
	Hermione jerked backwards, but his other hand shot out to grab her hair.
	Hermione's body was heavy.
	Next thing Hermione knew an ugly screech had bellowed its way from her chest and directed straight at the intruding bird.
	Hermione nodded.
	Hermione nodded and refocused on where Lucius was headed.
	Hermione smiled.
	When asked if Miss Granger was to be his date to the Yule Ball, Harry blushed again but confirmed he would be opening the  Ball  with her on his arm.
	Hermione smiled at the two of girls.
	"That was ruined the moment she invited you and those blood traitor Weas-" The spell rounded Hermione and hit him square in the chest, sending him down to the floor in a body bind curse.
	The tray was placed on the ground beside her, but Hermione didn’t dare move in the fear that doing so would cause the woman to curse her.
	Hermione asked, interested.
	“Hermione,” he panted, “Hermione, fucking missed this, missed how wet you get—for me, all of you, all of you for me—fucking missed you, thought I’d never—never—fuck—never get this again, never feel you—your cunt’s a fucking dream, sweetheart, never want to leave it, never want to leave you—Hermione—” “Hermione?” Hermione?” What would you like to do, Hermione?” he drawled.
	Astoria pressed the tip of her wand against the outer corner of Hermione's left eye; digging the tip back into the socket.
	Hermione’s frost has melted about two degrees, but she still looks a bit chilly around the edges.
	Hermione was in the midst of riding out her orgasm when she heard the distinct sound of a door opening followed by a woman's voice calling out, “Draco, I’m home.” Hermione froze and swallowed hard as she locked eyes with Draco.
	Suddenly, Hermione felt under-dressed in her nightdress.
	Severus glanced at Hermione.
	“I can’t.” Hermione presses her lips together tightly for a second.
	Hermione remembered reading that book… wait.
	Hermione replied, anticipation licking down her spine.
	The Second War was the one in which Hermione had fought.
	Ron and Hermione were standing just behind the Gryffindor team, anxiously watching the confrontation between the two captains.
	“Hermione!
	“…this is becoming the running gag of my life,” Hermione sighed.
	If Tom allowed some kind of connection between Hermione and Abraxas, and also with himself, would that satisfy Hermione’s need for ‘a more human connection’ as she’d put it?
	Hermione and Lee look at each other.
	“It’s fine, Granger.” She felt him rest his head on top of hers.
	Hermione stifled a laugh.
	Hermione found that to be a bit extreme.
	"Careful, she'll hear you again," Hermione muttered, smirking as she remembered the last time that Ginny had been talking about the older woman when she was nearby.
	Hermione’s heart thudded as though she’d run miles.
	Not being used to staves, Hermione awkwardly used hers as a walking staff as the procession moved on as they moved from the mansion through the forest and alongside the cliffy coast of the island, to a point that Hermione felt she was walking uncomfortably close to a thirty meter drop down into the churning waves of the sea.
	Hermione started toward him, her hand out to touch his arm, though she wisely stopped before contact, letting her arm fall by her side.
	Hermione's hands stilled.
	Sorry, Hermione, but you know what I mean.
	Hermione pulled out vials of potion to restore the spattergroit glamours and watched carefully to ensure they took effect properly.
	[Harry and Hermione exit the classroom.
	Hermione didn't even worry about Dolohov's eyes as she redressed.
	Hermione and Rodolphus shook their heads, both thinking that if they had a spare wand in his situation they would surely use it.
	It would require laws and regulations and likely an entire new department at the Ministry to manage and monitor it all— Hermione had no intention of accidentally creating a subset of second-class citizens— but considering Voldemort’s original solution had been to kill all muggleborns and their families, Hermione considered it a progressive step forward.
	Hermione grinned in response: Bellatrix' sheer enthusiasm was more than a little infectious and she walked beside her as they made their way deeper into the forest.
	Hermione was so tired from their activities during the night that she groaned when she tried to move.
	Hermione saw Pius Thicknesse and several other important figures in the Ministry.
	Hermione blinked confusedly and her horror faded as he arranged her in his lap, tousled her hair, and kissed her on the forehead, and generally failed to give the impression that he was upset with her and never wanted to shag her again.
	"Hermione," he said.
	“Ask permission to come, Miss Granger!” he demanded, and her head fell back limply.
	Her eyes abruptly flicked to one of the guards and then back to Hermione.
	Hermione asked with a smile as she pulled out some of her notes from last year's O.W.L prep, passing them over to Collin.
	Hermione laughs back.
	This was worse then the Yule Gala, Hermione thought darkly as she glared at her reflection.
	Daphne looked over Hermione’s shoulder at Tracey, taming her curls, and smirked before descending on her with the lip pencil.
	"Oh, yes," Hermione said wistfully.
	“I’ll let you go save the day, Granger.
	Hermione reached for the white dressing gown with little blue and purple flowers.
	Hermione swallows.
	“Where is Hermione?” “Why would Hermione be in the dungeon?” Felicity snapped, her concern shared by everyone else in the bond.
	Hermione dropped back into her chair terrified that if she didn’t just quietly cooperate she’d accidentally hurt Pansy’s feelings again.
	Hermione jumped as she turned to look at Pansy, her lips curled in distaste.
	"Okay," Hermione replied numbly, wondering why she was now seeming to hang on Merope's every word, as though her body urgently ached to hear the other woman speak.
	Hermione felt a mixture of relief and fury.
	"Dinner's ready," Hermione cut in, calling from the other room.
	Plumb nodded so violently, her little ears flopped into Hermione's face.
	Hermione stood straighter and jutted her chin defiantly.
	Hermione’s mum smiled.
	Hermione just stares as the heat builds.
	It's small stuff, really, that Hermione had never thought of.
	“I’m yours, Hermione,” he gasped, ecstasy overtaking the feeling of defeat.
	Hermione set her face, ignoring the light hand on her hip, just where he loved to touch her.
	asks Hermione, already moving to pour him some.
	But Hermione held up a hand, halting her.
	Ron and Hermione went on to Gryffindor tower while Harry, Draco and Blaise went to the Slytherin common room.
	He felt Hermione moving, shifting on the bench to sit on her knees beside him.
	Hermione had a swelling of gratitude in her heart towards her teacher, "Thank you Professor."
	"Horrible things happen to wizards who mess with time," Professor McGonagall swore, she took Hermione's wrist and clasped it tight.
	Hermione’s eyes widened.
	Granger?
	In a roomful of wailing he'd be able to pinpoint Granger apart from any other witch.
	Neville paused and Hermione could see the internal conflict in his expression as he glanced over toward her.
	Hermione said nothing but pushed the covers from her legs and slid out of the bed.
	She’d always been deeply suspicious of psychics, soothsayers, and prophetics, and yet perhaps spending the last few weeks working daily amid their magic in the Hall of Prophecies had caused something to rub off on her, because suddenly Hermione saw quite clearly that if she left on the back of a thestral, after this evening there would be no more Severus Snape.
	Hermione agreed, before pulling the Diary out of her satchel, along with a Muggle pen.
	“Are you all right?” Her mother whispered as she crushed Hermione to her.
	This was as many as he himself had received, and he would have to personally sign off on the document that would show Hermione Granger surpassed his own academic career at Hogwarts.
	Hermione agreed.
	Hermione blinked at her, confused.
	"I'm Sorry, Granger" by _knar.m_Half-stripped and aroused by dragonly.art.
	"Hermione, are you coming?"
	“No.” Hermione glared back, defiant.
	"Hermione, can you give me a hand please?"
	Hermione felt a dark mood settling over her; a headache descending as everyone talked.
	Hermione wrinkled up her nose.
	He remembered the night that he had returned from Voldemort and found Hermione asleep in his chambers… Voldemort had asked Bellatrix to keep something safe for him in her vault at Gringotts.
	Prior to falling into the past, Hermione would have echoed the Sorting Hat's opinion.
	Hermione led the way to a small comfortable sitting room.
	Andromeda was being particularly enigmatic as she led Hermione through the darkened halls of Catterborough Woodhouse.
	Harry’s hand found Hermione’s, and they turned to grin at each other.
	Get a hold of yourself, Hermione.
	Hermione's eyes widened slightly.
	“Oh please, I’m so close,” Hermione begged.
	Hermione swallowed.
	Hermione laughed.
	Hermione gave a muffled groan of despair just thinking of Pansy reading through it all.
	Hermione folded it and tucked it as well as the journal into her purse on his desk.
	"Cheers," Hermione's father said, pulling her close with one hand and taking her trolley with the other.
	Hermione felt a flutter.
	A thin gold chain seemed to wind about the figures, binding them together with a thread that reminded Hermione of a spell.
	Hermione stepped as close as she could and discovered a room no larger than a closet, rich with the scent of centuries-old books.
	Ron was nowhere near Hermione.
	Hermione's face burned in embarrassment.
	Bill Weasley is saying something with nostalgia in his voice, and Ron and Hermione are both giving Harry side-glances of knowing.
	Of Hermione.
	“Give me the Horcrux back,” Hermione said, holding out her hand uncertainly as she would to a strange dog.
	Ginny sat down knowing Hermione needed to do this.
	Hermione watched the  Oculus  from a safe distance.
	Hermione nodded.
	Even in his most secret fantasies he always imagined Granger responding to any move on his part with violence.
	Laughing, Hermione dove behind another bush and found Andy.
	Hermione had already managed to transfigure her rabbit perfectly, of course, and Ron and Neville were in the process of attempting to transfigure theirs, but Harry's was still a rabbit, though it was dark grey.
	But I won’t wait forever.” The siren darted closer and nibbled at Hermione’s bottom lip.
	Hermione knew he blamed himself for Dumbledore's death, regardless of how often she and Ron insisted otherwise.
	Hermione felt like it was probably a mistake.
	Draco still barely acknowledged the pregnancy beyond how it related to Hermione’s health.
	Hermione put together the pieces of the puzzle she’d been given and winced at the picture presented.
	“I don’t feel this punishment is warranted, Miss Granger, but I can hear in your voice how much you feel you need this.” His tone was liquid honey, smooth and sweet.
	Though Cygnus seemed far more calm that Andromeda, Hermione could tell that he was worried.
	He’d quickly turned heel and floo’d back to Hogwarts from the Ministry Atrium after his dreadful discovery of Hermione’s intended destination, and spent the day grouchily supervising the elves as they unpacked his and Hermione’s belongings.
	“Your entire family is ridiculous,” Hermione groaned.
	There was a beat of silence and Hermione looked around to see several of her husbands looking between her face and where she'd managed to tear open the delicate buttons on her robes from her bosom down.
	It was also clear to Hermione that while the official story was that Bill and Caro were providing extra security for the tournament, they were in fact searching for something in Hogwarts – something that they'd thought they might find in the Chamber of Secrets or Godric's Hollow but hadn't.
	“Granger,” Draco says.
	"I don't know," Hermione whispered, her fists tightening.
	“Was it necessary to have it brought it here by wizards, at full size?” Hermione asked.
	Sirius's attention quickly fell on Hermione's form, silently willing her forward to stab the bloody thing before it got a little too chatty.
	Hermione was in awe about the entire thing, even though there was a crucial part missing from it.
	Hermione still stood beside him, petting his neck.
	Hermione walks along after him next to Remus, casting a lumos.
	Their hips ground together and Hermione could finally feel Draco’s erection rubbing against her clit.
	"Yes, we are," not-Hermione said smoothly, sauntering into the room with Malfoy at her heels.
	Hermione's lost Alicia—her… her Alicia, because she really doesn't know how else to call her.
	Flying— Hermione chuckles.
	"Hermione insisted we do."
	Harry, when Hermione could finally make herself lift her head to face him, looked pale and sick and like he'd been crying himself.
	Perhaps that would play to Hermione’s advantage.
	Ginny sobered up, smiling gently at Hermione and shaking her head.
	Hermione came across the table to strike the woman.
	Hermione’s eyes grew impossibly wide.
	Hermione has never, never felt so helpless.
	Even though the plan was to blow up the entire fortress prison, now Hermione wanted to take things, Grindelwald’s prized things, and use them against him in any and every way she could.
	Hermione asked, before Luna could make Draco feel even more uncomfortable.
	Hermione paused.
	[Black screen; Hermione voiceover.]
	Hermione: [nods] "Yes."
	"Pretty sure they don't know about the Honeydukes entrance," Harry offered, looking at Hermione, "we can sneak in and hide in the hump till the Marauders Map shows the coast is clear."
	"They really will," Hermione agreed, relaxing into to Fred's gentle hold.
	Ginny gave a dramatic sigh, pulled a book out, and left Hermione alone until Hermione had to leave for History of Magic.
	Sirius and Remus stood awkwardly in the hallway, both clearly struggling with the need to comfort her, but neither in a position to do so due to the fact that Hermione was not Mia yet.
	On the table were the cans, one can of spam opened and partially consumed by Hermione while she was in the shower.
	Hermione wondered about the man's loyalty.
	Hermione craned her neck as she tried to read them, but her limbs felt like lead.
	By the next lines, Hermione found herself bracing her body against the nearest tree.
	Hermione suggested, sitting up in her chair, watching the two.
	They both startled when a cough came from just outside the booth, and Draco hid a smile in Hermione's hair as the server tapped her pencil on her order pad.
	“Okay,” Hermione said, finally.
	Before he even consciously made up his mind about all the questions and thoughts he had, he was brushing riotous curls out of Hermione's face and leaving a trail of hot, wet kisses down her jaw and neck.
	He’d sit next to Granger in the library while she grew more and more uncomfortable, and he could smell her unwilling arousal.
	Hermione rode Mystery,  happy to have something normal to do.
	“It is, and he’ll certainly need it all, too,” Hermione smiled into her glass as she nursed her drink—a dark red wine with notes of an oak spice that was being served to all the guests.
	Hermione shook her head.
	Finally, Snape took a step back and separated himself from Hermione.
	Hermione stormed over to the door.
	Hermione looked up.
	It would seem your lord has trained you well, Miss Granger.
	Hermione lifted the ball closer to inspect it, “No, it’s just a crystal ball, why?” If the prophecy was about Hermione, in time she would be able to view it when she became of age or something triggered it.
	"She's a sneaky little spy, aren't you, Granger?"
	Hermione had blushed at the compliment and graciously accepted the little food he was able to bring her.
	I don’t care about my workload.” Hermione stiffly turned to leave.
	She was looking at Hermione with a predatory smirk, goading her, stepping carefully, gracefully around the space between the trees, while Hermione tried to mirror her.
	For as she sat there pondering her own thoughts, Hermione Granger was waiting for a storm to come.
	He glanced at Hermione, who reluctantly raised her violin.
	Hermione stiffened.
	Hermione pressed the final required button on the VCR's remote control and watched in satisfaction as a small flash of light filled the room and the door to the next room slowly ground open.
	Hermione shook her head.
	“So true, Hermione,” Professor Merrythought seemed to share their frustration, and he thought once again that muggleborns, or half-bloods stood the best chance of making exciting magical discoveries, simply because they didn’t take magical knowledge for granted.
	Hermione is grateful that he doesn't look at her as he says that.
	Hermione, come here.” Hermione did.
	Seeing Hermione descend into the common room had been like the most wonderful dream he'd ever had.
	Hermione blushed and reached back to slap his arse.
	Hermione's gaze followed him, smirking slightly at the way his hair stuck up straight in the back.
	Luna and Hermione were ushered inside and took seats at the dining table with Sirius's invitation, Hermione sliding into the empty seat beside Harry, Luna taking the one next to Ron.
	And with as much dignity and grace as she could muster, Hermione walked away from them, heading towards the glass door, leaving the drawing room and going outside.
	Hermione, on the other hand was shuddering.
	Hermione smiles.
	But Hermione was not fully rational in the moment.
	Tom was about to voice his approval for that sentiment, and perhaps tease Hermione about her earlier claim that killing the Malfoys wasn’t a good idea, when Abraxas’s owl tapped at his window.
	If only Granger would have actually looked at her.
	Though Hermione had been hypersensitive to her surroundings, Bellatrix had managed to spot an approaching monster long before she had.
	“Attacked?” Hermione chewed her lip and tried to remember but there was a fuzzy hole where that memory should be.
	“Now we wait.” Hermione sat on the window seat and pulled her knees up under her chin.
	"It is true that your husband's reputation precedes him," another man agreed, giving Hermione a short nod.
	recruited?” Hermione tried to be discreet but finding the appropriate words was difficult.
	Please, just look at me, Hermione thought.
	"Hermione, huh?"
	"I've seen your aerial acrobatics," Hermione chuckled, letting Zipper fly off to land on top of Bellatrix' head.
	And suddenly, Hermione felt the sickness in her stomach once more.
	The usual sensation of magical transportation overcame Hermione and she was soon deposited on a whole new floating island.
	"Theo," Hermione blurted, and Draco blinked, stepping back.
	Hermione heard the fireplace go off in the living room and she quickly ended her spell, tucking her wand back into her extendable pocket.
	Hermione cried out, pushing inadvertently into Harry’s hand.
	When Hermione got a good look at her expression, her heart broke.
	"Hermione!"
	“I don’t know, Hermione, I’m feeling pretty lucky tonight,” he replied, his gaze lingering on her face before he turned back to the stage.
	Ginny had instinctively known what Hermione was about to do and what to expect, and had been ready to follow up on it.
	“Did you put my school bag in my room?” Hermione asked as she sat down.
	Hermione whirled around; her wand drawn as he stepped close to her.
	It she was starting to talk to Ron more and more—he was trying to make an effort to try and talk to Hermione.
	For the first time ever, Hermione felt free to express the many facets of her love outside the manor, which once experienced, was rather revolutionary.
	Crookshanks glared at him, broke away from Hermione and rubbed against Bellatrix's side.
	Hermione was still reeling in shock so it took her a moment to answer.
	Hermione blinked, caught off guard by the ecstasy of his voice amidst such euphoria.
	Hermione replied with a smirk.
	After everyone around her and the twins are back in their own conversations, Fred tries moving Hermione's plate towards her.
	Hermione didn't remember her from the Ministry.
	In the time it took Bellatrix to deflect the spell, Hermione had made her way behind another tree, the previous one crashing to the ground with an ominous boom.
	Hermione, who had three books open, one for reading, one for runic translations, and one for reference, handed him one of the jam-filled biscuits he liked best without comment, though they both paused and shared a glance as their fingers met and magic flowed between them.
	"He took Hermione to the Yule Ball the first time," Harry explained.
	whispered Hermione.
	“You have a debilitating infatuation with him.”  “Ginny!” Hermione had closed her book and turned to face the ginger.
	But on the other hand, getting Hermione any kind of healer training would be very desirable.
	Hermione sat down across from Pansy, the mug on the table between her hands.
	Hermione grinned wickedly as she thought of her next question.
	Hermione smiles back.
	“You’re disgusting!” Hermione croaked out, her windpipe still recovering from its former constriction.
	"Nobody will be looking in Neville's direction, Harry, as long as he doesn't give them any reason to," Hermione said firmly, "and we need to make sure Weasley doesn't give them a reason to either by regaining consciousness."
	What if Luna found Hermione?
	Hermione was quiet for a long moment.
	she sighed, "It's where they find a word-or a phrase, and they tag it as a Taboo," Hermione said, now wiping the memories of the blonde Death Eater.
	“This is so impractical,” Hermione grumbled, looking down at her mug.
	Harry felt Hermione's hand tighten on his.
	Hermione and Ron were talking up ahead.
	Hermione sighed as she sank lower into the hot water of her bath.
	Hermione turns back to Ron, brushes her trembling hands over his face.
	And now that Hermione had let herself really fall for him, she was preparing to go on the run.
	"I know a jinx when I see one," Hermione was insisting.
	Hermione pulled back and smiled slightly even though it ached to see how much Harry resembled James.
	Hermione arched her back, her scream muffled by Bellatrix' mouth until she collapsed back onto the bed, spent and panting.
	You caught Hermione!"
	It was astounding how quickly things could move in the magical world when you had a nearly unending number of galleons, and Hermione definitely had that now.
	Harry hurries over to Hermione.
	He left and Hermione sat down.
	"But they want you to be someone named Harry," Hermione insisted.
	Hermione stood up.
	When the hallway was empty, Hermione let herself look over at Draco.
	"Are you familiar with children's stories, Miss Granger?"
	So yes, there had been that little incident and the several hours of upset that had followed it, plus after the first day Harry had yet to join them again in bed, seeming to prefer watching which Hermione didn't mind but was frustrating Tom, but it had been a dream-like holidays so far and it was the day after Harry's swimming lesson that the somewhat overdue conversation regarding their sex life ended up taking place.
	“You’re not stupid, Hermione.
	She moves closer and reaches under the top of the bodice, pushing the chemise down so it’s not sticking out.Now Hermione can’t help but shiver as cold fingers brush over her chest.
	“Yes, you are right,” Hermione finally said.
	“Oh, Ron,” Hermione says.
	"Hi baby," Hermione cooed at her daughter, giving her a radiant smile as her grandmother scooped her up into her arms.
	Realizing she was openly staring, Hermione turned back to the table to find Draco’s focus still solely on the mystery witch.
	Hermione shook her head and smiled at him.
	Hermione shook her head and busied herself with her plate again.
	In seconds, she was moving them across the sky, and Hermione understood for the first time the delight Harry would express about soaring on his broom.
	"Good luck, Harry," said Hermione and Daphne in unison.
	The only thing that got him through the stack of paperwork—toxicology reports, scent analysis reports, spell damage reports, and more—was counting down the time until he could meet Hermione for their double date with Harry and Pansy.
	Hermione was frozen midstep, unbearably close to him.
	He hissed in alarm and Hermione's hand disappeared into a slit in the side of her dress hidden by the layers of the skirts and reemerged holding a familiar ring, identical to the one she'd just taken off him.
	Hermione considered.
	In the privacy of her trunk, Hermione ripped the paper off the last of the books she'd received from her parents and placed it next to the others in a line so that the edges matched up just so.
	He could not live with himself if he watched Hermione fall away.
	Hermione had been very aware of the political status they held in regards to having Voldemort’s favour, mostly as insurance of their safety, but she hadn’t given a lot of thought before now to the potential influence they had just as themselves.
	In a further attempt to soothe her, Hermione started to comb her fingers through the younger girl's hair, frowning lightly as her fingers kept getting caught on snarls of hair.
	“You’re worried about that monster when she just tried to kill our dad?” Ron snarled, rounding on Hermione who flinched.
	Hermione tugs him back into his seat with a tut.
	Frozen in place, Hermione’s ears started burning.
	"It's too late for them," Hermione called as she made her way, her voice strong.
	"Not today," Hermione smirked, kissing him softly.
	Hermione stared at him.
	Hermione gave a little shriek as she reflexively jerked away from the pain.
	Hermione was still frozen, her heart still racing.
	I think she's planning to turn your room into a closet, Granger."
	"Hermione, you talk too much," she dropped her hand and shook her head.
	There were certainly a number of very strange things about Granger.
	"No, it can't be Harry– he's with the Order; what happened to Hermione?"
	Hermione flushed, embarrassed at how enthusiastic Ginny was.
	And now that diary was in Hermione's care.
	Hermione watched as Draco’s nostrils flared but he did nothing else.
	Hermione wasn’t entirely clear on how.
	Hermione’s hands were bound to conjured pegs on the sides of the doorway, and the rope wound down across her arms, wrapping in circles around her breasts.
	No touching Hermione."
	The problem was while he realised he might like Hermione enough for him to consider her as a potential girlfriend, he really had no idea how she felt about him.
	"Really, because when you were claiming that you weren't psychic earlier-" Hermione began.
	When the lift doors opened, and Draco was not there with coffee, Hermione realized how many people read Skeeter’s society section.
	Hermione stood and swiftly conjured a full-length mirror.
	"I know that look," Hermione smiled.
	"But—" Hermione stammered.
	Theo: "Well, Granger, you clearly need to read your memos more carefully."
	"Let's go," Hermione urged.
	She folds his fingers over the wood and returns to the couch, and when Harry is sure she is asleep he twirls the wand in his fingers, gazing at it in wonder — because Hermione is right, somehow, it's almost… intimate — holding another's wand and feeling the faint, vibrating tingles of magic which travel through Harry's skin upon contact.
	"Don't know what got into me," he said, shrugging with deliberate casualness to push back the slight hint of disappointment as Hermione looked away from him.
	Hermione: [sighing] "No, Professor, it isn't."
	Leagore takes a steadying breath and nods, Hermione whispers a reparo at the stone.
	Tom's face darkened in response, a sign of just how on edge the older boy was, and Hermione couldn't help the faint trickle of alarm she felt as she watched him seize onto Harry's arm, yanking the younger boy towards him.
	Hermione’s sitting up in bed.
	“Malfoy didn’t.” Hermione chuckled.
	Hermione took notice of this.
	Hermione fought a blush, her heart pounding.
	Hermione quickly leaned forward and grabbed Lucius’s sleeve, lightly.
	Hermione hoped that it wasn’t just there for show.
	“We can do it at my house,” Hermione offered up the country manor-home without really thinking about it.
	Narcissa capped the vial, and Hermione saw her fingers shake only once.
	"The point, Miss Granger," Shacklebolt cut in, "is that this is your…" He glanced down, skimming the page.
	"We're connected, Hermione and I," Lord Voldemort tells them gleefully.
	Hermione tilted her head, "Why do you automatically side with me?"
	Hermione had raised a hesitant hand.
	Hermione was startled from her reverie by her Master’s firm tone.
	“Miss Granger!” Rita had spotted her.
	That's what Hermione always said.
	Minutes longer, and you would be a corpse, Miss Granger.
	Hermione wakes up early on Saturday.
	"I was wondering if you wanted to join me," he said, and Hermione rolled around so she was facing him, surprised.
	Hermione jolts to sit up straight, mouth falling open in amazement as she stares at Bellatrix.
	To Hermione’s arm.
	Her eyes darted around wildly in their sockets and Hermione knew that the other woman was having another internal battle with herself.
	Hermione leapt up at the familiar outline against the curtains and sprinted across the room, almost tripping over herself in her haste.
	"Ah, Captain Granger," he said quietly to himself, half-smiling.
	Hermione gave her a small, understanding smile and stepped closer, reaching out her arms.
	Hermione.
	In one last twist, Hermione was able to drag her down to her level.
	"Hermione, you're here… What are you doing here?"
	Fleur was the bolder one, and stepped over to Hermione.
	“It’s a constrictor, not poisonous,” Hermione said, thinking logic was the best tactic for a Ravenclaw crowd.
	In the dark, Hermione tossed the sheet off her body, and listened quietly as Snape removed his pants.
	My lovely introduction to the future over there”—Sirius jerked his chin towards Hermione with a grin—“made sure to drill that bit of information into my brain.
	Hermione had told him she didn't know how quickly the toxin would act and that once he'd administered it he should get out– fast.
	Hermione felt her cheek sag even more against the frozen marble.
	Hermione couldn’t help but notice her only son avoiding her.
	Hermione muttered, looking furious for a moment.
	When her friend gestured to Hermione, Millie sighed and closed her book.
	I’m beginning to question how either of you managed to survive the war.” He dragged a hand through his hair and stared pointedly at Hermione.
	“Oh…” Hermione said in confusion glancing at the wards.
	Hermione opened her eyes and stood rather gracefully for someone who was lying on the couch being coddled by five grown wizards.
	Hermione laughs.
	"One need not be saddled with unfortunate feelings in our world, Hermione."
	Hermione beckoned to the Ravenclaw, now with a downed troll between her and them, and still very much in grab range.
	Hermione sighed and stood.
	I can’t do anything, Hermione.
	Hermione arched an eyebrow, squeezing his rapidly hardening length in her hand, rubbing the pad of her thumb against the tip, and Harry hastily shook his head.
	As Hermione knelt by the north corner, she focused on the delicate task at hand.
	Directly across from Hermione sat Draco, and beside him sat Jonathan, who was next to his Dominatrix of the past few months, Clarise.
	"Granger, can you please stop babbling for a moment and just confirm if I heard correctly.
	“I don’t loathe it,” Hermione retorted.
	Lucius could very well lock Hermione in her bedroom suite and throw away the key.
	There was silence, and Narcissa squeezed Hermione’s hand.
	Looks Hermione up and down.
	Hermione stood and, after giving Draco a parting peck on the head, stepped over the wall of melted candles and made her way across the garden.
	When she had first held her new wand, Hermione had felt better, like a real witch again, but that evening, when she and Narcissa had discussed the need for her to restrain and disguise the limits of her magical abilities, her frustration had returned.
	"The chamber of secrets has been opened," Hermione read out, looking nauseated.
	A ragged gasp escaped Hermione as she pointed her wand at the centaur.
	Previously: Hermione hadn 't been there for the past six years; she didn't know how utterly devoted Charity remained to Gideon.
	Hermione had seen Bellatrix as a woman once before when she had attacked Walburga’s portrait - but she had been wild then: dirty, torn clothes, tangled hair, feral eyes.
	Hermione was abruptly reminded that she worked in a bookstore.
	Almost everything about the stories had made Hermione snort derisively over the sheer implausibility as she snuck Parvati’s books back onto their shelf.
	She was Hermione Granger, she didn't shed tears-at least, not in good company.
	Hermione relaxes back against Bella.
	Hermione gasps.
	“Enough!” Hermione seethed, hoping to derail this bickering before it could turn into a full-blown duel.
	Harry and Ron shared a confused look that caused Hermione to roll her eyes.
	Hermione shuddered beneath him.
	Hermione kissed him hard, and Harry gasped in surprise as she led the way, sucking on his lower lip and licking into his mouth as she leaned over him.
	“She attacked Hermione?
	But you're not just claiming to be Hermione Granger, are you?"
	And despite the terseness in her words, This-timeline Hermione could easily hear both the promise and the hope in her other self's words.
	Hermione would not have her blood on any of their hands.
	Hermione scowled.
	Hermione smirked.
	Hermione stroked her thumb over the other woman’s cheekbone and then Bellatrix withdrew, settling herself back into position at the other end of the sofa.
	The hag had never spoken or smiled, eerily reminding Hermione of Bathilda Bagshot – or more accurately, the corpse of Bathilda Bagshot.
	“I was thinking about my parents here,” Hermione admits.
	Lucius whispered a spell and Hermione felt cool lubricant leak out of her tight virgin passage.
	"People wouldn't be able to share news except face to face—"Hermione said, her eyes heavy—as though she knew all to well the dilemma he was trying to prevent.
	"Sorry," he said over his shoulder, distractedly addressing Hermione again after a brief communication across the studio.
	Hermione shakes herself.
	Hermione almost laughed again.
	“That’s it, Miss Granger.
	So that you guys will have happy lives.” He spoke haltingly, as if each word exacted a toll on him “I think about Ron and Hermione getting together and having kids.
	Hermione sighed, shaking her head.
	Hermione shuddered at the depravity displayed.
	So, Hermione thought somewhat despairingly, her first attempt at match-making was a dismal failure.
	"Sure," not-Draco said impassively, not looking at them as not-Granger dragged Draco away.
	Hermione made her way to the bathroom and splashed water on her face.
	Hermione— Tox— felt the strange cracked-egg sensation sliding along her scales and made an unhappy noise but slid down from the seat, safely hidden from view as she darted down the steps, easily avoiding the patrolling professors keeping everyone in their seats as she made her way down to the grounds, rapidly weaving her way across the grass to the healer’s tent.
	Hermione could faintly smell his cologne — it reminded her of pomegranates and the smell of the ocean.
	“But you haven’t.” Was Hermione’s snappy reply.
	Hermione stared at him blankly.
	On the second day of spending the day in their company Draco reached his limit of being corrected on her name, “Can’t I just call you Hermione?
	“He hasn’t done anything to me.” It was all the reassurance Hermione could give.
	Hermione snorted at that.
	It spun in a show-off-y manner, clearly trying to get Riddle’s attention away from Hermione and onto itself.
	"What you did was unbelievably dangerous, Hermione," Harry said.
	“Then we don’t do that,” said Hermione.
	Harry started discussing plans for the holidays, what they should do etc and Hermione half listened.
	"I guess technology and magic don't have to be so divorced from each other as we previously thought," replied Hermione.
	Hermione corrected her sharply.
	But not from Hermione.
	Hermione.
	Hermione stood, spinning in a circle as she took in her surroundings, expecting a dragon to emerge from the shadows.
	On a silent cue that Hermione did not understand, the four men moved.
	They climbed until Hermione was sure that she could go no further, and she asked if they could stop and rest.
	Ginny's knuckles are white, so Hermione assumes that she's having a similar feeling as Fred.
	She glares at Hermione.
	In the relative calm that followed, Lockhart straightened up and caught sight of the handful of Slytherins, including Harry and Hermione, who were almost at the door and said, "Well, I'll ask you there to just nip the rest of them back into their cage."
	Luna’s, Ginny’s, and Hermione’s contributions did little to help Harry.
	“Granger.”  “Don’t fall in, Granger,” Malfoy huffs, sarcasm momentarily tearing away her focus.
	"Come on, Hermione, come and have some food," Harry says, and it sounds desperate.
	“Uh…I wasn’t calling you, Tiggy, I just said your name to Hermione because—” Hermione strokes her hand over Bellatrix’s arm.
	Instantly, Hermione felt disgusted with herself: she'd been looking forward to talking with Trix all day and the first thing she did was to lie to her.
	"I was just saying," Hermione replied.
	"Then I think we won't have a copy of that pendant made," he said, rubbing Hermione's shoulder.
	That would be a wonderful spot to read, Hermione thought.
	Hermione’s hand slid slowly to her pocket, and she gripped her wand tightly as she stared at the window.
	"But Harry," Hermione looked puzzled.
	Hermione reaches around blindly on the bedside table for her wand.
	Hermione smiled, moving to embrace Bellatrix.
	Hermione screamed as the floor beneath her feet exploded, knocking her to the ground and giving Bellatrix the chance to move in.
	"I'm sure you've heard this before, but you have a beautiful body, Hermione."
	Hermione looked at him and found herself momentarily frozen by his bottomless black gaze.
	"You made Severus so happy, Hermione.
	"You…you're…" Hermione stumbled over her words, shocked.
	Hermione had a plan half-concocted in her mind, and now that she had decided that her body was not in any immediate danger of falling apart, she would begin to put it into action.
	"Out," he commanded flatly to the other occupants, and they slowly made their way out the back entrance, leaving Hermione alone with what looked to be at least four other Death Eaters.
	But Hermione Granger had colour; bright and fierce and real, a bloodied streak of red against the grey that bled colour into his life.
	This will be my room, Hermione thought, amazed.
	Bellatrix paused, glanced from Hermione to Andromeda disappearing up the steps and sadly turned around and followed Andy back to their room.
	At Hermione and Bellatrix, coming down the stairs.
	It took longer than it usually did, but Hermione soon calmed her racing thoughts enough so that she was no longer on the brink of a panic attack.
	Well Hermione does know the words.
	Hermione had hated how Sirius had treated Kreacher, but even Hermione had to allow that Sirius had been badly treated by the elf as a child on his own mother’s orders.
	The excitement was palpable, Hermione thought, as the small group instantly formed a line and disappeared down the tunnel, the taller ones ducking as they went.
	Hermione next to her.
	Want to come with me, Hermione?” Hermione doesn’t look less shocked, but she bravely raises her chin and says, “Yes, OK. What is it though?” Ron, who has his mouth full, scowls, and then his forehead creases, as he clearly considers whether or not he should be jealous that another man has asked Hermione out for the evening.
	"Please don't," Wallace said immediately, "I dare say Hermione's reticence is in part our fault as we may have indicated to her that we weren't happy with the amount of danger this school of hers seems to place her in every year.
	"As much as I am disappointed that we came to this point because of misunderstandings and the truth finally being known by all," his eyes flicker to his son who ducks his head, "I am glad we can come together given the arrival of Harry and Hermione, but we should conclude this discussion before we move on.
	Hermione retorted.
	Hermione stared in astonishment and sidled nervously behind the Headmistress.
	Hermione nodded slowly, wiping away the tears that had fallen.
	Hermione had a feeling that the only thing that would was right in front of her- once again becoming hard as Harry stroked himself slowly.
	Bellatrix pulls back slightly, looks into Hermione’s eyes.
	Wentworth, Miss Granger.
	"Yeah, wow, it's so surreal to meet you," offered Hermione along with her hand, looking moderately recovered from her initial stumbling.
	What an amazing prediction," Hermione scoffed.
	Hermione watched the countryside pass from the window, noticing how there seemed to be much more snow this year than last.
	"I wrote to my parents yesterday about what the Weasleys did to you," Daphne immediately started to explain, lowering her voice as she and Tracey pulled Hermione over to one of the corners of the common room for privacy.
	Again, Ron and Hermione gave Pansy matching looks of displeasure, but Harry tapped his foot four times, and Hermione grudgingly raised her violin to her shoulder.
	"Hermione?"
	"Hermione.
	Well, not exactly normal, that would be an insult: Hermione was intelligent, witty, knowledgeable and polite.
	Hermione spoke first as she accepted her cup.
	Draco felt pride that Hermione had at least damaged him before they arrived.
	"What this means, then, is that your difficulties are being caused by external factors," she said, looking between Hermione and Arthur.
	Ever since they’d declared their feelings for one another, Hermione had been struck by the astonishing difference in him.
	Hermione looked up at him, and watched as he summarized the report, pointed to the important charts and maps, maintained control of the room, and for the first time she wondered what it was he planned to do after his probation completed in December.
	"Mr. Potter, Miss Granger– what were you two doing out of bed and outside the castle at this late hour?"
	"I apologize for all this fuss, Hermione, dear," she said, still not looking at her.
	Hermione shakes her head firmly.
	A/N: Okay, so the next chapter can either be a fly on the wall chapter with Hermione and Lucius.
	"Eyes forward, Granger.
	After alerting Hope of the arrival of her godsons, Hermione used a handful of Floo powder to make her way to the hospital.
	How he could affect being a gentleman after the horror he had just put her through was beyond Hermione’s ken.
	Hermione was different; he loved her so he would do anything she needed to make her feel better… er, at least more comfortable, but he had no desire to care for sick people he didn't like.
	Hermione turned to see him, still wide-eyed, staring at her.
	Hermione went to put her arm around Pansy's shoulder, but Pansy drew back, shaking her head.
	Hermione smiled.
	Blaise crossed his arms and looked Hermione up and down as though he were reevaluating her.
	"Just tell me one thing," she said, lowering her voice for Hermione alone.
	"And I only ever give one.” Hermione gave him her best wolf smile, hungry and predatory, and tapped the flat of the now bloodstained steel against his bulbous nose.
	“Hermione?
	Hermione scoffs in disbelief.
	Hermione had glanced just long enough to see a tall, pale man with dark hair greeting the librarian, an older woman who sounded so positively thrilled to see Mr. Riddle that there was no doubt at all about who that was, just a stone's throw away from her, leaning over the counter.
	Blush spreading down her throat, Hermione stammered into silence.
	You can't be serious," Hermione said roughly, pausing to scoff.
	Harry and Hermione had spoken to the Dark Lord.
	Hermione actually felt rather depraved and divine with her arms out and slightly above her, her legs spread in a V leaving her exposed and completely vulnerable.
	Hermione’s shoulders are shaking now, holding back laughter.
	For some reason, the glare cast toward Sirius had Hermione on edge, and she listened closely as Sirius whispered to Harry, "Molly doesn't approve of Mundungus."
	"Honestly, Harry, I'd suspect you two were having an affair if you weren't bound to Hermione," Padma said.
	"Hullo, Hermione," he said, standing up from his sofa and folding away the book in his lap.
	“You guys really need to tell me what the hell happened back there.” Hermione told them, once they got back to a deserted common room.
	"Well, I've made work of your suggestion of writing a book about my experience with Hermione.
	"You must be Miss Granger," Madam Weasley said.
	It was just Sirius and Hermione.
	"I'm sorry," he said quietly, gesturing to an ominous cloud of smoke that hung over the rooftops of Hogsmeade ahead, and Malfoy froze for a moment, blinking, before suddenly taking off at a run, Hermione following after him.
	"You do us proud in there, Hermione.
	Hermione smiles.
	“Let go of me!” Ginny tried to pull Hermione’s hands off.
	Hermione gaped at him.
	Hermione suggested and he snorted.
	When Hermione saw it, she tilted her head back gave a choking laugh.
	“Oh, yes.” Hermione said, sitting on the edge of the sofa.
	And why isn’t Hermione licking me like that when we get out of the tub?
	Miss Granger — Miss Greengrass — two points each to Slytherin."
	Hermione plunged her hands beneath the water and felt around.
	Hermione spat, springing after them.
	Hermione finds herself smiling back softly.
	“She hasn’t told me,” Hermione said.
	“As you know the Black’s have a tradition when naming their children,” Bella smiled as she grabbed Hermione’s hand to rest it on the bump.
	Sirius turned to face Hermione and tilted his head back, opening his mouth.
	Hermione urged, while Ginny egged him on by telling him- C’mon, paint that little slut white!
	Hermione can see her friend's hands trembling at her sides.
	Hermione, Mock bows to Hermione and offers her some clothes.
	“Go, Miss Granger.
	Hermione curled into Severus with a groggy sigh, her arm delicately draped over his scarred body like a sash of pride.
	The irony was that the last time he could remember someone genuinely trying to please him was her—Hermione—in his classroom, before all this started.
	Astoria told Hermione.
	Perhaps Narcissa would appreciate that, despite the fact that Hermione may be asking about her own husband.
	Hermione asked and he swallowed hard then nodded.
	Hermione: [furiously] "Then will you stop yelling, Malfoy?"
	Hermione donned her spare scrubs and tied her hair back.
	Hermione's jaw drops.
	[Clips of Harry and Ron occasionally bumping shoulders as they pass, glaring at each other as Hermione casually chats with other people.]
	Hermione frowned.
	Mia, of course, had known, and Remus figured that one day Hermione would discover it for herself, but he assumed that it would be a long way off.
	Hermione made a contemplative sound.
	"That's true," Hermione confirmed, looking around.
	Maybe she wasn't going to end up Mrs Ronald Weasley but Hermione thought she was a good first girlfriend for Ron – one who genuinely seemed to care for him.
	“And Ginny lent me her broom—“ Hermione grabbed her beaded bag out of her coat pocket, reached in and pulled out Ginny’s Firebolt.
	Hermione squeezed both of their hands.
	“You’d be correct!” She almost glided over to Hermione from the amount of excitement she was experiencing.
	Hermione: [sighs] "I just think that at this point we should really start catching on to things that have already happened to us.
	But then…Hannah had been trying to keep Sue's confidence and Hermione couldn't say with certainty that she wouldn't have done the same thing in Hannah's place.
	But Granger—  The most disconcerting part of the entire affair, however, is that Granger remains…ignorant of her own vulnerability.
	Hermione’s heart breaks in her chest as she stumbles away from Autonoe.
	Hermione stared at the ground in silence.
	Hermione’s hips rose toward his finger, but he stubbornly refused to provide her with any friction.
	"Hermione," he said, and she lifted her bush of hair to look at him.
	Hermione didn't believe I could pass a muggle driving test because she has literally no faith in my abilities."
	Hermione groans.
	Hermione turned and fired another hex—for some reason, a body-bind curse was what she cast; it had flown from her wand before she had time to think—and as Riddle dispersed the simple spell she disapparated again, hoping to show up at his backside before he could recover.
	Hermione caught a glimpse of something large, something scaly, something monstrous, and though she knew she was not in danger here, she clamped her eyes shut.
	Hermione took a deep breath through her lungs.
	Hermione: "What's that, now?"
	Hermione raised her eyebrows and stared at Pansy.
	Hermione threw the covers aside and swung her feet off the bed.
	Hermione fanned herself.
	Hermione breathed a sigh of relief as Ginny's face fell with her disappointment.
	Alicia waves at the boys' dormitory steps from across the room and Hermione takes that as her cue.
	Lips press quickly to Hermione’s neck.
	The sudden interruption of her thoughts seemed to startle Bellatrix a little and her dark eyes whipped around to pin Hermione in place.
	Hermione had spent the better part of the evening speaking to various Ministers and other foreign dignitaries, flanked by her two husbands who had commanded each conversation with ease.
	"I'm sorry that I didn't tell you before term ended," Hermione explained, nervously gripping the side of her chair, trying to dig in with her nails into the wood.
	"Yes," Hermione said nodding, but looking at the vials and then Dumbledore, "Professor, are those memories—are they of our meetings?"
	But Bellatrix only had eyes for Hermione.
	Hermione retorted.
	"I'm sorry, Trix," said Hermione.
	Hermione took it.
	Hermione retorted.
	My name’s Hermione.
	To Hermione's utter horror, she was now holding the match' golden snitch.
	Hermione asked playfully with a roll of her eyes.
	She tells him everything she's already told Arcturus but she lets slip more details – the name of the witch being Hermione, the fact that Harry Potter has a lightning bolt scar on his forehead, and that Avalon still sleeps.
	Hermione grimaces.
	Hermione's brow furrowed.
	There was a huffing sound from Hermione, but she didn’t respond.
	Madam Pince had been complaining unceasingly of Hermione Granger for the last six years.
	After the war, in the summer that stretched on far too long, Hermione had spent the few weeks proceeding school helping Ron get George and the shop back on their feet.
	“Good,” McGonagall said, although there was a slight knowing look in her eyes that caught Hermione’s attention.
	When Hermione said nothing, her mother gasped.
	Draco excused himself, and Skeeter started her onslaught of questions on Hermione.
	She hesitated before offering it to Hermione.
	“You were right… Hermione, you’re right.
	That was surprisingly perceptive of Ron, Hermione mused, before remonstrating inwardly that she was being unfair to the red-head.
	Hermione made her way cautiously back to her room.
	Isn't that right, Hermione?"
	"It seems my instinct was right," said Hermione after taking a careful look at the photo showing the exact moment when the cloaked man bumped into Bellatrix.
	Hermione shook her head violently, trying to pull his hand away.
	Hermione had drawn upon her own previous spellwork for Dumbledore’s Army and created a binding secret keeping agreement, to make sure that neither the existence of the Chamber nor its many secrets could be revealed or discussed outside of their group.
	As Hermione followed Harry and Neville out, she turned her head and spotted a glass cabinet full of time turners.
	Miss Black, are you aware that Little Miss Perfect Granger is a known harlot who has used people for her own gain?
	"Ron," Hermione murmured.
	Harry tuned him out as he started talking with the Weasley twins, instead turning to Hermione, Draco and Tom.
	Hermione isn't there but her handbag is missing and he assumes that she's getting ready.
	Hermione felt both Blaise and Pansy swivel to look at her.
	Hermione swiveled her head to her.
	Hermione’s gaze was drawn from her book.
	Draco made a noise in his throat, a noise Hermione knew all too well.
	Hermione answered with the same shrill voice.
	They could see Hermione, her skin glowing and runes flashing.
	Her palm felt nearly as silky as her stockings, and he had been aroused since he’d looked over at Hermione at breakfast.
	Just then she spotted Narcissa welcoming guests into the newly renovated drawing room, and Hermione didn’t know if the nausea she felt was due to Narcissa or seeing the drawing room again.
	Hermione runs down the stairs straight for the portrait hole.
	Alchemy is permanent, but can you tell us why it is permanent, Miss Granger?"
	Hermione could tell that Abraxas did not often hand out such compliments.
	“Come up for tea?” Hermione asked.
	They sat in silence for several minutes, before Hermione tired of the cat and mouse routine said, “Please forgive me sir, but you said we had things to discuss…”  “I’ve done all this and provided you with any information about the dark’s movement that’s been granted to me and you find yourself suspicious of me?” Hermione was breathing hard as she finished her impassioned speech.
	"Excellent," Fleur purred, before her mouth– hot, wet and sensual– was pressed back against Hermione's.
	Hermione asked.
	Hermione took another bite of food and glanced at the large entrance door to the great hall.
	Hermione loved pants; especially a well fitting pair of jeans.
	His eyes caught Draco's for a moment, before moving onto Hermione's chocolate gaze.
	Hermione frowned.
	Hermione sat up and let out a yawn before taking in her surroundings... which were utterly breathtaking.
	Blaise: "I think I'd marry Granger in that scenario.
	Harry and Hermione turned down the left fork of the path and walked swiftly along it as Fang gambolled along a few meters ahead.
	She waved them off, and Hermione headed to London.
	Hermione could breathe again.
	Hermione’s suite Lucius had decided that a Maharaja would most definitely bring his courtesan to a party focused on debauchery and sex – and Hermione Granger made one hell of a courtesan.
	Hermione said, unable to help showing her disappointment at that.
	Hermione was becoming increasingly desperate as all this shouting and noise was doing was attracting more monsters.
	Hermione drew in a deep breath and stood straighter, forcing herself to be calm.
	Hermione held it up to herself in the mirror to see how it looked.
	Draco must have acquiesced, because Hermione gasped loudly and bridged up off Snape’s chest in a spasm of excitement.
	That, Hermione thought, was unnecessarily cryptic.
	Talking about Potions was easy; Hermione could do so all day.
	Hermione shook her head and came back to herself, holding her hand which Tom Riddle had just kissed to her chest.
	‘She cannot.’ Hermione tumbled the words in her mouth for a moment.
	Now, he'd had sex with Hermione twice, depending on the definition of sex.
	But his attire wasn’t what made him look charming to Hermione.
	Hermione shrieked.
	"Pinky," Hermione started slowly, "how long have you been employed by the Malfoy family?"
	"Hey Hermione, can we go get the Horcruxes while Ron is gone?
	"Le Fay translates to 'fairy'," Hermione answered her, ever the star pupil.
	Andy's etiquette lessons, which were also attended by Hermione, took place every Saturday and always ended in a large family dinner at Black Manor with the Tonks' and the Grangers included alongside Remus, Minerva, Bill and Penelope.
	Hermione glanced up.
	Hermione frowned at her blank wall.
	Jackson sighed in relief, but Holloway immediately crushed the hope Hermione knew was forming there.
	"Any time," said Ron before patting Hermione on the hand and getting up to leave.
	Hermione smiled.
	Bellatrix kisses Hermione’s head.
	“Hermione Granger,” I said, taking his hand and hoping my disgust wasn’t evident as I watched him place a wet, open-mouthed kiss across my knuckles.
	Peter swallowed, glanced between Hermione and Anthony and then stood up abruptly and stalked away.
	Hermione stared at him, trembling, as he picked up the box.
	He let Hermione and Leah drag him to Ministry hearings and speeches and propositions like the poster child for squib immersion he sort of was.
	"Nonsense," Miriam said briskly, "from what Hermione said, you saved her from the troll and were playing your broomstick sport when Hermione ended up in the coma.
	Hermione stayed silent for a long moment.
	Hermione had started on a new organizational system for the Malfoy archives, and he didn't dare to file the papers himself for two reasons.
	Hermione was looking at them both, and the glassy look had faded, leaving her sharp-eyed and disapproving.
	Sometimes,” Hermione whispers.
	If anyone was crazy in this relationship it would be Hermione's sanity called into question, not his.
	"Last season, we all celebrated along with Hermione as she found love in the arms of Draco Malfoy."
	Harry doesn’t ask Hermione to dim the light.
	Harry said nothing, and Hermione started stepping around him to leave.
	And Hermione would simply kill him if he drove Patience away, and he did like her, did want her, because she was rare and unique and so…Patience.
	“I…” Hermione swallowed and shivered as his breath ghosted against the shell of her ear, “I’m sorry.
	"I never thought I would sound this much like Luna, but you are as sane as I am," Hermione murmured, trying to restrain her thumbs from stroking Bellatrix's cheek, though she desperately wanted to comfort her.
	Hermione dragged one hand down to his stomach, keening into Draco's mouth when she realized his earlier adjustment had his cock upright, the tip poking above the waistband of his trousers.
	Thirty minutes into the evening, Hermione was surprised at how Slughorn had tossed them about the room, introducing them to four people who would all make excellent resources or clients for Malfoy Consulting.
	In the halls, he found that Hermione was right about the support he had.
	Hermione watched, eyes wide, as a thin beam of silver light formed between the two wands.
	Instantly, and startling Bellatrix, Hermione rose from her seat and shouted into the hallway.
	Hermione went over and perched on the arm of the chair, placing her own arm around Harry's shoulders.
	Hermione lifted one traitorous hand up and gently placed it on Lucius’s shoulder.
	Hermione tensed slightly at her tone.
	“Hello, Hermione.” Luna chimed, not at all bothered by Hermione’s nudity “You’re looking very nice today.” Hermione blushed, but didn’t open her eyes.
	Hermione…is just confused.
	“Five points from Gryffindor for maligning a classmate, Granger.
	Pull the other one, Hermione.” “The Hermione Granger that you know hadn’t met Sirius Black until that ridiculous birthday party for Luna,” Hermione agreed.
	Hermione considered protesting, but in the end just did as the Healer had asked, closing her eyes as Pomfrey carefully pushed up the hospital until she revealed– Hermione didn't say anything, just kept her eyes tightly closed.
	And, possibly most terrifying of all, after being tortured by Bellatrix, Granger had somehow ended up in possession of his Aunt’s wand.
	” Hermione looked at them for help.
	“Granger, if you miscarry, the Dark Lord will have you brought in to examine your mind.” His voice was flat and matter-of-fact, and she flinched at the words.
	Though it was still early in the evening, Hermione found herself once more doling out four drops into a glass of water and drinking it down.
	"Yes," Hermione said, hands on her hips.
	"Dear Hermione, Sat cross-legged on her bed with the early morning sun just beginning to brighten the room, Hermione reread the letter again and carefully folded it up before tucking it between the pages of her book on meditation.
	By the time this last kiss ended Hermione was dazed and dizzy, she didn’t even notice that Theo guided her to a chair and was serving her tea.
	He was so glad he had Hermione.
	“MMMMMHHHHH!” Hermione screamed, muffled by Ginny’s mouth, as her own orgasm barreled through her.
	The woman sucked her teeth and glared at Hermione.
	‘I love you, Hermione,’  he said, and then she felt him filling her, all of her.
	Hermione couldn't even remember the last time she'd seen a nice smile.
	Hermione ended up on her back, paws in the air, Bellatrix standing over her on all fours.
	Hermione murmured to the older boy who gave her a cocky grin.
	Dressed, and clean and fresh from the shower, Hermione walks downstairs and into the kitchen.
	Hermione hugged her back, realizing she was shaking with adrenaline.
	Hermione smiled, stifling her own burst of laughter as she turned back to Remus, and thanking Ron as he re-entered the kitchen with the small bottle of healing extract.
	He ushered Hermione and Harry out of the door.
	Hermione takes advantage of the chaos from the Order speaking with Harry's uncle and hooks her arms through Fred and George's, dragging them off with her.
	Stays leaning against Hermione, just looking at Neville.
	"Hermione is right, Harry."
	Hermione asked, surprised.
	Hermione blinked and tried not to think about how much money Draco was spending by keeping multiple hotel suites constantly at his disposal.
	"There is no affair," Hermione replied.
	"A pleasure to meet you, Miss Granger."
	“You should get some sleep,” Hermione whispers back.
	Hermione's vision blurred as she stared at the elf, wobbling beneath the weight of the heavy chain around his neck.
	Hermione cleared her throat.
	Hermione shoved through the crowds, scaling over the stands and dropping over the edges, falling almost ten feet down to the ground below.
	He looked at the empty clearing and then at Hermione.
	Mrs. Norris, the sweet-natured feline who Iago, the tomcat who'd been Hermione's constant companion for so many years, had chosen as his mate and was pregnant with his kittens.
	Hermione’s heart sank, but she pulled on her cloak and followed him docilely.
	"The Granger girl, and both the Thomas and Malone boy in particular.
	Hermione laughed, eyes watery.
	No doubt Hermione would approve of her diligence.
	“You’re still one of the prettiest girls I know,” Hermione told her.
	The papers seemed quite full of Harry and Draco’s fictitious fight over Hermione after the Christmas break, including a number of technically accurate but very misleading quotes from Draco himself.
	“I want to know, Hermione,” he went on silkily, his voice low.
	Hermione shook her head and steadied herself.
	Hermione: "A spa?"
	[Hermione storms in, talking to herself and pacing.]
	We should…" She didn't finish and an invisible wave of Ginny's magic knocked Hermione backwards sending her sprawling along with Draco and Marcus.
	Jack, you are not at fault for what happened to Hermione.
	"Hermione?"
	“Hermione…you’re going to have to switch your answers,” Ginny says in laughing shock.
	I know you're Harry's best friend and that you're friends with Ron and Hermione."
	"Valentine's Day gift for Hermione."
	Hermione squealed again but he was ready for her hug and grinned at her beaming face.
	Hermione nodded back, and moved quickly to the doorway, following Draco out.
	Slipping it onto his finger felt like coming home; it was a similar sort of feeling he got being around Tom, and even Voldemort, one he guessed was related to the tethers (there was probably an actual name for the tethers, and it was definitely suspicious that Marvolo hadn't told it to him, but Harry had faith that now Hermione had something solid to go off, she'd find out what it was– not to mention, he currently had access to a pretty impressive library too).
	“We’re leaving,” he repeated tightly, and Hermione watched with a dark, building anger as Dumbledore practically dragged Harry away.
	“I know.” Hermione tapped a finger against the spine of her book.
	“It’s okay, Severus,” Hermione said softly, quickly recovering from the fresh bought of tears.
	Hermione chuckled.
	Hermione doesn’t even bother watching the rest.
	Hermione grins and catches her in a hug.
	"I am, and that's the thing," said Hermione.
	Hermione At 12:58 on Saturday, Hermione clings tightly to her parents.
	She frowned as she caught something behind Hermione.
	Hermione froze, her hands tightening around the mug.
	She dodged Hermione and laughing she sprinted to stand behind the sofa that Draco and Theo were sitting on.
	Hermione recast a diagnostic and watched the inflammation rapidly fade away.
	If Hermione didn't know any better, at least.
	Narcissa had protested lightly, but so long as Hermione only wore the trousers around the house over the school breaks, she let the matter drop.
	"Of course it was," Hermione said rolling her eyes.
	Hermione put her hand over one of Draco's as he spoke directly to the baby.
	Hermione was surprised – they seemed to know each other.
	Looking back at Theo, Hermione cupped his cheek, her thumb brushing against his heated cheek, “How about we show them what you taught me,” she said with a mischievous glint in her eye.
	Hermione closes her eyes, a headache of her own forming as she tries to piece everything together.
	You-Know-Who would have to have half of his Death Eaters searching the entire world for the Grangers and they'd never get close."
	Hermione turned away to write the final name on the black board.
	Standing in front of the mirror, Hermione clasped and unclasped the necklace Dumbledore had given her.
	So when the pop of apparition cracked across the leaves and flowers, Hermione dropped her coffee cup, shattering it when Mippy arrived in front of her.
	So they were going with plan B— or plan R, as Hermione had called it, for 'plan reckless'.
	Hermione struggled to come up with more to say to him.
	Hermione shrugged.
	She flashed Granger an annoyed look.
	Hermione felt herself melting in their glow, but her liquefied insides insisted on coming out through her eyes, and for several minutes she couldn’t see anything except a sea of saltwater.
	Draco, Blaise, Vince, Greg and Hermione remained, waiting for the champions to return with the professors.
	Hermione asked, worried, as she cranked her head to look up at Remus only to catch him sharing a knowing look with his wife.
	"Granger, that's just not possible," he chuckled.
	Sirius ruffled his hair, and Harry dodged him to nod a greeting at Hermione who slid her hand into Harry's while ostensibly ignoring her smirking parents behind her.
	Yes, Hermione thought, as her brain sought out its pleasure through her hazy intoxication.
	Hermione looked behind her as the tunnel re-sealed itself, its glowing frame fading back into the appearance of brick-and-concrete.
	“Hey, Hermione.
	Hermione almost laughed at the look that crossed her husband’s face.
	When Hermione asked him why he was here?"
	Hermione rubbed harder, twisting her hand awkwardly to get her knuckles into his hairline.
	Hermione Granger, left Hogwarts with Eleven NEWTS.
	“Ugh, my head,” Hermione moaned as she came to.
	The edge of a blade caught the moonlight, and Hermione's chest locked in horror as the tip pressed against her skin.
	"You can't have mummy's milk anymore baby," Hermione pleaded.
	Smiling, Hermione slid her hand along Snape’s side, her palm upturned in a tactile peace offering.
	"Oh Dolores," Hermione cried, reaching down and lifting Umbridge up, "You must be careful around the doors, people never look anymore do they?"
	Hermione couldn't help but pick up on that immediately.
	"Hermione, Angelina escaped by killing Macnair and cutting off her arm.
	Hermione repeated the word, making a displeased face as she spoke.
	A disappearance Hermione caused."
	Hermione took a sip of her drink.
	Dorea set a bottle each of oil and vinegar in front of Hermione, summoning a glass jar from another cabinet.
	Draco glanced up, catching sight of Hermione across the room.
	Hermione closes the book uncomfortably.
	Hermione let out a sigh, sitting down at the pool again while pulling her blanket over her legs.
	Hermione gave her a curious look.
	Hermione hummed and twisted enough to tip her head up to him.
	Hermione was never one for quiet contemplation.
	Inside, Hermione Granger did a little, private victory jig.
	“Hermione, bloody hell?
	Regulus froze and stared at Hermione with horror.
	Which was channeling pure Hermione, of course.
	"Don't be silly," said Hermione, yet she hoped that Hepzibah was right.
	But Hermione had consider that while Evelyn Greengrass was Bellatrix' past, she was her future.
	Hermione turned to Daphne.
	Hermione nods back.
	"Hermione," said Bellatrix in a hushed voice, not looking at her but making a hand-gesture at her to remain quiet.
	Turning, he fixed his attention on Hermione.
	“Hermione sweetie, I know it hurts, but everything is going to be fine honey.
	"You can still leave, Hermione," Kinglsey said lowly.
	Hermione smiled gratefully to Narcissa and called for Tipsy to serve them tea.
	Hermione began her goodbyes, getting inundated with little gifts and enchanted trinkets she had no use for.
	"You must be the veela girl," he said softly and Harry wanted to both step back and step in front of Fleur– Tom would treat him and Hermione right, he knew, but there was no such promise in place for their friends who existed on the thin ice that everyone but the two of them stood on.
	Hermione’s cheeks grew hot, and she dropped her eyes.
	"It's me who should be apologizing," Hermione rushed, heat creeping up her neck.
	"No—I mean," Hermione walked over to him.
	Warmth blossomed in Hermione’s chest.
	Hermione couldn't help but laugh, already planning on getting him to return the favour when they returned to the dorms.
	She sat up and looked away from Hermione.
	Now as they rode in the carriage, Hermione could not deny she was still desperately, horribly aroused.
	There was no mention of remaining together until parted by death, nor of sickness and health, and for that, Hermione was grateful.
	Sirius sat down next to Hermione on a settee.
	Hermione buried her head in his chest and pulled him closer.
	"Granger," he said dryly, "I will walk out of this room right now if you don't stop talking."
	Hermione gave a small smile, sensing she had a modicum of power here, after all.
	The man smiled greasily at them and Hermione was about to explain that they were lost when he spoke first.
	With Hermione petrified, it all felt like too much work anyway.
	Hermione nodded slowly.
	Hermione laughed despite her desolate mood.
	Which means that our focus should be on protecting Miss Granger until we have a way to capture the woman.” Unfortunately, Hermione is the latter; otherwise we would be able to bring Bellatrix to us instead.” “Yes, this particular group council has been assembled so as to determine if a full suppression of Hermione Jean Granger’s inheritance is our only viable option.” “Miss Granger has yet to have an incident requiring such treatment!” Flitwick agreed.
	Hermione hoped it would be enough.
	Hermione took a deep breath.
	Hermione looks around the crowded common room.
	Hermione sat upright, pulling out of his embrace.
	She’s Hermione Granger.
	Be bold, Hermione!
	Hermione allowed her agreement to come to the forefront of her mind.
	Hermione chuckles.
	He had defied Voldemort for Harry and Hermione before, after all.
	All of them making him more and more frustrated with Hermione.
	Hermione is still gaping at the pen, which Narcissa is calmly making notes with.
	"In the bedroom, he likes it when you…" she made a gesture with her hands that caused Hermione to flush a deep red, and Molly threw her head back and laughed genuinely at Hermione's reaction.
	Hermione sighed with relief as the last of the snitches was returned to the box.
	While Hermione appreciated a spontaneous lubing as much as the next witch, the humiliation currently fricasseeing her face made it difficult to embrace such a profusion of arousal.
	It turns out, Hermione Granger, illustrious war heroine and moral crusader, has been dating none other than Draco Malfoy, former Death Eater and current International Liaison for the Ministry.
	Three curses flew simultaneously towards the blonde, and an exasperated Hermione pushed Draco out of the way, at the same time as Tom viciously responded, knocking the three Weasleys unconscious, leaving a splatter of blood on the surrounding tree trunks.
	But Hermione was a world unto herself.
	Hermione bit her tongue.
	Hermione felt she looked vaguely familiar but couldn’t place her.
	For her part, Hermione nestled her head against her chest while being held.
	Hermione pushed a pot of raspberry jam, his favorite flavor, over to him in consolation.
	Hermione blinked.
	Keep talking, Hermione.
	“Come for me, Hermione.
	Hermione gaped when Riddle walked right into that yawning mouth, but when she moved to get a better look, she could see why.
	Hermione fought to keep her breathing regular.
	Hermione cried out in surprise, writhing against his tongue.
	“You’re telling me that you didn’t automatically know?” Hermione teased.
	Hermione could see that she actually hadn’t, but she was also quite aware that what was happening right now was not normal.
	He was thinking about Hermione's raised hand ignored in Potions, or the way Snape had sneered that he didn't see a difference in her cursed teeth.
	Hermione’s throat went dry.
	Hermione stared in horror and dropped her disillusionment.
	Hermione looked quite pleased with his kiss.
	Hermione’s mouth fell open as Severus re-trained his eyes back on her.
	Hermione’s heart sank a little at the mention of the older witch and the concerns from the weekend crept in, but she stuck her tongue out at Ginny and then laughed at her own childishness.
	"Gwen," Hermione says, cutting him off.
	“Granger, come on, you need to come back up.” She heard a voice saying, it was shaking faintly.
	Hermione felt like all the air had been sucked out of the room.
	Ludo Bagman laughed and beckoned George to his side, but Hermione could see he was grey.
	Hermione made sure there would be no special plans prohibiting them from attending.
	Hermione giggled at the comical expression on Draco's face.
	Hermione didn't have Draco's memory and wasn't able to recall everything she'd read, not without intense study and review, but now that she thought about it, she realized her name had come up in at least half of the questions before Narcissa snapped into wild raving.
	"I'm not interested in that sort of dominance and submission play," he agreed easily, "my interests are focused in sadomasochism– as I suspect yours are too, Hermione."
	Hermione was still out of it even as Ron picked her up, threw her over his shoulder, and began running for the floo network.
	Hermione's expression was eerily blank, a sure sign that she was planning something that had the potential to be quite... fatal.
	Hermione smiled at him.
	Hermione nodded.
	Mrs. Weasley returned with a book in hand, a book Hermione quickly identified as another copy of 'The Short and Tragic Life of Bellatrix Black'.
	And even though Harry guesses it has something to do with Ron and Hermione being around, he detests it.
	So avoid Poppy and Padma,” Hermione’s mouth twitched faintly, “if you have anyone you think needs a few days off, they’re the ones you should go see.” Hermione stood up.
	Hermione, I don’t understand why you are so upset.
	Then Hermione let out a muffled squeal and started to whisper furiously with a huge grin on her face.
	Miss Granger may very well end up being like Bellatrix if we do this.
	Hermione laughed weakly.
	"Edward Jessup," Hermione read from the file.
	“Do you know,” says Hermione, after a long pause, “I think I’m going to have another drink.”  Hermione stands, takes their glasses and then, with a little shake of her head, baby Rose.
	He cursed under his breath and tossed down his drink knowing the time of the Dark Lord returning was upon them and so it was best to spend his time in getting Hermione ready to meet her new master.
	Hermione veered off to the left of where she was; limping her way towards what she was hoping was an exit.
	“Any change?” Hermione asked, leaning down and examining the injury alongside Poppy.
	Draco was clearly annoyed at how genuinely surprised Hermione looked that he had known something.
	Hermione didn’t want to admit it, but her pride was brutally stung.
	Hermione whimpers.
	“Then you put on shoes.” She lifts Hermione’s foot.
	"Picking something for us to call you is a tradition mixed with a safety measure," Hermione explained, "if any of us get picked up by the police, it's better that we don't know each other's names."
	“Merlin, Hermione.
	Lord Slytherin, it turned out, would go to great lengths to protect Miss Granger and Miss Greengrass.
	Hermione’s eyes narrowed and flashed with fire as she looked at the simpering man.
	Spots Hermione.
	"And is research also how you've prepared for the practical application of this deception, Granger?"
	Hermione had avoided Bellatrix since last morning.
	Several large hands grabbed hold of Hermione and started trying to pull her in multiple directions all at once.
	Hermione, Neville and Luna cheered loudly for their friend, amongst the crowds of other Gryffindors and Ginny did a celebratory loop of the stands, her arm raised victoriously.
	Thirteen!” Hermione sobbed, feeling herself draw closer.
	“And he told Amanda that it went well and he’s excited to see you again next month!” Ginny was pouring tea and forcing Hermione to relive the date Monday night.
	"Hermione," he murmured when he was close enough to touch, to lean forwards and drag his teeth over the bruises he'd left on her neck.
	Hermione studied her for a moment before she raised her wand.
	"Impatient," Hermione said, but he could see the anxiety in her eyes too and didn't take what she said to heart.
	Between Remus's romantic misadventures, Penny's broken-ish heart, and Harry's first foray into love with Hermione, Sirius felt surrounded.
	Shaking her head, Hermione murmured, “What I tell you stays between you and I?” It was a combination of a request and a question.
	Hermione's mother scooped the happy infant up happily.
	Letting the skirts of her dress pool around her as she slid down his body, Hermione had to bite back a laugh at the startled sound Harry made.
	Hermione flinches back out of sight.
	“She was a stuntwoman,” Hermione says quickly.
	"Hermione loves your tattoo design.
	Witches and wizards more often wore stylish, muggle-appropriate attire than anything long and robe-like, too, which Hermione was quite happy about.
	"As much as I would love being bound to Hermione for eternity," he said interrupting the heated exchange, "I would not put her life at risk, no matter what I may stand to gain as a result."
	Impatiently brushing the hair from her eyes, she repeated the words from Sirius in a harsh tone, “‘Don’t touch Hermione, don’t look at Hermione, don’t lick Hermione.’  Sound familiar?” “Is…” His eyes flicked between James, Remus and Hermione with rapid speed.
	Hermione asked with a small voice and a heavy heart.
	Hermione made a face.
	Or were they planning on killing Bellatrix and taking Hermione as some kind of prize?
	Hermione was serving detention for cursing Weasley– the only consolation was that Weasley had also been given detention because he'd thrown the first curse–  so it was just him.
	Pansy’s mouth twitched and Hermione wanted to bang her head against the wall.
	Hermione rolled her eyes, although she could not stop a small smile from ghosting across her lips.
	Fleur lets go of Hermione.
	She needed all the brain space she could spare to tap dance around Granger being outed and she didn't need braindead simple academic assignments getting in the way.
	"It's not that," Hermione mumbled into his chest.
	Abraxas took a sip of his own, and, seeing no way out of at least trying it, Hermione followed suit.
	Their fears were confirmed when a curtain was pulled back to reveal Hermione.
	Hermione swayed in Luna's arms as they moved together to the music.
	“Hermione,” Abraxas exhaled shakily, his words mostly inaudible, though Tom knew exactly what he’d said.
	"I... Bellatrix and I..." Hermione smiled briefly.
	Hermione's funeral.
	“Miss Granger,” he said, and his voice was liquid ice.
	Hermione exclaimed, clapping a hand over her mouth as she felt tears of joy springing to her eyes.
	“Fair,” Ginny yawned before following Hermione down the rest of the stairs and through the common room, towards the exit.
	I feel like there could have been something deeper there, and in my mind I borrow from JKR’s idea of her sister—that they either had a miscarriage or Hermione had a sister and lost her and she doesn’t want her parents to go through that again.
	Hermione’s eyes closed, as a jagged pain tore through her heart.
	From Daphne: a wordless scoff, though Hermione caught her looking.
	“I thought a basilisk must have dragged you down the plug hole,” Parvati commented as Hermione returned to the bedroom.
	His father may have married her, but Hermione would always be his.
	"I summarized for Ron, Vince and Greg," Hermione added.
	Muggles, Resistance fighters; they were all being brought to Hermione and Padma.
	Hermione wrinkled her forehead.
	Hermione sat by the fire, untangling her wet hair as she watched Bellatrix head over to where they had storied the potion.
	Turning back to Hermione, Snape set the play in motion, tickling the shell of her ear with the tip of his tongue.
	Hermione had to dig her fingers into her palms to banish the images her mind conjured.
	Then," Hermione said, waving her empty glass in the air.
	What was most difficult for Hermione in that moment was remaining still and calm.
	Draco slowly pulled away from Hermione's kiss and gave her a wink.
	Even Ginny knew some details through Harry, so Hermione was the only one trying to catch up.
	he asked, and Hermione leaned forwards slightly to press her lips against his ear.
	“What would you wish for?” Hermione asked, even though she was certain she already knew the answer.
	Hermione gave him a long, searching look.
	And Hermione had forgotten about her.
	Hermione closed her mouth and shut her eyes to suck hard on his finger, drawing her tongue around it to lick her own taste off his skin.
	Hermione's mind whirred.
	Hermione’s mind raced for a solution, her panic rising.
	“Swallow this,” Hermione forced a potion to counter his internal organ damage down his throat, followed by a restorative and then a strengthening potion.
	Ron nods, Hermione nods too, and Harry is grateful.
	Hermione nodded.
	By one whiny third year doing her damnedest to get killed, Hermione thought bitterly.
	Hermione’s right.
	“Hermione, if Severus had had the potion and had been faced with your choice, he would have saved you instead of Harry.” Hermione squeezed her eyes shut.
	It was utterly gorgeous, and Hermione was astonished once more on what something as simple as a hair style could accomplish in terms of both her appearance and her confidence.
	Hermione countered.
	"I could have gone without hearing that, thank you very much," Hermione clipped, wrinkling her nose.
	The room spun, and Hermione braced herself on the wall.
	Tonks looked at Fred and then Hermione and smiled knowingly, "Sure, I heard your dad's tinkering with radios again-" Hermione watched as they walked through another curtain and turned to Fred with a shadow of a smile, "So your brother, Remus and Tonks know about us?"
	"Better," Hermione said.
	Hermione padded in to the kitchen, finding Bellatrix setting the table.
	Harry and Hermione were the ones who couldn’t show their faces at Hogwarts without starting a miniature war.
	Hermione stood staring after him dazedly.
	She stood tall from the window, clasped Hermione's shoulder, and exited the room, leaving Hermione with a thousand arguments on her lips and no one to scream at.
	Hermione’s fingers went slack and instead of insistent bucking, her hips were now absently gyrating within the range of movement Harry was allowing.
	An accident, like Hermione?
	Hermione was reminded of her wolf eyes; how she had imagined they would look when hunting.
	Hermione reflexively covers her chest.
	"So what're you going to do with the Daily Prophet, Hermione?"
	Lily was long dead and as such, Hermione had no wish to compete with her.
	Hermione stared at her knees.
	“Who, Granger?” Draco asked feigning boredom.
	When they were planning to be in the room of requirement, Hermione could have just been separated from them- giving the couple some privacy.
	He felt her nails dig into his flesh and the sting shot more heat to his groin, his cock so hard he thought it might bore a hole into Hermione’s belly.
	Tracey could only stare as Hermione carefully dropped one of the clothes filled leather bags into it.
	Lucius then turned his eyes to Hermione who had her own mask of indifference in place, meeting his eyes with a bored, assessing look of her own.
	Hermione felt nearly speechless.
	Hermione: [sighs] "No, we really won't."
	Hermione fidgeted nervously in the waiting room, her throat tight.
	The warm head of his greased cock brushed against her buttocks, and Hermione froze, wanting nothing more than for him to finally fill her.
	Hermione tossed the Floo powder, stepped into the fire, and the moment his fingers wrapped around her skin, she yelled, "Malfoy Manor!"
	"I'd better," Hermione spoke before she caught herself and quickly focused to devouring a particularly hearty bit of mushroom.
	She paused, watching Theo and Hermione lean forward.
	Hermione had nodded, looking around the room.
	She scratched her scalp again as she moaned and Bellatrix inhaled sharply against her before growling and curling her fingers, making Hermione gasp too.
	Both Lord and Lady Malfoy’s attention snapped to Hermione’s necklace, all inappropriate flirtation forgotten.
	"Hermione — I tried to contact you.
	Hermione felt very much the same in that regard.
	"You slept with Hermione!
	"Just do it, Granger.
	“Ariana, if you could alert me when Harry and Hermione are recovered enough for further conversation.” Dumbledore requests politely.
	After a beat of deliberation, Hermione groaned and followed behind Sirius.
	He teased Hermione, as he held the snitch reverently, tracing one of the delicate-looking wings with the tip of a finger.
	"And I'm going home for the holidays," Hermione said, fully intending to spend the holidays with her parents again.
	Hermione Granger was just a Muggle-born witch who helped Harry Potter, wasn't she?
	How did Granger bring this out in him with absolutely no effort?
	Hermione tried to scream but the sound was muffled so she viciously bit down as hard as she could on the hand over her mouth only to let go in agony when Greyback increased the force behind his bite.
	"I hate nicknames," Hermione repeated, narrowing her eyes at James.
	She moved to the edge of her chair and extended her hand until her painted fingers rested on the canvas beneath Hermione’s.
	"No," replied Hermione with a grin.
	She hooks her arm through Hermione’s.
	The last part was mumbled and Hermione was pleased that she'd had three years already of interpreting Ron.
	Hermione's face scrunched up in a rictus of concentration.
	The older witch left and Hermione went upstairs to check on Ted and Teddy and to ask him if there was anything in particular she should prepare for dinner.
	Hermione wanted to stop and ask for forgiveness.
	Hermione had known—but she still felt a sharp ache in her chest when she heard the confirmation.
	Hermione knew this from growing up with the woman "buzzing" around her, but it was only her familiarity with Skeeter that allowed her to read between the lines.
	“That’s perfect, though,” Hermione was caught up in the plans unfolding rapidly in her mind.
	Take care of Hermione for me.
	Hermione bites her lip.
	Hermione straightened up and wiped her cheeks.
	Hermione blinked.
	Hermione pleaded.
	Hermione had told him that the Ravenclaws had different motives than the Slytherins, and apparently he had paid more attention than she’d realized.
	"You've got something in mind already," he observed and Hermione's grin widened to show teeth.
	Hermione perked up.
	As the joined, multi-colored thread twisted back to the marks, so that each person had two threads over his or her arm, creating a loop that disappeared into the mark, Hermione spoke the accompanying words, “In each other, we find our strength.
	Mechanically, Harry gets to his feet, tugs on his clothing, and without a word hands Hermione back her cloak.
	You're more than welcome to borrow it, Hermione.
	Hermione wondered if his voice was tightening, or if it was solely her own throat, slowly restricting her airflow as she tried to suck in low, sharp breaths.
	She just saved that man’s life.” Lucius wrapped his arm around Hermione’s shoulders and led her quickly out of the main room, pulling her into his and Snape’s managerial office.
	Hermione pulls on some underwear and jeans from a chest of drawers.
	The Hermione who had those big, brown sad eyes when she thought no one was looking, or when she was trying to be happy.
	Hermione shook her head, sadly.
	Was it any wonder that Hermione was Tom’s soul mate?
	Harry said politely from beside her, and Hermione opened her mouth to say her own goodbye when Karkaroff bustled up to them.
	It's something Hermione brought up after she got her wand."
	It had been Hermione's one opportunity to kill her, and she'd missed.
	Hermione doesn’t want to tease.
	“Like what you see?” Hermione smiled, glowing at his awed response to her body.
	That being said, Hermione would not let the woman win.
	Draco blinked open his eyes, and Hermione inhaled sharply.
	There in front of her stood the gorgeous, tall, and impossibly slim form of the witch Hermione had only ever known as Narcissa Malfoy.
	So, with that, Luna and Harry leave the Room of Requirement, leaving Hermione and Ron to field all the questions thrown at them.
	Hermione asked.
	she asked, and the girl reacted, still not letting go of Hermione, but turning her head away from her robes.
	“Granger,” was all he said by way of greeting before he kissed her.
	"Yes, okay," Hermione lied, fully intending to never return, but Bill caught her by the elbow.
	Hermione stared up into Draco’s eyes and felt as though she were liquid gold.
	Hermione startled from her thoughts.
	Harry shrugs, and tries to look like he doesn’t care that Hermione was talking to Malfoy and he doesn’t know what about.
	She could only watch, powerless, as Luna's animagus form somehow managed to corner all three of the animals against the very cliffs she'd wanted Hermione to take refuge around, in a closed valley with no exit.
	Hermione nodded.
	Hermione wondered why Bellatrix was stalling.
	“Hermione.
	Hermione giggled.
	he asked as he refilled both his and Hermione's pumpkin juice from the carafe, oblivious of her astonished reaction.
	Striga had called him home from his date and practice with Hermione to deal with a bad situation.
	Harry had been there, keeping Hermione company during what had been a quiet afternoon.
	For the first time since Britt had stood, Hermione looked at her face.
	Hermione gave him a smirk.
	But Hermione didn’t want Hepzibah to know she was corresponding with that shop boy either, if she could help it.
	He seemed incredibly uncomfortable, and Hermione had never seen his garments be anything less than perfect.
	“Please.” Hermione looked longingly up at him and tried to grind against his erection.
	"My… reaction… last night will likely bring up some red flags for him—yes, Hermione?"
	Luckily, Blaise noticed Draco's struggle and reached out to gently tug Hermione away.
	After their classes, Ron and Hermione met them in the library before dinner.
	You were made for greater things, Hermione.
	"Hermione is beloved by many students, as I'm sure you're aware," Albus said.
	"Very well, Miss Granger."
	“I’m not a Quidditch player, Hermione,” he said, eyes flitting nervously around the room.
	What are you really after by keeping Hermione?
	Hermione thought back to the first time she had encountered Bellatrix Lestrange: she was in the Department of Mysteries with Harry facing off with Lucius Malfoy.
	Hermione nods sadly.
	She returned it, although more gently, before she found herself watching Hermione pull away and take off sprinting down the corridor.
	“You didn’t!” Hermione was aghast, and even Tom looked stunned.
	"I don't see how I could push Draco towards Hermione anymore than I already have."
	Justin had done something similar to Hermione in modifying his parent's memories shortly after Charity Burbage's disappearance.
	“Miss Granger, you look stunning.
	Hermione aims Snape’s wand at Bellatrix’s heart.
	Harry nodded, yawning, as Hermione insisted she knew this because every year her family would do their Christmas Shopping there, and at six o'clock they'd meet back at the Statue of Eros, with gift-laden bags on their arms.
	Hermione swallows.
	"Miss Weasley, Miss Granger; something you'd like to share with the class?"
	“This will do, Miss Granger.” Hermione stared at the mask unblinkingly for a breath of time before slowly reaching out to take it from the wizard.
	Hermione handed Harry a third book.
	She was beginning to think that they might have the situation under control, if only the aurors would bloody well get there, when Lestrange plunged through the steam, landing right between Ginny and Hermione.
	"Just a few, but I haven't seen the Grangers or Mrs Thomas yet."
	Hermione sinks slowly back down into her chair, wanting to interject and yet simultaneously finding this moment to be necessary.
	Hermione wasn't sure what until Severus arrived, and Tonks pounced.
	“I’m going to be this way for the rest of my life, Gin,” Hermione said, “I have to figure out a better solution than always needing a friend walk me.” “I would mind it,” Hermione said firmly.
	Draco's heart thudded in his chest; he hadn't known Riddle knew about Granger.
	Remus had coerced Sirius into staying behind with him so Hermione could have time to herself and she was grateful.
	"Don't be silly, Ginny," Hermione said kindly, going over and pulling her friend in to a hug.
	“Not that.” Hermione shook her head.
	Do it!” Hermione knew the moment he began to cum, when the heat in his balls boiled over and erupted through his shaft.
	Beside her, Charlie had gone very still in recognition of the danger that they were in (well, probably in; Tonks didn't think she'd done anything that would have Hermione Granger wanting her dead quite yet).
	Pansy came at her with a large makeup brush at that point, promptly covering Hermione's embarrassed flush with a beige goo.
	Daphne, you're going to be on Harry Potter polyjuice duty if it's needed, Hermione, you're the second polyjuice backup.
	With a deep sigh, Hermione took a step back and lowered the knife.
	Hermione could feel in that moment a pulse of shivering dread snake down her spine.
	Hermione's alarmed voice had him groaning softly under his breath before he lifted his head off his knees to face the very worried witch being led to him by Sycorax.
	Hermione pulls back slightly to meet her eye, a sudden thought.
	Hermione felt cold.
	"Well, he's certainly not an upstanding citizen," Hermione grumbled, though she softened slightly.
	Hermione blurted out.
	Minerva smiled tightly, and Hermione could not help but smile in return.
	"Of course," Hermione took the parcel and tried to take a bag from her for good measure.
	Draco's fist clenches around his wand, not because he's bothered by the idea of her attacking him, but because he has a sneaking suspicion Granger's come to take it from him — not that he'll let her.
	“Hang on a moment,” Hermione calls crossly after him.
	It was rare for Hermione to miscalculate, but when Dobby popped in beside her and prevented her from touching the avalanche of mail just delivered to her by a flock of owls, she was prepared to admit that perhaps she had grossly underestimated the public interest in her relationship with Harry.
	"H-Hermione?!"
	Hermione felt her throat tighten as she approached the dark-haired girl.
	"Hermione?"
	Hermione rolled her eyes at the annoying girl and summoned a miniature sausage from a tureen of them with a flick of her wrist.
	"I really hope it's you, Granger, and not my father teasing me with your scent.
	Hermione cleared her throat importantly.
	"Hermione," he whispered, his fingers tracing the outline of her head. "
	"Well, I thought you'd never ask," drawled the nutcracker-prince, his hair glinting amid the snow's pale sheen as he turned to Hermione.
	Hermione exploded.
	"That's—obscene," Hermione finally said.
	Hermione hurriedly moves further into the doorway as it opens.
	Hermione sighed.
	Hermione asked.
	Too winded to laugh, Hermione sputtered out a giggle.
	She pulls back to grin at Hermione.
	And of the two, war is a lot worse," Hermione quoted and then smiled sadly.
	“Hermione also goes to see Ginevra Weasley play for the Holyhead Harpies,” Luna added.
	“Are you wearing my pyjamas?” Hermione asks.
	It was petty and completely beneath her, but Hermione simply couldn’t contain the slight cock of her eyebrow and the gloating smirk she gave the other woman as she passed her.
	Hermione: "Totally fine."
	Still unsure how to discuss the situation with her husband or how to respond to Miranda, Hermione read in the Library for an hour, researching the Dark Arts and the implications of Necromancy for a few quiet minutes, until a grandfather clock in the far corner chimed 5 o’clock, and she knew it was time for her to meet Snape in the dining room.
	“Hermione?” a new voice choked out.
	Hermione goes stiff.
	Stealing glances at Severus, Hermione saw he had folded his arms and was looking down at the carpet, patiently waiting for the shameful interlude to be over.
	That was probably for the best, Hermione decided; there were enough students struggling with an odd attraction to the biggest git at Hogwarts, and revealing any positive aspects would just encourage them.
	She has a lot of brothers," he added with a little wink at Hermione.
	Tom and Hermione just want to give each other the best!
	Then she turned to Hermione, and pulled the brunette aside.
	Hermione was breathing very quickly as she turned back around, confused.
	“Professor,” Hermione said quietly, once again not meeting his eyes as she looked out over the garden.
	“Then, with so much water, the glass will have to be half-full, at least, right?” Hermione smiled so widely her face ached.
	He's the perfect gentleman and Hermione can't seem to stop blushing around him what with all the compliments he's doling out to her.
	Not only with your Krampus routine but also with them witnessing you practically devouring me,” Hermione’s multi-faceted eyes sparkled with love and mischief as the figure of Krampus stood tall, the horns, dark fur and fangs melting away to reveal the handsome visage of Tom Riddle.
	Startled, Hermione turned slightly to see Blaise standing with his wand out, something very dangerous present in his eyes.
	Although Draco and Narcissa's actions to protect Harry been well publicized in their trials that had led to their ultimate releases, Hermione seethed as she recalled how Lucius had somehow managed to slip by on their coattails, having his own trial sealed and forgotten by the public among the chaos of the plague so that he'd been exempt from returning to Azkaban despite all of his transgressions.
	“Grandmother,” Hermione said slowly, “I wanted you to know that I was going to take Mystery out for a ride this morning.” Hermione looked down at herself and gave a small laugh, “Yes, I’m sure that  was  a dead giveaway, but I also wanted to let you know I planned on going to the pond and maybe do some ice-skating.” “Yes, Mum and papa used to take me every Boxing day,” Hermione explained as fast as she could feeling the lump in her throat start to form.
	Hermione frowns.
	Hermione and Ron had hardly been together.
	Hermione looks over at Augusta Longbottom.
	It's scaring me, Hermione.
	That night, as the obligatory 'Gryffindor is Better Than All the Other Houses For Whatever We've Managed to Do Now' party was winding down, Hermione and Ron cornered him and cast a privacy charm to the area they were standing in.
	Fred, George, and Ginny continued to stare at Harry and Hermione like they were insane.
	A chill, stronger than Hermione's desk crept over them.
	Hermione was ashamed to realize that Monsieur DuBois would be quite proud of her as she recognized many famous paintings and styles.
	He pressed his lips together and gave Hermione an apologetic look.
	Hermione had stared at him, but she found no hidden meaning in his words.
	Hermione dismissed herself from Dumbledore’s office.
	Raising an eyebrow, Hermione took another drink.
	Hermione just gives him a look, resisting the urge to groan into her hands.
	Dodging out of its path, he closed one hand around Granger's wrist.
	Harry knew that Hermione was fierce, tough as nails and, above all else, a survivor but he also knew that living on the streets was dangerous and he was scared for her.
	Having a go with Snape was startling enough, but having Granger witness their first kiss was positively nerve-wracking.
	Hermione nods to herself in the mirror.
	Hermione thanked him with a thin smile and turned in the direction of the lifts, dismissing him.
	Barely stopping herself from blanching, Hermione took another short, sharp breath, reaching out blindly with the hand not holding up the quilt to pick up the nearest potion, swallow it down with a grimace and then repeat the process.
	Hermione smiled and shook her head, “Not that I can think of.
	Hermione questioned.
	The room went quite and Hermione tried to think.
	Bellatrix… Hermione briefly manages to think.
	Hermione picked it up, marveling at how beautiful she looked.
	Draco, who now, according to Hermione, was family.
	Hermione stared in open-mouthed disbelief as Bellatrix Lestrange strode across the carpet towards her; the dark witch looked as she always had — beautiful, ethereal, and mad as a chair.
	“Spend more time around him— her— them?” Hermione frowns.
	Hermione said, standing to cross the room, over to where her locked trunk rested against the wall.
	She listened to him swallow a large gulp of red wine, and when she wiggled closer, he shifted beneath her with a "That's enough, Granger," before tossing back the rest of his wine and removing her from his lap.
	Hermione gave a small gasp and stood clutching her wand, her chest jerking unevenly as she tried to breathe.
	Hermione chewed her lip, then leaned forward, taking a closer look at their plant.
	It wasn't a particularly nice smile, but Hermione wasn't looking for nice and she smiled right back as pulled out her own wand– it was a smile that showed all of her teeth  and no humour at all.
	Hermione bellowed, casting her spell at a Death Eater raising his arm at a muggle family scurrying into a curry shop.
	The first time Hermione had been brought in and discovered that the Order was tacitly permitting torture, she had been enraged.
	Hermione finally shuffled into the dining room with pink cheeks and a bowed head.
	Hermione rose from her seat, agitated.
	"Dammit, show me Hermione."
	Hermione’s hand stilled and she thought deeply about it, searching her heart.
	The memory of the ride on Buckbeak flashed through Hermione's head as she wrapped her arms around Harry.
	Hermione leaned over the aisle again.
	“It’s alright.” Hermione soothed him, stroking his upper arm “This room is much nicer, right?” Harry nodded, though he didn’t feel much better.
	Harry carefully didn't start choking, but it was a near thing when he heard Hermione claim the bloody Dark Lord was going to adopt her.
	Hermione knew how George's tale would end.
	Hermione’s trembling hands smoothed down the silky fabric of the emerald green dress, which hugged her waist perfectly before flaring out into a simple knee length skirt.
	Tiggy is sorry, but until you is being with Miss Hermione, there is nothing Tiggy can be doing.
	“It's just like how he left the mission to gather the Horcruxes to us, Hermione.
	Hermione felt a twinge of guilt and nodded.
	The woman grabbed Hermione and pulled her to her feet; one arm around the younger woman’s waist and the other grabbing Hermione’s hand.
	Hermione promptly dropped back into her seat and looked at him apprehensively.
	Hermione smiled and stepped out of her discarded dress.
	Ravenclaw edged into the lead in the Granger House Cup.
	And Tom offered Hermione something that he couldn't– Harry had always been able to accept Hermione's Darkness, but he couldn't embrace it, not like Tom did.
	Hermione let out a frustrated huff, “I think he’s going to come after me and that’s why I told Harry I can’t be seen around him.
	Hermione moaned low, the sound maddening, and arched her back again.
	"Just for your information, I find Granger to be completely repulsive!"
	Having people like him around her granddaughter would go a long way to assuage her fears of having Hermione return to Hogwarts next year.
	"Would you be so kind as to fetch a book from Miss Granger's dormitory?
	Hermione rolled her eyes and stifled a giggle, "He's teaching himself to read that way.
	Hermione glanced toward Malfoy and noticed that his head was turned just enough to be able to watch her and Theo from the corner of his eye.
	Hermione charmed the fish out of their scales and off of their bones and threw them into a pan.
	The corners of Remus’ mouth lifted in a small smile as he leveled his gaze on Hermione.
	Granger was as standoffish as usual though she seemed to make the occasional effort for Potter's sake.
	Abruptly spinning her around by the wrist, Lucius pushed Hermione back into the bedroom before following her and slamming the door closed.
	Hermione blinked.
	By the time I found out—,” Hermione fell silent for a minute.
	Pansy nodded, also having seen Hermione wince and she felt instant concern.
	Well, most people wouldn’t call it a smile, but in Hermione’s experience it was one of the closest expressions that Snape had to one— he was more of a smirker, really.
	Hermione shook her head.
	Hermione nods.
	And while we were in the Manor,  Snape secured for us a bit of Bellatrix Lestrange’s hair and the key to her Gringotts vault and gave it to Hermione.
	“Rest assured, Mr Longbottom, I will not let anything happen to Miss Granger,” McGonagall said when Neville started inching backward.
	“I’m coming now,” Hermione surveyed the room one last time, then levitated herself across to the space beyond the threshold.
	Hermione sighs.
	"You are losing it, Hermione."
	Hermione removed the charm that kept the leaf in place and spat it in to the vial, grimacing.
	She pulled Hermione into a hug then, rubbing her back.
	Hermione struggles to her feet as Bellatrix becomes lost in the thought.
	He dives for the ground, slamming his head towards the dune, but Hermione catches him by the shoulder and pulls him back.
	The tip of his nose nudged the peak of her nipple, and Hermione thrashed beneath him, overwhelmed by the warm flood caused by that incidental caress.
	They occasionally went out for drinks after work, but Hermione didn't really like to drink, so she just sat with him while he got pissed on Firewhisky.
	"Hermione, you may sit with her if you like, but keep in mind that she needs rest."
	“So I make you forget everything else?” Bellatrix teased her and Hermione blushed.
	Hermione said nothing.
	You are terribly sensitive where Miss Granger is concerned.
	Hermione had a feeling the snake pit was going to be similar in that regard.
	She took a step backward, bumping into Andromeda’s leg, as Fred, George, and Ginny came down the stairs behind Hermione and stopped.` Hermione paled further.
	Hermione was up before most of the rest of the house, though she could hear some puttering in the kitchen that she assumed was Mrs Weasley.
	Hermione rolled her eyes in response and gestured to a seat at the table.
	He pulled Hermione in his arms and without a word walked into the house and up the stairs to her chambers.
	Hermione stared at him in horror.
	She sipped her tea, and stared at Hermione as though she never expected to see her again.
	His blue eyes glanced down at the bite on his fork, then back up at Hermione.
	“Hermione?
	"It's marks out of ten from each one," Hermione told him quietly, and Harry squinted up the field and saw the first judge– Madame Maxime– raise her wand in the air.
	"I've got news for you," he cut in smoothly, letting his gaze settle mockingly on Ginny before flicking his eyes back to Hermione.
	Severus could see Hermione was discomfited by not only performing for a stranger but also being in a unfamiliar place under such stressful circumstances.
	Irving's fiancé, Victoria Rosier, sat with them, as did another wizard that Hermione vaguely recognized.
	"Ah, miss Granger.
	Hermione: [muttering to herself] "As if I'd be expected to have sex with any of those miscreants, honestly."
	I would prefer not to face Pucey in court nor do I wish to place Miss Grangers' job in jeopardy, because you've overstepped your boundaries."
	"Granger," Black paused in front of her, not close enough to be inappropriate, but Hermione could feel tension crackling in the air between them.
	Neither she nor Harry quite knew what to do with the Stone yet– Harry was all for destroying it but Hermione didn't want to, at least not until they figured out why the stone had been moved to Hogwarts in the first place and just who had broken into Gringotts trying to find it.
	"Hermione, Theo said not t-" "And listen," Hermione whispered, "about those things, with the cloaks—?"
	Draco looked back to Hermione and grinned at her as he kicked off the ground.
	If she had been anyone but Hermione Granger, you would have given her a tour and then fucked her brains out against a wall, you know?
	Hermione swallowed with difficulty at the look on Severus’ face before he whirled around and stormed back down the corridor.
	Harry did too, though he felt faintly cheered by Hermione threatening to set people on fire.
	Hermione rolled her eyes.
	Moody immediately demanded and Tonks grinned, her bright green eyes (Hermione was fairly sure they'd been blue earlier) clearly amused.
	Hermione questioned him knowingly, emphasising the word to make a point.
	Hermione smiles at her.
	Hermione said briskly.
	Hermione almost screamed at the comprehension.
	Hermione glanced over her shoulder and watched Draco walk towards his father, his wand dangling from his fingertips.
	“The Malfoys survived,” Hermione began carefully.
	The Healer stepped back to make notes in a chart and Hermione couldn't take it any longer.
	Who were you asking him about Hermione?"
	And a few days before I left —before you and Harry and Ron came, Hermione — he told me there might be something like this."
	Hermione knew all this after the fact as they discussed it.
	Hermione shrugged.
	“But I’m not…,” Hermione trailed off.
	Hermione's heartbeat quickened.
	Moments later, Hermione found herself straddling Bellatrix with her jumper thrown across the room; she was gasping into Bellatrix’s mouth as the older witch ran her nails up her thighs through her tights.
	Which—is probably not really what she’d intended, now that I think about it,” Granger finished, straightening his pile of clothing and fidgeting with the blanket at the foot of the bed.
	With the fountain pen Hermione had bought him for his birthday, Draco signed the agreement, the Y of his name looping over to glide across the D. His solicitors gathered their briefcases, portfolios, notepads, and quills, and exited the study.
	Next to Hermione, a kneazle, the image of Crookshanks, has appeared and she immediately sweeps it up and into her arms.
	His thrusts were harsh, as they almost always were, but Hermione got sweet and tender from Patience and Abraxas.
	Hermione felt her mouth tighten.
	She would hardly chastise her here when it was just the four of them, Hermione was a nurturing soul and she secretly loved her carefree attitude in these moments.
	Hermione wondered whether the soul containers had to be inanimate or if they could potentially be living vessels, considering Voldemort’s strange attachment to his snake Nagini.
	Only a few moments later, he saw Hermione and Abraxas emerge from the edge of the forest, their hands brushing one another as they walked closely together.
	Neville gave him two thumbs up; Hermione was clapping hard enough to hurt her hands, and Ron…still looked less than chuffed.
	Hermione was no innocent child; she was a survivor, a serpent with porcelain skin covering her sharpened steel, and he was fiercely, protectively proud of her.
	Not with Hermione by his side.
	Hermione winced as the cat sunk his claws into her to keep from falling before rearranging him so he was draped over her shoulders.
	Patience’s form was nearly an exact opposite of Hermione’s.
	It was OK that the boys were good fliers and into Quidditch because it was physical and sports and not Hermione's thing.
	Hermione asked cautiously.
	Hermione thought of what Pansy had told her.
	Hermione laughs, as if he’s made a joke, and walks off with Ron.
	When Hermione had thrown herself backward, knocking Bellatrix Lestrange off balance, Snape had been poised behind her, and the confusion had given him the chance to seize the necklace and a lock of Bellatrix’s hair.
	"I want you, Hermione.
	Nudging Hermione’s lips apart, just slightly.
	Hermione asked.
	Bellatrix looked up and caught Hermione's eyes, who gestured outside.
	“Hermione and I channeled our joined magic through our hands and she said the spell,” Tom jumped in.
	Hermione looked over at the other two women and offered them a small smile with a nod, “I’ll be there in a moment.
	What does Hermione even want to get out of this?
	A leg shifted upwards between her own and Hermione yelped, trying to nudge the offending appendage away.
	Hermione nods, still tearful.
	Hermione looks up, groaning again.
	Hermione rolled her lower body, meeting each snap of his hips with her own thrust.
	Hermione welcomed his tongue with a moan of her own, and she clung to him as he caged her in with his body.
	Hermione kept shaking his hand up and down as her brain short-circuited slightly.
	The older woman gaped as Hermione grinned triumphantly, closing the door in her face.
	"Please what, Miss Granger?"
	Hermione snatches the paper back.
	Hermione and Percy exclaimed, scandalized, simultaneously.
	The knife moves to Hermione’s arm… Some of you…may know the word that was cut into Hermione’s arm.
	"Well, I'm…" Hermione faltered.
	It was my wife that approached Hermione, not the other way around.
	The creature pounced and Hermione barely had time to cast the spell; fangs inches from her face it suddenly shot backwards, tumbling over itself across the forest floor.
	Hermione smashed it open with her palm and scanned the message.
	Hermione, for her part, was panting heavily and needed a moment to catch her breath.
	Drunk Hermione felt a ping of sadness at the mention of the awful people who would end up raising her best friend, but the alcohol she had consumed chased it away.
	At least he and Hermione had the DA, who had been informed of the situation on the first night and had since cooperated in getting detentions to help with homework and also some evocative screaming to imitate being tortured.
	"Please enjoy your dessert, miss Granger."
	Hermione said with wonder.
	“Five points for your cheek, Miss Granger,” Snape snaps after them, already sweeping off down the stairs to the dungeons.
	Hermione recognised a bottle of firewhiskey which was open and half full.
	"Miss Granger," Dumbledore raises his voice — enough to command attention.
	Vinda cupped her cheek and kissed her forehead and ran her fingers through Hermione’s curls.
	"I'm Hermione Granger," she said desperately, struggling to remember.
	Hermione pulled away from the door, suddenly feeling guilty for eavesdropping.
	To the point, Hermione could see every penis and set of testicles in the room in exquisite detail, glowing like beacons.
	“So why didn’t you stop me?” Hermione asked.
	And Hermione was completely at her mercy, she needed Ginny to let Harry fuck her.
	She came with her blood in Hermione's mouth.
	The next morning, Hermione made a few inroads on the archive schedule she'd been putting off.
	Hermione fiddles with her wand and looks at the floor.
	She walked towards one of the walls that had a few family pictures—Picking Hermione up at Kings Cross her first year, their vacation to France in her third, the most recent a skiing picture before she disappeared last Christmas—her teacher looked at them and smiled warmly, "Well, somethings have changed, but not many."
	Hermione laughed softly.
	Hermione, after you’ve finished eating, I’ll be expecting you in my office.” “Yes, sir,” Hermione agreed, jaw stiff, before turning to give Harry’s hand a squeeze.
	Hermione turns and frowns at Harry.
	Hermione stopped walking as she realised what he was doing.
	Most of it had been Hermione's idea: Use Theo as the bait to prompt Daphne (the guiltier party, in Hermione's conditionally-professional opinion) to drastic action, fake his death, pass his money off to Draco and neatly solve all her problems before disappearing forever.
	He thrust several more times, grunting as he did so until “…YES!” The cry came not from Harry, or even Ginny, but from Hermione, as Harry began to unload himself straight down Demelza’s throat.
	When she had time or when she was studying away from the other Slytherins, usually during Harry's Quidditch practices, Hermione would always ask if he wished to come out– which he always took care not to sound too eager about agreeing to– and they'd discuss and debate magical theory for hours, would trade knowledge on spells and potions that they'd picked up and sometimes they'd just read in each other's company.
	“You do not fall short, Hermione.
	Hermione's arms crossed protectively around her waist.
	"I'm sorry," replied Hermione again.
	Viktor shook hands with all the boys and kissed Hermione's knuckles which made her blush furiously.
	Hermione dove to avoid a cruciatus streaking down the hallway.
	Harry shook his head and Hermione muffled an "I told you so."
	“To be clear, Granger, are you asking me out?
	To the zipper on Hermione’s trousers.
	Hermione pushed hard against the snow and flung herself forward, running as fast as she could, the wind whipping her hair about.
	Hermione gave him an annoyed expression.
	At this, Lucius leaned in closer and closer, until Hermione saw his eyes flick down to her lips, and she realized what he intended to do.
	Hermione followed Zipper, leaving more beacons along her path and was surprised to find a house deeper in.
	Hermione was petting the kittens, though she was watching Tom.
	“Funny how you demand freedom for yourself when what you secretly want from me is subservience, compliance to the rules of the universe as written by Hermione Bonneau, oh, I’m sorry, Granger,” he sneered.
	“Not really,” Hermione protested with a shake of her head.
	Then grabs Hermione’s jaw.
	When Hermione had to call Snape to save her.
	Ginny and Hermione shared a look.
	Hermione looked at him in confusion.
	Hermione tilted her head impatiently.
	It was true – Hermione Granger had bewitched him.
	Harry repeated, wondering if he should revisit his earlier theory that Hermione really had lost her mind.
	Hermione bit her lip, Pansy's hand tight in hers, as Draco and Harry both shot down after the falling players, their brooms nearly vertical as they took simultaneous dives.
	The older girl's eyes seemed to sharpen as they surveyed her and Hermione held herself stiff under the close examination.
	"Granger—" Hermione's lips tried to form words.
	“Its not over yet.” Hermione temporized, even though she too was smiling, the celebration was infection.
	All Hermione could do was run.
	"Nev, Granger is beating everyone in the rankings — least that's what I heard from one of the claws."
	"I wouldn't expect less from Hermione Granger," a familiar voice said from behind.
	It didn't help, either, that Hermione was realizing Snape apparently had a "type."
	“Granger, I’ve—I’ve killed children before.
	A soft cough came from the opposite side of the firepit and Draco looked sideways without releasing Hermione.
	"Seriously, I do hope it works out," smiled Hermione.
	Puts him back under her skirt somewhere, winking at Hermione.
	“Shall we?” Hermione asked as she looked over at her grandmother.
	Hermione smiled, craning her neck to look out of the window.
	Why don’t you want people to know that Granger is a-” Kia was quick to stop him from speaking further.
	Emma Granger thew open the main doors to the van at the back.
	"Oh, Hermione," Her mother breathed as she watched Hermione pass the child to Healer Browne to be cleaned and swaddled.
	Hermione snorts.
	Well, other than Neville and Hermione, who had given him a fifteen-minute lecture on the subject) this time.
	“He really does,” Hermione agreed.
	Hermione Disillusioned herself, crossed out of the circle of her enchantments, and took five large steps forward.
	Sirius and Rodolphus disrobed down to their boxers and Hermione undressed and slipped on an old shirt she'd stolen many years ago.
	Hermione hopped off his lap and ran inside to find her screaming friend.
	Hermione tried to shield herself, but the impact of the first blow from the poker smashed a bone in her forearm.
	Hermione could understand why he'd wanted to place those two where he could have kept a closer eye on them.
	Her fingers, her hands her lips her hair her face her body—Granger, whom he'd secretly wondered about for years, hating himself through every second it—only not Granger at all—Granger, except eleven hundred times more tempting—awful and insane and fucking irresistible— not-Granger—NOT Granger, he adamantly reminded himself—offered demurely, leaning back to meet his gaze with her fucking golden brown eyes, her absolute vision of innocence that was now somehow veiled with an oppressively coquettish charm, an undeniably sexy disregard for rules or consequences or anything, it seemed, aside from wrapping him around her fucking beautiful finger.
	It forced itself past her blood-stained lips and into her flower-riddled mouth, pushing itself down her throat; Hermione gagged and tried to pull it away, but its body was too slick, too powerful— Hermione awoke with a violent start.
	Clearing her throat, Hermione blinks and urges herself to think like a scholar — not a nervous wreck.
	asked Hermione.
	Hermione fell asleep quickly, as soon as her head hit the pillow and her dreams were filled with Bellatrix.
	Sighing in exasperation Hermione said, “If I untie you, do you promise not to attack Bella or Roddy again?
	"Right, him," Hermione agreed absently.
	He was also curious to why Hermione was fascinated with doing a test run of the Defense Helmets tonight.
	"Come on, Hermione, before Mum starts screaming again."
	Hermione’s eyes darted around the room, nervously, then met her husband’s cold gaze.
	“But don’t you want to know how I—” Hermione began only to be silenced by another hungry, greedy kiss.
	She led her away from the table and Hermione melted into her arms like she belonged there which, now, she did.
	So Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the little shop together.
	The memories Mia had shared with Remus told them that, at the very least, he, Tonks, Harry, Hermione, and Remus would make it through this, and the war would be over in less than two years.
	The nervous mind healer came frequently with Healer Stroud to examine Hermione’s brain and psychological condition.
	Hermione pouted.
	Hermione set her cup down on the vanity and began to remove her make-up with a charmed cloth while she thought about the most major of concerns: Last night.
	Hermione knew what she had to do now.
	Hermione's eyes are bright with curiosity.
	She attempted to cast a quick Cruciatus but the warm, golden pod surrounding Hermione and Snape shielded them, her Unforgivable Curse’s power completely absorbed and dissipated by the magical energy of the Marriage Spell.
	And Hermione was holding together by the skin of her teeth.
	Smoothing his hands over his robes, Severus made eye contact with Charity over the top of Hermione's head.
	Hermione startled violently then shot him a small glare.
	Taking Hermione's wrist he held down on it.
	Hermione shakes her head and bites down on her lip to keep herself from crying.
	The snitch flew off, and Hermione let out a shaky breath as she stared down in amazement at where Harry was touching her.
	Bellatrix warded off most of Hermione’s frantic flailing, but she couldn’t dodge all of the girls’ hits.
	Hermione took a shuddering breath and slapped both palms to her forehead, pressing her eyes together and banishing the images.
	Why not?” Hermione asked.
	Hermione smiles and claps with everyone else as her mind whirs.
	Hermione closed her eyes and took a deep breath.
	Hermione did check her map and was seemingly pleased to see a red dot appear on it.
	"Hermione?"
	Hermione: [Swallows and looks terrified.]
	Hermione bit her lip and looked over at the bed where Tom was laying.
	Blood is thicker than water, Hermione, and pure-bloods know this better than most."
	Draco had come up with a new political slogan for his inevitable run for Minister against Hermione.
	So why did he have to take Hermione?
	Hermione frowned.
	Hermione bit her lip.
	A rush of running feet, and Hermione bolted out in front of them, sprinting to the front gates.
	Within three days of attacking Hermione, Phineas Borgin was thoroughly thrashed down to the bottommost rung of the Alpha hierarchy.
	Think, Hermione.
	Hermione bit her lip, but did nod her head.
	Hermione: "What's this tree, Malfoy?"
	Hermione is happy to stay out of this until Ginny says, "she's damn slight nicer than Phlegm," and Hermione snaps.
	Hermione frowned at her and headed out the door.
	He suspected if the link he'd created between Tom and the girl, Hermione Granger, had not existed, Tom would not have been able to resist the reintegration long enough for the spell to be cut off.
	She—or well, Hermione—would have likely blushed furiously, nervously asking Luna questions to try and suss out whether or not her friend was being pressured by pureblood customs, archaic laws, and a potentially deviant fiancé.
	Hermione could barely adjust to the sensation.
	Hermione’s smile fell.
	As they all heaved for breath afterwards, Harry more out of shock then exertion, Hermione grabbed him by the collar, pulling him forwards into a lazy kiss.
	Hermione and her friends prepare for the ball.
	Hermione gave her a suspicious look.
	This caused the young witch to gape at Bellatrix, who was again pensively working on the plot of her story: Trix had solved a problem in a half a minute which had stumped Hermione for days in her sixth year and she hadn't even been trying!
	“Right,” Hermione said, pulling off the cloak.
	Hermione was both impressed and fearful of how skillfully the woman guided the beast beneath their feet.
	Dumbledore was responsible for hurting Hermione.
	Hermione pushed her food around her plate, biting back all the things she wanted to say about the Malfoys, and how none of them would be sitting there if it weren't for them.
	Ron, Ginny, Harry and Hermione ran into the back of them.
	Hermione flushed and looked down at her lap.
	Hermione breathed in a voice that was actually terrifyingly calm but he could see the whites of her eyes.
	Draco pulled her down the corridor, and Hermione whipped over her shoulder to watch Cho yank the sword from Mulciber's body with her heeled foot as leverage, before swinging heavily and lodging the old sword into his neck with a scream.
	Distantly Hermione was concerned that the lies were coming easier for her.
	Nott’s reaction to realizing that Hermione and Malfoy had resumed shagging was one of the more subtle ones.
	“Bel-ah!” Hermione fingers scratched against Bellatrix’s scalp as she arched; pulling her curls.
	A low rumble, and Hermione watched in horror as a chest of drawers flew at him, pinning him to a nearby shelf.
	They had discussed all of this at length, but now was the time to tell Hermione.
	Hermione covered her face — she could feel it burning beet red through her fingertips.
	As the door closed, Hermione thought of chasing her friend down and demanding answers- consequences be damned.
	The Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws all hated me after my name came out of the Goblet, but I had my real friends at my side and you've got your friends here for you too– I'm here for you, Hagrid, and so's Hermione and- and so's Professor Dumbledore."
	He seemed quieter, and Hermione found him much more thoughtful during their lunchtime chats.
	But even with all that concern for Hermione gnawing at his stomach, he couldn’t help but be impressed by Draco’s gambit.
	Hermione began fighting against her invisible bindings as blood rushed through her ears, knowing it was useless— She stepped around Hermione as flames soared overhead.
	"I couldn't see Granger picking out those dress robes."
	“You look very pretty in red.” Slightly off-kilter from the compliment— or threat, Hermione wasn’t quite sure— her emotions were spinning between wary, winded, panicked and murderously angry.
	"We'll have to figure out whether or not it's worth getting even more involved in this situation," Hermione said, frustrated, "Do you know how much trouble we could get in if it comes out that we're aware of an illegal dragon—" He and Hermione quietly debated what to do all through their class, Hermione leaning more towards letting Hagrid figure his own way out of the mess and Harry wanting to protect him– Hagrid, after all, had been the one to buy him his first birthday present.
	“Oh, just the usual pitch of why I should leave you for him,” Hermione tossed off, sarcastically.
	“I’m going to fucking make you regret this!” Hermione spat, dumping the last of her books back in her satchel, Daphne having repaired it for her, fixing them both with a venomous look.
	Hermione's broom skidded to a stop, flinging her over the handle and with a thump on the stone ground of the corridor, promptly knocking the breath out of her—the sword of Gryffindor clanking against the floor as she fell.
	“Oh,” Harry said, grabbing this lifeline, “Ah, sorry Hermione.
	Hermione was scratching at her mudblood scar; something she had only seen the girl do when she had awoken from a nightmare about the one who had gave it to her in the first place.
	"I'm sorry," Hermione cuts in.
	Hermione froze.
	The next period was time for Advanced Herbology where professor Sprout had allowed Hermione and Bellatrix to work on a project of their own.
	Hesitantly, Hermione faced him, but Severus was done with both her diffidence and his own; in a split second he’d grabbed her by the waist and set her on the padded top.
	"Not after..." he shuddered slightly and Hermione's face softened.
	Hermione checked the time when she arrived back at her Head Girl suite.
	Hermione took off at a run.
	Hermione chanced a glance up and caught the eyes of another Lot before the girl looked down shamefully, as if Hermione had just discovered her own secret.
	He agreed, but never let go of Hermione’s hand.
	Granger, go with him."
	"Well, that is a point of view, certainly, but you may recall that Lord Slytherin did grant vassalage to what is now the House of Granger.
	“Am I…allowed to tell you that you’re beautiful?” Hermione asks quietly, eyes drifting over Fleur.
	Hermione talks for what feels like hours, and probably is.
	Especially not by Hermione.
	Hermione tries to laugh, but it hurts her chest.
	Hermione and Luna made an odd friendship but they were solidly progressing in that direction.
	Hermione who probably now knew Bellatrix better than anyone else.
	He knew Hermione had no issues with torture and murder when it came to acts of revenge, and although Harry may hate killing he had certainly proven to be capable of it, however Tom wanted to see just how it was they reacted when it wasn't a near-stranger they were faced with, but rather someone who was their age and they saw nearly every day.
	Four outlines appeared in his mind, Him, Hermione, and Daphne, and a fourth off to his side.
	Hermione hissed.
	Staring at Hermione.
	“If there’s anything I can do to help, Hermione, just say the word.
	As Fred regained his footing, Hermione snuck one of the pillows and hid in the shadows of the adjoining bathroom.
	Blaise took another sip of his wine, his eyes casually flicking over to where Ginny stood talking to Granger, having a similar secret female conversation.
	So different from what he was used to, Hermione thought.
	Hermione looked to be interested until Molly Weasley's voice boomed from below, echoing inside the walls: "Ginny!
	Hermione’s grin lit with triumph, and she nudged Snape’s hand with her knee to make sure he’d noted her cleverness.
	Hermione jerked it again and Bellatrix’s fist opened, her wand slipping from her grasp.
	Hermione tugged down his underwear, and his prick leapt out to greet her with all the subtlety of a Labrador puppy, drooling in her face and demanding to be petted.
	"The scar, for one thing, and her - " he gestures to Hermione, "general air of sorcery - " "General air of - " Hermione breaks off, staring.
	Hermione wanted to slap herself for noticing.
	This is you, Hermione.
	"I do," said Hermione.
	Hermione blinked.
	Hermione had been somewhat lucky.
	Tom murmured, running the tips of his long, slender fingers over the raised scar tissue and Hermione couldn't help but shiver slightly.
	Viktor Krum looked exactly like the figure Hermione had bought– he was thin, dark, and sallow-skinned, with a large curved nose and thick black eyebrows.
	Hermione glanced around and, finding there was no one else in the store, gave him a knowing smirk before throwing her arms around him.
	Hermione looked from where Aiden’s fingers touched her bare skin up to Draco, to find him looking at her wrist too.
	"Up," she ordered, and Hermione groaned as Bill stopped eating her out.
	Hermione’s heart was beating fast.
	Hermione picked the glass up and eyed it suspiciously.
	"Actually," Lucius said with a frown, "it has nothing to do with Hermione– or Harry.
	When Hermione and Ron weren’t in the process of training a paramilitary force of grateful, slightly mad, and increasingly dangerous wizards and witches, they camped out by Harry’s bedside for the first couple days.
	Ginny and Harry had been together and Hermione had no memory of it.
	I never knew Hermione Granger.
	Hermione felt a momentary pang of alarm as the two of them traded jinxes, until Charity failed to block one and Snape paused to cancel the jinx and demonstrate what she'd done wrong.
	Harry was drawn for their conversation by Hermione, who’d begun ripping his shirt open.
	“Does it always feel like this?” Hermione murmured, shifting so that she could look at Bellatrix, who was watching her tenderly.
	"Miss Granger will not be able to finish her lesson today."
	And now Hermione is too hot.
	"Long-suffering and having the patience of a saint," Hermione chuckled.
	"I'm so sorry, Narcissa," Hermione said, words pouring out of her.
	Sirius heard Hermione gasp at the same time that he felt the air chill down his throat.
	Hermione nodded and followed him to the section of the family wing, which housed Malfoy's personal rooms.
	Lucius reached out to clasp her arm, but Hermione turned her shoulders slightly so he’d bump into her breast.
	Hermione interrupted, a quiet rage bubbling vile within her, "Their relationship is based on her going to wish him Good Luck at Quidditich tryouts, how thick can he get—?"
	Hermione flipped through the object she knew to be a horcrux with some mixture of reverence and wariness.
	Hermione made a tutting noise.
	Hermione: "'Bad memories'?
	Hermione looks out the compartment window and sees Fred, George, and Mr. Weasley standing next to the barrier examining it cautiously.
	Hermione can finally breathe again as the magical eye darts from her and continues scanning the room, spinning in all directions.
	When Monsieur DuBois stopped speaking, and no soup was set before her, Hermione looked up at the person shading her from the sun, and her blood ran cold to see Draco, jaw tight, but smiling down at Monsieur DuBois.
	By all means, Miss Granger.
	Hermione, perhaps foolishly, didn’t hesitate.
	"Like you," not-Granger said, frowning.
	Hermione cried out in surprise, trying to scurry away.
	Hermione watched him for a moment.
	Two days later, Hermione found herself entering the lift in the Ministry Atrium and descending to Level 9.
	It'd been Malfoy who distracted Harry from the stress of worrying about Ron and Hermione.
	"My, that sounds vengeful," Daphne noted, surprised, and Hermione stopped short, seeming to have only just realized she'd said it out loud.
	Hermione raised an eyebrow.
	When she woke to the sound of Tom’s screams reverberating in her skull, Hermione was out of her bed, wand in hand, and running down the stairs, out of Ravenclaw Tower before any conscious thought had passed.
	Hermione sent everyone except Tom to the portkey site.
	Hermione exhales in relief.
	Granger– we're in my quarters.
	Hermione felt the tips of her ears grow warm and ducked her head down.
	Hermione smiled and nodded.
	Hermione replayed everything she could recall from the night.
	Hermione nodded stiffly.
	Bellatrix pranced in place, eager to find Hermione but reluctant to leave Crookshanks.
	I just mean— well it isn’t appropriate for— she’s an adult witch, and she has shown interest in— in— it’s nothing personal, Hermione.
	Hermione is so fed up with secrets!
	“Snatchers,” said Hermione.
	Hermione masked her scowl with a venomous smile.
	“Well then.” Bellatrix leaned back, and Hermione missed the touch of her hand immediately.
	Hermione could never forgot the horror of Katie Bell’s silent scream when she had touched the cursed necklace in their sixth year, or the look of Dumbledore’s blackened, withered hand.
	Hermione’s twenty-second birthday snuck up on her, taking her by surprise.
	Harry, Ron and Hermione followed, but it was frustrating to move so slowly.
	James was cut off by Sirius clamping his hand over the other boy's mouth and giving Hermione a shrug.
	The words blurred, the ink smudging as Hermione's tears spilled onto the parchment.
	Hermione tipped her head back, staring at the ceiling with a mounting disquiet as she thought of the screams she'd heard outside, the ones she'd first ascribed to the peacocks roaming the Manor grounds.
	By the end of the day, each woman knew that Hermione was still a virgin and that she had some experiences so far with her wizards, which they didn’t seem fussed about, they half expected it.
	Hermione's fingers stroked through his hair, her hands only trembling slightly as she sucked in deep breaths.
	A tray full of champagne glasses hovered past them, and Hepzibah deftly grabbed two of them and handed one to Hermione.
	Hermione rose her hand—an old habit—before just blurting it out.
	As they walked down her street towards the Apparition point, Hermione suddenly was seized with panic.
	Theo: "Right, okay, so rule number one, be careful with Granger."
	"I'm meeting with the delegates of the French champion's activist group to discuss the terms of an alliance later," Voldemort told them and Harry straightened up in his seat, shoving his confused thoughts off to a corner of his mind as Hermione's eyes sharpened with interest.
	::There is no enemy:: Hermione hissed back.
	“I’d think up something clever to say here, but you’re honestly not worth the effort,” Hermione drawled disdainfully, twisting her mouth into a sneer as she let her acacia wand slip from her sleeve, down into her hand.
	"I never thought I'd see the day where Hermione didn't give her hundred percent in a class."
	Lucius wondered if Granger’s pussy worked with similar magic.
	"Come on, we need to find Neville," Hermione muttered as they left Lucius's study nearly an hour later.
	I…I just want to leave from here.” Hermione told the witch.
	Hermione narrowed her eyes at Molly for a moment before looking back at Minerva.
	A loud gasp burst from Hermione’s lips as the sting from the paddle surprised her.
	"Though this had better be good, Granger."
	Instead of allowing him to lead her over to his house, Hermione laughed and stayed put.
	Hermione huffs, and spins on her heel to march out of the room.
	Hermione shook her head.
	Hermione searched his face, seeing the disappointment in his eyes.
	Hermione had heard the same message before when she was summoned to Dumbledore's office, when she first started having dreams of Ron and Fred's deaths.
	“No, sir,” Hermione says, and turns to Harry with a triumphant look, as if to say: See?
	Going to work with Granger in Justice?”  He keeps his head down for the rest of the day, not ready to say anything to anyone, and when he gets home he remembers that it’s Wednesday, and Ron, Hermione and Rose are coming for dinner.
	Onyx eyes followed the movement and Hermione saw them darken.
	Hermione paused puzzled.
	Hermione laid it on the flat of her palm and held it up.
	"I thought you didn't know your parents, Granger?"
	He didn't know that Hermione had forced a gift on him.
	“Where are you going?” Hermione asked in a small voice, obviously hurt by his refusal.
	Hermione could only watch on in terror and anxiety as her friends struggled to keep up with them, their brooms and limbs flailing about in every direction in an effort to stay in the air and on their tail.
	Granger is though — maybe Weasley too — Draco hears her voice calling him, but he can't hear it over his own guttural sounds of agony.
	He glanced surreptitiously at Granger who suddenly looked guilty.
	Hermione rushed to reassure them.
	Hermione pushed her chin up.
	And then Severus thought of the clever, cunning French champion with her sharp smiles and friendship with Hermione and realised exactly how the veela had gotten involved.
	“Draco, dear,” Narcissa said, “I invited Hermione to tea today.
	“Oh, pet, you really are playing with fire…” A spark hit Hermione in the ass and she jumped, rubbing it.
	The woman's eyes were dark as her tone and Hermione nodded urgently.
	Hermione said, without even looking in the other girl's direction.
	Maybe he was just worried she'd stop being his friend, Harry mused, which was silly because Hermione wouldn't drop him for a boyfriend any more than he would drop her if he got a girlfriend.
	In and out of consciousness, Hermione had no idea if it was thirty seconds or thirty minutes later, but her brain was brought back into the current moment by a loud banging noise, and a wail of shrill, piercing klaxons in the near-distance.
	She felt a wisp of cool air between her thighs, and the woman stood up and began waving her wand in intricate circles over Hermione's now empty, but still protruding belly.
	Hermione could be deaf, blind, and dumb, yet Bellatrix would still find some reason to attack her.
	“You have done six NEWTs, Hermione, in such a short period of time.
	And then there’s a splash as someone dives into the water from high above, launching back out to sit next to Hermione on the platform.
	Out on the grounds, Hermione wrapped her cloak more tightly around herself and aimed her steps towards the memorial.
	Hermione: [smiling vacantly] "He'll be back.
	Hermione felt the pounding in her ears again.
	Hagrid told us that something was going on in the forest,” Hermione replied calmly, hoping that she could talk Ginny down enough for them to find somewhere less public to have this discussion.
	Speaking of pricks… Before she could stop herself, Hermione’s attention had snapped down to Snape’s waist.
	It looks familiar, but it isn't something that Hermione can place, so she calls it new.
	“Point of n-no return,” Hermione translated quickly—though her Latin skills did little to illuminate her.
	Hermione pointed to a gathering of tins.
	This evening, without his precautions, Miss Granger would have died.
	Hermione peeked down the hall, seeing a large, ornate door at the end of it.
	The magical world had their own traditions, ideals, culture and laws; turning the Ministry of Magic into a copy of the muggle world wouldn’t work, magic made witches and wizards different to muggles and the magical government was necessarily different because of that— once muggleborns understood that, once they’d adapted to the magical world and a balance had been found between introducing new ideas and concepts without destroying old traditions and culture to do so, Hermione had no doubt muggleborns could flourish in the magical government.
	Hermione’s neck craned to look around the room for an exit and was trying her damndest not to notice anything about the private sanctuary of Professor Snape.
	Hermione wasn't someone who took stock in urban legends and ghost stories, but suddenly found herself rather jumpy.
	I’m Hermione Jean Rosier  Grindelwald.
	"We have already welcomed Harry and Hermione into our home and our family, alongside recognising Harry's maternal line as a cadet branch," Charlus says.
	Hermione told her how quickly it all shifted downhill.
	"All is normal, and the fertility enchantments in your ring have been confirmed to be in perfect working order," the healer spoke, and Hermione let out a small sigh of relief.
	But then he'd had Hermione spend days analyzing why after he completed the transformation, so maybe that was why.
	Hermione picked up her coffee cup, about to take a sip when Harry reappeared, frowning at the floor, arms crossed.
	“Hermione!” Susan whispered loudly “What are you doing!” The magic the Hermione felt from behind that door felt deeply, transcendentally familiar.
	A toss of floo powder and a whispered destination left Hermione staring into the empty fireplace.
	Under her critical gaze, Hermione felt flushed.
	Hermione doesn’t do that.
	Anxiety built between all of them as they rounded up the boys and Hermione led them through the Malfoy’s Floo to her home.
	Hermione rolled up onto her toes to give him one more kiss.
	"Oh, really, it's fine," Hermione said, clutching her trunk tighter when Sirius tried to take it.
	Hermione cautiously lowers her hands.
	“Your friends are boisterous,” Hermione’s mum laughed.
	Though it was still early, Harry stumbled into the kitchen, rousing Hermione from her thousand-yard stare.
	“No, obviously I wouldn’t,” Hermione nudged her, chuckling.
	He stifled a grin and bent his head as Hermione walked up to him.
	Hermione grinned and, without even looking down, ripped open his belt in record time.
	“…Hermione may have poisoned Umbridge and I may need help making sure the antidote doesn’t kill her.
	Hermione dropped her head into her hands for several seconds.
	"Hermione."
	Think, Miss Granger!” He reigned in his temper but the scowl adorning his face failed to lessen.
	The boys brushed themselves off as Hermione grabbed her hand towel and wiped the sweat from her face, neck, and arms.
	Hermione: [sighs] "Marry McGonagall, make love to Pince, kill Hooch."
	Padma, again smiled and laid a comforting hand over top of Hermione's.
	"Can't say I have," Hermione frowns.
	And that finally wakes Hermione up.
	Bellatrix nods, curls brushing Hermione’s face.
	Hagrid yells, and Hermione has to fight against the urge to go look for her friend's body that might be getting pummeled under all of the retreating bodies.
	A lot to a point that Hermione fell to her knees and fought to keep herself awake.
	It…might be time for you to contact the Order now, Granger.
	They were in a small storage room and Hermione felt her nerves increase at the close proximity of the older witch when she turned around.
	“We already know,” Hermione says.
	Hermione's heart sank because she had known on some level that Ron had been thinking that and she just wasn't doing it.
	“Does…was that…does Bellatrix really like me?” Hermione whispers cautiously.
	The Chesterfield twins, Violet and Marigold, made immediately for the chairs at the front of the room and sat down patiently waiting for Hermione to start, followed shortly thereafter by Annabel Entwhistle, Colin Creevey, and Alan Gage.
	Overwhelmed by the gravity of Harry’s words, Hermione cracked, all the air rushing from her body as if she’d been punched in the chest.
	Although she was determined to wind her up and train, Hermione remembered their conversation from earlier in the week as though it were that morning.
	Once a month Hermione would show up on the previously agreed upon date and let him fuck her.
	Hermione had told him that too.
	Ron and Hermione exchange a grim look that Harry doesn’t like one bit.
	Hermione: "I'm sorry, is this still the spider murdering us in this scenario, or is this actually about Voldemort?"
	"Come on Hermione, am I that poor a conversationalist?"
	And Hermione had actually looked... well, not quite afraid, but what was likely one of the closest things to it the girl would allow to show.
	And it had worked thanks in part to Hermione's inclusion in his lessons and her sponsorship under the House of Black.
	Hermione turned to Fred.
	“Hermione, what are your plans after you graduate?” Hermione’s heart beat increased, she shifted and looked away.
	"Granger."
	Hermione gripped the stem of her champagne glass as they walked past tables set with elegant tablecloths and lavish centerpieces, the silver glittering in the light of the candelabras.
	"I think Severus will be big," Hermione commented.
	Lily had, as Hermione had described, bravely protected her son to the end.
	Bella had conceded reluctantly, but as soon as Hermione had arrived back home she was underfoot, insisting she take care of Mia.
	My dearest Hermione, Hermione sighed as she read the letter.
	If Hermione’s brain had short circuited when Bellatrix was kissing her, it was nothing compared to now.
	Hermione had been looking at Tom Riddle all wrong.
	"Thank you, Lucius," Hermione whispered with a soft smile.
	Hermione quickly dropped the wand on the table, her heart pounding wildly again.
	You can do it, Hermione.
	It is commonly used to describe the state of a person post-orgasm,” she paused, breathing out softly and causing all the little hairs of Hermione’s body to rise as the sensation caressed her ear, “when you experience that delicious moment between conscious and unconscious; on the edge of a dream.” Hermione was biting her lip so hard that she thought she might taste blood.
	Hermione’s heart racing until the blood roared in her ears, but she squared her shoulders and forced herself to walk towards her bed.
	Harry wished, abruptly, that he and Ron and Hermione had joined the Order in due time, formally, the way Fred and George had.
	Then you vanished for a week and walked into the Great Hall as—“ he had the sense not to say the word aloud in a classroom and merely eyed Hermione, “—and it ruined my elaborate plan to finally introduce myself because suddenly everyone was doing it.”  “We’re not—we aren’t dating,” Hermione clarified hurriedly.
	Hermione stood up and looked at him.
	It wasn't until they passed the fires that Hermione recognized the smell.
	At times like these, Hermione wondered why she even bothered with pretty undergarments when her mate never took the time to appreciate them.
	He settles back in his chair, and before Harry can argue, a Mediwitch, Hermione and Ron walk through the door.
	Hermione gave a gasping laugh of relief as he nipped her ear.
	In the main hall, he looked from face to face, putting every guest into his mind, moving slowly to see if anyone paid extra attention to him and Hermione as he took her up to the open-play floor.
	Hermione did a double take.
	“I don’t suppose we could just send him to therapy, could we?” Lupin fixed her with a rueful look, and Hermione sighed.
	Hermione started to understand.
	As they settled on the broom, Hermione immediately understood why Harry and Demelza’s broom rides had been such a big deal.
	Hermione perched on an ottoman and opened it.
	Hermione realized she had to do something.
	Lucius scowled in response, and Hermione giggled as she caught the ghost of another smirk pass over Severus' features.
	Hermione: [puts her fork down, resting her chin on the heel of her hand.]
	Raises her wand at Hermione.
	Had he and Hermione never become friends, the brunette would’ve never hunted the horcruxes with him and hence, would have never ran into Bellatrix in the first place.
	Hermione existed in Malfoy’s mind in a similar manner.
	Hermione brought the end of her Butterbeer to her lips.
	Hermione has no idea what will happen tomorrow.
	Hermione smirked at him, curling a finger as she leaned back on one palm.
	"I've learnt all our set books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough – I'm Hermione Granger by the way, who are you?"
	Hermione stared at the scene, only ever having heard a house-elf speak like that before when Sirius and Kreacher were in a row; those never ended well.
	Hermione woke to a sudden shaking grasp on her right shoulder.
	On the outskirts of the forbidden forest, they'd set up fidelius charm after fidelius charm, always with Daphne as the secret keeper, continually experimenting with how Harry and Hermione reacted to different instructions, both inside and outside the charms.
	Between her own siren abilities, the stress and pain she’s constantly under, and just her hormones in general; Hermione was constantly a mess of emotions at all times.
	Harry instantly opened his mouth to protest, having heard more then enough from the other Slytherins to know what a sketchy place it was, but Hermione firmly spoke first.
	“Best friends in general, I think,” Hermione admitted, before pausing slightly.
	“‘We’ll always have Paris’*,” Hermione quoted, smiling when both Harry and Tom just looked confused.
	Over the years, Patience had become a part of Hermione’s life that was automatic.
	Hermione bit her lip, and stared at the wall of her room that used to be the Wall.
	Hermione’s dark eyes whirled, searching him out.
	Mott turned and looked over at the pair of dueling Snapes, then back to Hermione.
	Hermione pulls it out.
	Hermione’s hair was so wet it had almost gone flat.
	Hermione turned away.
	Hermione sighs.
	Hermione skids to a stop before she can bump into the pair.
	Despite Hermione’s philosophical opposition to co-sleeping, Aurore slept in the middle of the bed between Draco and Hermione.
	“They were fine,” Hermione said, looking up at him and trying to will herself into perking up.
	“If you say so, Granger.
	Since she met Hermione.
	Hermione shook her head, not brave enough to try opening her mouth and speak in the face if the older girl's intensity.
	“To Ron, Hermione, and the newest Weasley!
	“You didn’t have to!” Hermione shouted, intemperate rage coursing through her.
	"I'm going to tell them everything, anyways," Hermione admits.
	Hermione doubled over upon planting her feet on sodden earth, panting from the effort; she rounded on the nutcracker the moment she caught her breath, managing, "We have to find them.
	The potion was blood red in Bellatrix’s hands and she carried it to Hermione, noticing how the young woman’s eyes raked over her.
	“I...we are with our friends and not in public,” Hermione said in a breathless voice.
	Previously: In the low light, Hermione got a vague impression of changes that had been made since she 'd set wards on the house with Harry after the war.
	He probably just thinks we’re a bunch of young drunks, Hermione mused.
	"That you did," Black replied, her eyes scanning Hermione in a way that was too slow to be appropriate.
	Genuine shock reached the other siren’s eyes, Bellatrix scrambled to reach out and grab onto the front of her sweater; the witch’s single arm being the only thing keeping Hermione and Crookshanks from plunging to their deaths.
	Hermione stood tall and pointed her wand at his chest, grounding her bare feet into the carpet beneath her and trying to connect to the energy of the earth.
	), and she’d been immediately struck by how pale Hermione seemed.
	Hermione.
	An eternal connection, you are so lucky, Hermione.” Hermione gets to her feet.
	That’s exactly what she tastes like.” He pushed Abraxas’s head back down between Hermione’s legs and smiled up at her.
	"Sorry I'm late, ready to go Hermione?"
	"I mean it, Trix," Hermione narrowed her eyes.
	"Okay then," Hermione sighed, shaking her head as he went.
	Bellatrix finally relented and let the centaur lift Hermione.
	Hermione was confident that she owed a life debt or two to plenty of people.
	Hermione wrote copious notes in all her classes, as usual, and managed to hold herself back to answering only every other question, which worked out well, since Tom answered most of the others in DADA and Herbology.
	Hermione shudders.
	Hermione looked away as her chest tightened.
	Hermione laughed lightly, then sighed.
	Frankly, Harry didn’t stand a chance, particularly when Hermione found her route of attack.
	Hermione nodded.
	Hermione knew that the ‘filth’ was anyone, not pure-blood or who held with pure-blood doctrines.
	"Blimey, Hermione!"
	Hermione sighs and crosses her arms over her chest, just as Kreacher spoons healthy amounts of steaming stew onto their plates.
	Maybe it's Granger."
	“It’s been in the Malfoy family for generations, passed down to each new fiancée.” The word rang in Hermione’s ears, as Narcissa continued, the ring glinting.
	Bellatrix rapped her knuckles against Hermione’s head like she was a petulant child.
	Unlike Hermione’s energetic, barely contained magic, Narcissa’s was tightly controlled, like a well-trained pet, and it didn’t cast nearly as wide of a circle around her.
	Hermione closed her eyes, her head settling against his chest.
	Hermione made a sound between a scoff and a choke.
	Hermione watched Astoria make her way over to Malfoy.
	“I'm sorry, Miss Granger.
	It was distorted enough by the crackling of the flames that Harry was confident Dumbledore wouldn't recognize it, but he nudged Hermione anyway in warning.
	Hermione said.
	"Greatest respect tastes pretty damn good," Dan Granger declared, taking another sip of wine.
	Hermione shouted.
	“Neither.” Hermione said proudly “He broke free of it.” “Thanks.” Harry lied back as Pomfrey quickly explained the detection spell- mostly to Hermione- potio revelio.
	"Hermione," he said softly.
	"Fred," Hermione sighed.
	Hermione gave a shaky nod, then closed her eyes, pushing the earthy tome back even farther.
	"So the sword isn't at Hogwarts," Hermione sighs.
	Later, from Grimmauld Place, it would seem to Hermione that she could barely remember the wedding itself.
	Draco was looking from one to the other, Hermione wasn't angry yet, just annoyed, which put his mind at ease.
	"There were times when I wondered if you were actually real," said Hermione.
	"Don't laugh, Granger," he scolded her, and somehow his tone set her off again.
	Hermione looked down at their joined hands.
	“Oh yeah?” Bellatrix says quietly, limping forwards a few steps, past Hermione and reaching Draco.
	Hermione snorted and rolled her eyes.
	"I don't think I dare ask," Hermione chuckled.
	Granger stared at him as if he’d gone mad.
	They discussed Bella and Hermione’s return to school making sure not to mention any names, just in case of a random eavesdropper.
	"Yes," Hermione said, eyeing the glass in his hand.
	Hermione drew her wand out and raised it, a trio of blue lights appearing around her head.
	Hermione heads into the bathroom.
	Hermione said and the sharpness in her eyes had Harry relaxing– Hermione would never purposefully lead him into danger, that he was confident in.
	Riddle turned his attention fully to her again, and Hermione braced herself, ready for his alluring grin.
	“Hermione,” she corrected, smirking.
	Malfoy’s fingers slid across the fabric of her knickers and Hermione wailed and parted her legs for him.
	"It's going to be my absolute pleasure, Hermione.
	Truly, Hermione, if you accept my offer of marriage, I want you to know that the Malfoy title, lands, and power are yours to leverage as you see fit.” But I will work to earn your love, Hermione.
	“Lumos,” Hermione said, and light bloomed at the tip of her wand.
	Hermione was just as confused as Harry was, but hadn’t learned, as Harry and Ginny knew, that sometimes it was best to just roll with it when it came to their friend.
	The entire area around Hermione vibrated by the snarl of fury that abruptly filled the air.
	Hermione blinked, a little confused… and then started laughing.
	“That’s horrible,” Hermione wasn’t able to stop the words.
	“I found what I was missing to remove your Dark Mark,” Hermione said when Draco walked through the door to her room after lunch the next day.
	“Your...your cousin?” Hermione turned to the wolf standing in the doorway.
	“Hermione is going to step in for me.
	"You're just looking for a way to change the subject before Ron comes down from upstairs and finds out about your out of dress code with his sister story,"Hermione said skimming the front page and flipping inside.
	Hermione stood like she was in a trance.
	“Hermione Granger.” He sauntered up to her desk, ignoring Fawley’s little cough and simpered greeting, and casually sat against the edge of the wood, kicking one scuffed black boot—dragonhide, pricy—up onto his opposite knee.
	Hermione did her best not to stare.
	"Granger, you let me in this instant or next time I'll tie you to the bed and fuck you raw."
	Taking the phial, Hermione clutched it in a tight fist—and then wrapped her other hand around that hand to keep everything steady.
	Hermione hummed skeptically, a frown ghosting over her forehead.
	Hello, Draco.” He turned back to Hermione and whispered, “Until we meet again, Miss Granger.” He took her hand and kissed the back softly before he turned on his black dragon hide boots and strode purposefully away.
	Malfoy turned back toward Hermione.
	"Fine, so say you get this to work, Hermione's parents anyway.
	"Boys," Hermione mumbled, following his flailing limbs out of the bedroom and into the kitchen where Remus was already ready to go.
	"Miss Granger, it's not for me to say what would have happened if you hadn't done what you ended up doing.
	Hermione took a bite and then another big gulp of wine.
	"Of course," Hermione agreed.
	Hermione looked at her and found Pansy grinning.
	Hermione’s face fell.
	Oh, Voldemort couldn't harm her or Harry, of course, but Hermione had grown to care for more people then just Harry– something Voldemort was, no doubt, very aware of.
	Hermione glared at him.
	Hermione giggled.
	Hermione recognises that shade of blonde.
	Hermione didn't even know how that was possible that he was somehow still at Hogwarts despite being held back so many times, until she realized that his family was 'big in the Ministry' and that being likely a factor.
	"You're so wet..." Hermione whispered.
	Taking another drink, Hermione shuddered.
	Ginny and Hermione’s eyes met briefly.
	Besides, I highly doubt Hermione Granger would've been too thrilled over the idea of being my fuckbuddy."
	Vinda and Narcissa sat in the library waiting for the allotted time for Hermione to finish purifying herself, the only sound in the room was the low crackling of the fire.
	Seriously, if Lockhart didn't quit this annoying habit of repeating his name over and over and sounding rather perverted, Harry couldn't possibly be held responsible for his actions during the Cornish Pixie…lesson, he supposed was the word, but they really hadn't learned anything except Hermione was smarter than their Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor and really, hadn't they all already thought that?
	When she recovered, Hermione was staring at her with her back to the window, eyes alight with raw fury as the moonlight illuminated her silhouette.
	It took several long seconds before Hermione could place him and her jaw went slack.
	Hermione quips, and Fred looks at her challengingly while Neville scurries to the table and takes a seat on Percy's side.
	"It's my fault," Hermione spoke up, finally moving away from the wall.
	"Hermione!"
	Hermione gawked at him, both amazed and envious.
	Hermione was smiling and saying hello to those that had rushed the door to see them, but she didn't have a face she was looking for.
	Draco smiled against her lips as Hermione wiggled her slick cunt along his cock.
	Hermione asked, honestly looking interested in what he had to say.
	Hermione asked, giving him her best innocent look.
	He mouthes an apology, but continues to stare at Hermione like she’s grown a second head.
	Hermione snorted but nodded her head.
	The giggles subsided and Hermione found herself gazing into Bellatrix' dark eyes.
	"Tilly," Hermione mumbled, trying to tug her dress away from the house-elf's hands.
	Emma Granger stood and slammed her book shut.
	Hermione looked over to the door, praying that no-one was being nosy.
	Hermione looked up at Mrs Weasley, patted her hand gently, “I haven’t been a child since Samhain when I did my Rite, in reality, Olde Magic considers me an adult in the wizarding world already.
	Hermione felt his arm stead herself around the shoulders and while she was midway through thanking him a glimpse of gold hovered next to his ear.
	Hermione straightened in her chair.
	Hermione bit her lip and gave the table a wary glance.
	Every time she'd let her mind wander, it would conjure images of Draco with Hermione's doppelgänger in his lap, moving as Pansy Parkinson moves and kissing like Pansy Parkinson kisses.
	Hermione let out a sigh.
	“Fuck—Hermione, you are…” His hand trailed along her hip to the soft dip of her waist, and he felt as though the entire point of his existence was lying beneath him.
	Hermione squeezing his arm as though telling him to slow down.
	"Is that..." Hermione asked.
	Bellatrix only doubled her efforts and Hermione’s eyes rolled, unable to keep focused on anything but the way her entire body seemed to be rolling with wave after wave of ecstatic electricity, until it built and built and she felt as though she might explode.
	Hermione bristled a bit.
	“Are you alright, Granger?
	Hermione's mind raced as she recalled all the specifics of Eloise Mintumble's case files.
	"Want to tell me a story Hermione?
	Hermione shrugged and slipped her hand into his relieved the crowd was still amazingly leaving them alone.
	"Hermione-" The crowd had shifted over the course of the show and Hermione thought she saw a few of the Hags that frequented the Leaky Cauldron trying to figure out a ticket kiosk.
	Hermione's eyes snapped up from the book she had been reading, oblivious to her porridge which was half-forgotten and dripping from her drooping spoon back into the bowl.
	There was a flurry of activity when Gellert arrived with Hermione in his arms.
	He sighed and suddenly looked so exhausted Hermione thought he might just fall backwards.
	“Miss Granger,” he said, startling her from her thoughts.
	Hermione thought about this for a moment.
	“Hermione,” Ron hissed, laying a hand on her arm.
	"No, I meant..." Hermione pouted a little when she realized she likely wouldn't be back here for several hours.
	He lifted Hermione's chin with his fingers, tilted her head backward, and pinched her small nose with his large, callused fingers before adjusting her chin to part her lips.
	He doesn’t especially want to hang around with Ron and Hermione either at the moment.
	Hermione shook her head.
	"Hermione?"
	Apparently, Sirius had gotten it into his head that Hermione would simply fall back into his arms the second she stepped off the train – he had given her time to herself after all – but that was not the case.
	Hermione gave him a hug.
	He'd just got back from checking the ministry records and Miss Granger's parents had indeed appointed Lord Slytherin as their child's magical guardian.
	Hermione was sitting in the Rose Room when Tom found her staring out the French doors and out into the gardens.
	Hermione asked, nodding her head to the bed.
	Hermione turned her head to the side and smiled at the elderly witch who was looking at her expectantly, “I think I know where I’m going, I’m here to visit my aunt and uncle that were admitted some years ago with spell damage.
	"This is a war, Granger."
	Hermione cast a few more cleansing charms on Thad’s clothes and body, though it seemed like Corvus had done solid work.
	Hermione remembered the feeling of needing to see Bellatrix, of needing to be with her and not let her pull away.
	“Did you still want that spank-fucking, Miss Granger?” The dark chocolate baritone of Snape’s inquiry was nothing short of orgasmic.
	“Interesting choice of friends, Granger.
	(Hermione) Hermione came home from work Tuesday evening to find a bundle of roses on her doorstep, thee blooms orange, the edges tipped in blood red, as if the sunset had melted across each petal.
	In the room, Hermione quickly gathered up the few things that weren't in her bag, the one with the charm on it, and then sighed, sitting on the bed.
	Hermione left him alone about it.
	“Maybe.” Hermione considers.
	Malfoy and the rest of them had distanced themselves from her, Granger, Tracey, and Blaise.
	“Did Hermione run to you, tell you how bad I’ve been?” Tom could hear the edge in his voice.
	Taking a shuddering breath, Hermione turned back to the sideboard, grabbed a spare serviette, and gingerly wrapped it around the tongs.
	Hermione had not really considered grooming preferences before.
	Hermione Granger would die as a siren no matter what she did.
	“The Grangers should go first.
	Next to Hermione, Ron mirrored Sirius's actions.
	He didn't like that Jessup was making appearances in Diagon Alley, not in such proximity to Hermione.
	"My young wife," he explained, offering a conspiratorial expression of sheepishness; Hermione gaped in disbelief as the other patrons shrugged impassively, turning away in disinterest.
	Ginny looked a bit uncomfortable, but Hermione couldn’t detect any anger in her face.
	Hestia's face was impassive as Hermione frowned at her.
	“Yeah…?” Ginny sounded like she wasn’t quite sure where Hermione was going but was willing to listen anyway.
	And since when did you start ‘speaking’ to me?” Hermione griped.
	Ron and Hermione going to the prefect’s carriage on the train was really not pleasant at all.
	Hermione shuddered.
	Miss Granger, you didn't sugar coat it when you said these two were extraordinary."
	When were you going to tell me that Hermione Granger is your sister?” They had just assumed that Granger was some secret sibling, one kept hidden for unknown reasons.
	Hermione used a knife-scarred hand to tug the slipping pyjama sleeve back up which was slightly disappointing and Tom turned his attention back to the conversation.
	Hermione dipped her head to hide her grin and handed him the cup.
	Hermione doubled over, her palms landing in the grass.
	If she can’t see Hermione.
	Curious, he stood up and followed Hermione, peering over her shoulder.
	The three of them tried returning to their breakfast, which proved difficult as every now and again Ron would try and find a guy for Hermione other than Harry, Hermione finally finished the Rigby article while Harry sat, searching the Great Hall for Luna.
	“Hermione, I don’t think-” I thought we were friends Hermione!” He growled.
	After his first visit to the Merrythought estate, when he’d complained in passing to Hermione that the soap in his bathroom smelled like an old woman’s perfume, it had been replaced the next day with a freshly milled bar scented with cedar and myrrh.
	Harry rolled his eyes and nodded to Hermione, who unceremoniously dumped the diadem onto the ground.
	He knew it was Hermione's diary.
	Hermione was content to simply watch, alternating between sipping water and champagne, enjoying herself probably too much for something so ostentatious.
	Harry scratched the back of his head nervously and wondered why Hermione looked like she was two seconds away from beaning him with her trunk.
	Taking the chance, Hermione shot the cutting curse at Bellatrix.
	"If you think any harder you're hair is going to go all bushy like Granger," George said with a smirk.
	"Good night, Hermione," he said, brushing her fingers.
	“I don’t care,” Hermione quipped back.
	Healer Stroud was indifferent to Hermione’s poorly-concealed rage.
	It felt as though Hermione had been abruptly forced deep under freezing water; no air, and pressure, as though she were being crushed on all sides.
	Hermione grimaced.
	“Hermione—fuck, please, don’t say these kinds of things to me.” His hands on her shoulders tightened, and his voice was almost a low groan.
	He really wants to tell Ron and Hermione the truth, really, he does.
	Hermione continues staring.
	I smell like Hermione because she is mine.
	But, Hermione always has her reasons.
	"Wonder who he's loyal to," Hermione said thoughtfully as she looked across the water where Hagrid was in his own little boat, leading the others.
	“What is it?” Hermione asked once there was no one within hearing distance of them.
	Monday morning Hermione found herself knocking at Mott’s office door in the Department of Mysteries.
	Hermione decided that Victoria Rosier did not look beautiful at all with that sneering expression on her face.
	Hermione rubs at her head and reaches into her other pocket, pulling out her wand for the witch to see.
	When they had landed on the step to Number 12, Hermione hadn't realized Yaxley had gone with them.
	“Okay,” Hermione agreed, though she wasn’t sure how exactly she would go about doing that.
	Upon approaching the staff table, they discovered that Eileen's birthday gift for Hermione was an ordinary bouquet of freesias.
	Hermione didn’t know how long she knelt before the fireplace.
	Hermione paused, irritated.
	Draco didn't push him to talk, but Hermione couldn't seem to resist nagging him.
	His back was to the door but could tell it was Miss Granger the moment she neared the room.
	Hermione understood that immediately.
	Hermione is more than a match for him.” Hermione hoped that was true.
	Damnit, Hermione thinks.
	“Well, Hermione, I never had you down as a rule-breaker,” Anthony said with an expression of glee.
	Slamming her Occlumency shields in place, Hermione tried to push past the cold that went deeper then her skin, the cold that was inside her chest, inside her very heart... As it was, the Dementor just got angry and swooped forwards, her shields started weakening, cracking, the dread was growing, there was a rushing in her ears... Take Hermione!
	“Interesting perception you have of me, Hermione… We must toast to my kindness more often then.” Hermione opened her mouth, about to try and argue the point, but started laughing before she could even start.
	Hermione nodded sharply, blinking back tears.
	Hermione blinked at his retreating back.
	“I had a wonderful time as well, Hermione.
	Where Hermione melted Draco with passion, Severus was more like a churning whirlpool of excitement that whipped his insides to a buttery flurry.
	"Hermione?"
	“I am unwilling to part with a single item on that list, Miss Granger.” He walked around his chair, and placed his hands on its back.
	Hermione and Daphne spent far too much of their time on other matters to keep pace.
	Grabbing Hermione by her throat, she slammed the younger siren against the ground and began speaking in a menacing tone.
	“I know it’s not what you would have chosen,” Hermione soothed, putting a tentative hand on Harry’s arm.
	"This is your master plan, Granger?"
	Hermione waited, not daring to speak.
	Hermione crawled to his side and gave him another lingering kiss.
	Hermione said nothing to prompt him, only listened with quiet patience.
	Hermione was now allowing the young girl to touch her.
	“Hermione’s not tainted.
	“And let me guess; the only person Hermione’s siren side can’t fight against…” He drifted off.
	Another flash of pain across her eyes: though she didn't say it out loud, it was clear to Hermione that Bellatrix felt like she was letting her grandfather down.
	"You can say that again," Hermione mumbled under her breath.
	Hermione takes a breath.
	Hermione opened her mouth, an indignant sound popping out, and felt her blood boil.
	Their first proper use of Hermione’s prize had raised as many questions as it had answered.
	Hermione comes to a stop.
	Hermione: "He really is."
	Hermione’s brain wasn’t working properly; she was sure that she had never been so bewildered by such a simple expression of happiness before.
	Though she was shooting glares at Draco the whole time while he was introducing himself, Hermione was quick to see just how close the three Black sisters were.
	Hermione felt herself shift into ‘action-mode’.
	"Hermione, before you go, I just want to say I'm sorry about before…" Hermione waved him off.
	Hermione tried to ignore the flare of jealousy.
	Hermione turned away again, this time quickly continuing on her way.
	"Team Harry," he said, grinning, before he hurriedly slipped out the door, just missing the impact of the fruit basket Hermione had flung in his direction.
	Ron and Hermione are screaming at each other — for sport, Harry’s seen them do it before, they like to have perfectly normal conversations at the tops of their voices in the middle of family fights because they think it’s funny — and Teddy is scream-singing his favorite song, which is about a mischievous cabbage, if Harry’s remembering right.
	Hermione wrapped her arms around her knees, resting her chin on her kneecaps.
	Cause Hermione wasn’t quite sure what she would do if she didn’t.
	A detail clicked into place as Hermione watched her leave.
	"Hermione?
	Hermione nodded.
	Hermione smiles politely, trying to hide the pride she feels.
	“Hermione get away from her!
	By the time Hermione put down her omniculars, Bellatrix was already putting on her clothes hastily.
	Hermione groaned.
	White wasn't exactly a colour he associated with Hermione, but she wore it well– and he suspected the innocence of the look wasn't a coincidence.
	Granger sucked in her breath.
	Hermione pushes her hair back over an ear.
	“Erm…thank you, Hermione—” He reverses their positions, stepping in front of Hermione again and saying, “Wait.
	It was Hermione's turn to sit in silence.
	"Hermione Black sounds better.
	Hermione gave a weak smile and entered the room.
	It seemed this wand reacted just as powerfully to Hermione's emotions as it had to Bellatrix's.
	"Remus, I'm not a Gryffindor," Hermione protested as he dragged her along to the common room anyway.
	Hermione let out a brief cry, taking a step backwards only to trip over a branch and full straight on her bum.
	Both she and Andie looked and listened as she and the mysterious Hermione inside the pool started their chanting after taking out their daggers and running it across the palm of their hands.
	“Hermione, I really like you.
	“What did you do to it?” Hermione said, shaking her head in disbelief.
	By the end of the first week, Hermione had left a class with her and hidden in the bathroom to cry.
	Harry, noting that Hermione's cheeks looked particularly heated with temper, decided it would be best to keep quiet.
	Hermione squeezed her eyes closed at the raw sound of Draco's voice.
	Hermione looked at him in confusion.
	"Obviously you'll take more than the six treatments," Hermione continues, "according to the book, the first treatment is the only one which causes you to sleep.
	Hermione smirked at her as she walked passed her and went to her room.
	“Then I’m sure she understands your reticence.”  “I’ll think about it.”  They both heard Hermione giggling, and turned to see her stumble through the kitchen door with Draco, the two of them grappling with each other like a couple of randy teenagers.
	Even if Hermione could make herself cast the curse—even if it wouldn't come out as that strangled scream she'd released when she'd seen Hagrid carrying Harry's limp body—Harry had been included in those she couldn't act against.
	He had regained some color, but Hermione still felt uneasy.
	There was a slight hint of nervousness from the youngest Black sister, something Hermione only picked up on because she was so used to Bellatrix’s own micro-expressions.
	But Harry loved Hermione.
	At one point, Tom did something out of Harry's view that caused Hermione to suck in a shocked breath and Tom seemed to take that as encouragement.
	Hermione knew it was merely her robe he was tearing, only a transfigured dress and not the real thing, but the action was so hateful, so cruel.
	She had been pretty good about it, she had admitted when she told Hermione, but when she retold the story she seemed to have lost some of that strong bravado the Weasley's always put off in matters of the heart.
	Hermione twisted a little to lie on her back, looking up at Bellatrix, who removed her fingersr and just smiled.
	Luna moved to stand beside Hermione.
	But to complicate matters, the inimitable Miss Granger had somehow entered my office before I retired there with Draco and hid herself.
	He was so close that Hermione could count the lashes framing his eyes if she wanted.
	The prophecy—none of it’s to do with you, Hermione, it’s my problem.”  They deduced that the sixth horcrux was Voldemort’s snake, Nagini—and the impossibility of destroying her loomed large and incalculable in the forefront of Hermione’s mind.
	Washes over them, and Hermione practically wails as she grabs hold of Bellatrix.
	“Don’t you get tired of this?” Hermione can’t help but ask.
	On Christmas morning, Hermione snuck down to the Conservatory to clip a few lilies that magically grew year-round.
	Hermione or Ginny cast diagnostics every hour to see if she’d even effaced fully and kept finding that she somehow hadn’t.
	Hermione's lips curved into a smirk, the curve of it just shy of bloodthirsty, as she rolled off him, propping herself up on one elbow to look across.
	She was still crying when Hermione woke from the dream.
	“I can’t believe our exams are over,” Hermione murmured.
	Hermione looked down and gave a low sigh before looking back up.
	Hermione tapped one finger against the glass.
	When laying on the top queen-sized bunk bed, Hermione could understand why the top bunk was so popular.
	Hermione stood, drew her arm back and threw, stepping forward with the throw.
	Her clit flared to life, and Hermione’s breathy giggling stuttered to a gasp.
	Hermione feels her face start to tingle as the transfiguration wears off, her hair growing and nose shrinking.
	Hermione paused, watching him carefully.
	Hermione?
	"Granger," Draco blurted painfully, "I can't spend the night here with you.
	She grinned, flinging her arm around Hermione's shoulders and squeezing.
	Dobby clears his throat and points at Hermione with a glare.
	Stupid, Hermione.
	“I don’t know why you insist trying to introduce more of your little friends to me when I barely tolerate these.” He gestured to Granger and Weasley.
	Of course, before they could settle into this new life and come to grips with what happened, Hermione started to pant and mewl in pain again, making Abraxas touch his free hand to his heart in an attempt to calm it and tensing the hand resting on her neck in an attempt to calm her.
	Hermione listened as the woman’s haunting voice began to echo around the bone garden; ready and eager to hear what words would fall from those smirking lips.
	“That’s not true!” cried Hermione.
	Hermione automatically jerked her back, but Cailleach's grip was like iron, and the fey Queen bent forwards, brushing her red lips against Hermione's own.
	"Hey, Hermione, long time no talky.
	Hermione looked down.
	Hermione struggled not to flinch at the threat.
	Severus made some noises when they had sex, but Hermione knew she was much louder.
	Hermione is worried even further now, and Alicia tries to talk her down from panicking.
	"The more you tell me about his tastes, the faster this will go," Cho said, and then she was tugging Hermione's dress down her hips to pool around her heels.
	Hermione just hugs the cushion more tightly.
	“Hermione, I know I said I wouldn’t say anything else, but I have to say all this at least once before I go and leave you here.” Her throat dipped as she swallowed.
	Hermione smiles through a nervous laugh.
	Hermione extended her arms and posed for him, turning to let him see the seams running up her stockings.
	"Hullo, Severus," Hermione said quietly as she stepped into his lab.
	"Granger, we'll discuss your rules next time, but if I don't fuck you right now I'll be scratching my eyeballs out next."
	Hermione felt her face grow red and drew her hand away.
	He was rattled, and Hermione was unnerved by it.
	Hermione continues smiling.
	Luna had her head titled quizzically, clearly waiting for Hermione to finish.
	"Harry, hi—it's Hermione Granger," said Hermione Granger, heading excitedly towards him and sounding as if she thought (incorrectly) that perhaps he didn't remember her from school.
	Black smirked at him as he pulled Hermione closer to him.
	Hermione looks down and sighs.
	This didn't absolve Snape at all in the minds of Ron and Hermione.
	Hermione's temple throbbed.
	Hermione had stormed out and apparated away from the Burrow, spending the rest of the day in Diagon Alley shopping for her return to school supplies.
	Hermione can empathise with that easily enough.
	Hermione, however, looked decidedly uncomfortable.
	Alex and Hermione had been at each others throats in group combat training more so than anyone else in Harry's group.
	Hermione shook her head and smiled.
	Hermione was almost certain Ollivander was fetching the yew wand.
	Hermione balled her left hand into a fist so tight she could feel her nails biting into her palm and the shape of her metacarpal bones under her fingertips.
	“Yes,” Hermione said softly with an undercurrent to her voice that Bellatrix did not understand, “it is.” Bella liked Hermione.
	Hermione gasped as they started to waltz together to the music.
	"Hermione dear," sounded the voice of her mother, accompanied by a pat on the leg.
	Hermione: "FINE!
	Granger is one of Potter's closest friends and spends the most time with him, but a bad break-up could spell the end of that powerful friendship.
	Hermione was suddenly reminded of a similar scene from years ago, one that involved a little dragon the man had gotten from a man in a bar.
	“Many of them wouldn’t leave if we offered,” Hermione said.
	Whenever people caught Harry alone, they tried to get him to stop and talk to them but everyone knew better then to approach him when Hermione was by his side and Harry very much doubted anyone was stupid enough to approach Hermione when she was on her own.
	“Can’t imagine what you’re telling me that for,” Hermione chuckled, leaning back into her.
	Hermione's chest felt like it was collapsing as Giuliana squeezed her fingers, firing off questions.
	Harry found his focus drifting across the bond, and he found that both Hermione and Ginny were ‘warming themselves up’  Oh yes, I am looking forward to this, luv.
	"'Thaddeus' is my 'relative'," Hermione said, snorting slightly at the truly preposterous lie.
	The walls shook, and Hermione crumpled to the floor, leaning her cheek against the side of her bed.
	Scoffing, Hermione tossed her a look.
	Hermione caught the way the muscles in his neck tensed when he shook Riddle's hand.
	Severus ducked his face Hermione’s hair to hide his smirk.
	Hermione just follows them up the stairs.
	Maybe it says Bellatrix will torture her and then die…or that Hermione would impersonate her, but it would fail…or that they would duel at Hogwarts before Molly kills her.
	“You don’t get to come, Hermione.
	And— and besides—Bellatrix is— well Hermione is— Thetis winks at Hermione, and dips under the water.
	I mean, she's Hermione, so she's brilliant—" Dean: "—so we convinced Mafalda Hopkirk that Hermione was doing such a good job in our department that she needed a position with more responsibility."
	Another flash, and Hermione was gone as well.
	Hermione was laughing and scrunching her face in distaste.
	Hermione just listens.
	To trust Hermione.
	She had so many titles to her name it was quite ridiculous, but Hermione preferred to call her a mingebag, just not to her face.
	"This is Hermione Granger."
	"My," Narcissa hummed, and Hermione felt her face turn beet red at the barely concealed grin spreading across her features.
	Hermione didn't bother to correct her, not sure how the younger Bellatrix would react.
	“And he’s supposed to be our teacher!”  Harry and Ron moved angrily toward him, but Hermione was the quickest—SMACK!
	You’re a Gryffindor, Miss Granger, there’s no doubt about that.
	There was a chill in Hermione's stomach, a cold swell of nausea as the familiar sensation of adrenaline coursing through her veins had her body tensed and ready to react to the slightest of sounds as she and Harry stood there against the wall and panted.
	Hermione’s eyes focused in on the dragon’s tail taking the blunt of the attack.
	Hornet ordered and Hermione flashed her a strained smile.
	Hermione couldn’t even push through the one closest to her before a blackened hand shot out and grabbed a hold of her.
	Did he look at Hermione as someone who might fit into those plans?
	Hermione smiles up at her.
	Hermione's stomach sank.
	Hermione stretched, snuggling her back against Sirius' chest as she stared at the fireplace.
	Sometimes you have to let someone else in to make sure you'll have a future," said Bellatrix, eyes now locked with Hermione's.
	Hermione gasped, blushing.
	Hermione grumbles to herself and runs her hands over her face.
	Hermione was quick to turn away as that was a sight she didn’t want to be burned into her brain.
	Hermione smiles sadly.
	"Hermione, congratulations again.
	Hermione was, on average, a head shorter then most of her year level, Daphne included.
	"Um, Granger.
	One of these days I'll let go of some control in the kitchen and teach Hermione.
	Hermione had to agree; the clouds were swirling above them.
	"Hermione?"
	Hermione.
	Hermione, who hadn’t stopped blushing through her entire explanation, nodded, and then added a soft “I’m sorry, Ginny.” “I don’t know what to say, Hermione.
	Hermione: "Right, but just really quick—"  [The letter dissolves into nothing, leaving Hermione and Draco in silence.]
	They’ll start using it in the field soon.”  “What type?”  “Contagious acid boils.”  Hermione pressed her lips together, and drew a sharp breath.
	He returned her to the holding room, and Hermione didn’t even flinch as his hand passed over her backside.
	Will Hermione break her heart?
	"Wait, Granger, hang on—" "Lady Revel's House of Fortune, Athena speaking," Hermione said.
	Hermione reached down between them to take a loose grip on his cock.
	Abruptly appearing at Hermione's side, she takes hold of her arm and tugs her a little ways down the corridor.
	Hermione is in love with Severus.
	Hermione can't speak.
	Hermione steps towards her to stare into her eyes in awe.
	“Oh, Hermione.
	"I don't," said Hermione quickly.
	Hermione nods.
	If you need more proof of the atrocities visited upon me, I’ll give the last memory.” Hermione sank back against her pillow, trembling.
	A door appeared in the expanse of stone, and Hermione took the handle and pulled it open.
	"Yes, well," Hermione clears her throat, sounding a little flustered, and briefly Harry wonders if she is embarrassed by finding something Draco said to be funny.
	Hermione's cheeks turned pink.
	Harry gaped, looking over at Hermione, who nodded sadly.
	Hermione felt her heartbeat in her fingertips.
	", but Hermione was listening to the clamoring that had started behind him.
	Ginny was pale under her freckles and Hermione didn't envy the younger woman the pressure she was under.
	Harry catches Hermione's eyes and raises an eyebrow because – really?
	"Unfortunate as that may be, I regret to inform you, Miss Granger, that I know of no way to send you home."
	“Wait!” Hermione said.
	“Will you, Hermione Granger, present the details of my offer to Severus Snape and return here within two hour's time to deliver his answer?” Hermione felt light-headed.
	"Oh my god, stop," Hermione said, looking like she was trying not to laugh.
	“It would have been helpful if our blackmailing friend had been a tiny bit more specific about where to meet,” Hermione says loudly, over the sound of Ron’s muttering.
	The more she punished Hermione, the more pain Umbridge would be in at the end.
	"Lady Revel's House of Fortune, Athena speaking," said Hermione Granger's voice, followed by, "Sorry, are you alright?"
	Hermione's voice was hard as she spoke.
	Hermione laughed.
	Hermione smiled brightly and pulled Rose into the booth next to her as Etan slid in next to Draco.
	The epilogue will be posted as a stand alone as it will include both Fred and Hermione’s POV.
	'– the girl obviously talked a good game in the sense that she was utterly breathtaking, but Hermione liked someone with brains behind their beauty.
	If Harry was a god (and Hermione was ready to get on her knees and worship him) then Ginny was his goddess.
	"Don't be silly," Hermione brushes him off casually, keeping her eyes away from Alicia, Fred, and George.
	Hermione's heart had already been thumping loudly in her chest, but when she heard Black speak, right behind her, it tried to jump up in to her throat, out of her mouth and run away.
	By the time Daphne calmed down, Hermione had satiated her curiosity and Luna had stopped being quite so Luna.
	Hermione had been right, Severus really was doing the bare minimum.
	And so Hermione found herself alone once again and opted to make her way to the loo instead of chancing any more unfortunate run-ins.
	Hermione watched as Black stood from her chair and left the hall through one of the doors behind the top table.
	“Hermione,” he groaned, his voice ragged.
	“None other.” Bixby had written the piece on the Foundation some months earlier, and Hermione knew the roly-poly reporter had all but fallen in love with her on the spot.
	“Then don’t try and drown me, you absolute madwoman!” Hermione returned.
	Hermione informed her briskly.
	Hermione pretended not to notice.
	Yet here he was in Hermione’s bed because she was—his mistress.
	he asked, then his eyes widened as he looked between Hermione and Draco, realizing what kinds of answers Draco would most likely give.
	I will invent it if I have to.” Hermione’s voice shook with intensity.
	Hermione burst out laughing and he looked surprised for a moment before smiling back at her.
	“You weren’t meant to,” Hermione countered impatiently.
	Hermione sat still as a statue.
	"You seem more sane then last time," Harry said before he could stop himself and Hermione gave a soft groan from beside him.
	Hermione Granger-Malfoy let out a loud, exhausted sigh.
	Hermione gasped and had her wand in her hand before she’d even opened her eyes, her arm extended out in front of her.
	“Go lie down facing Hermione.” Draco nodded again, and as soon as Snape let him go, Draco scuttled into place, easing up to Hermione and stretching out on his side so they were heart to heart.
	Sirius lifted his wand hand higher, a curse on his lips directed at Kreacher when Hermione's arm shot out and grabbed his wrist, ”Please, don't!” Hermione held her ground giving Sirius a level look.
	Hermione digs two fingers in to his side and he yelps, releasing her quick.
	I’ve been thinking about what to do,” Hermione quickly explained the book Abraxas had sent them earlier.
	Hermione asked, her voice soft and face visibly concerned.
	“All right,” Hermione said.
	“Damn, Hermione…” “I know,” Hermione sighed, waving her wand to bring the room back to order and the stools and desks back to their original positions.
	He would have found a way to punish his only true Ravenclaw if he hadn’t known that upsetting Hermione was the best way to upset Patience.
	All he'd been able to think about was how much Potter's death would hurt Hermione, how it'd be like when Severus had lost Lily.
	Hermione felt her heart drumming against her ribcage.
	True, it was unrecognizable; Hermione had essentially had the house gutted—I considered razing it to the ground and forcing Draco to live elsewhere, she'd admitted on one occasion, but it has quite a lovely set of gardens—but there was still the strange sensation of worlds colliding.
	Next Chapter: Fred ferries another letter and Hermione grapples with what has happened to the timelines and a very important bracelet finds its way to her wrist... "Hogsmeade Station," Hermione answered, shifting the weight of the case into her other hand, "Hogwarts front door would be better but—" "Right," Hermione said, taking her ticket and dropping her pay into the dish before headed to one of the open seats.
	Hermione pressed a gentle kiss to the cut, her lips holding no more weight than her breath on his skin.
	Hermione squeezes her hand.
	Harry traded bewildered looks with Hermione, but they still followed as Blaise led the way down the Alley, to a part where Harry hadn't been before– restaurants, cafes and what he thought might be a bar lined the cobbled pathways, and Blaise led them to the most expensive, classy restaurant there, the emblazoned gold letters declaring its name to be Matrona.
	Hermione asked.
	Theo presses, and Hermione nods.
	Hermione, even cheerful, was hard-pressed to say something positive about their Divination class.
	Hermione was bent over Ginny — a Ginny who looked like she'd gone five rounds with a heavy-weight boxer, with compound fractures all down her right side — a Ginny who grinned up at her through half-lidded eyes and a bloody mouth missing three teeth, and said, "We won."
	Hermione was sat on a chair while Bellatrix was applying a mix of foul-smelling, thick concoction on her face.
	Severus was sure Lucius thought those chips would fall in his favor, but the fact that he was willing to accept the possibility that Draco might prove victorious was a testament to Hermione’s influence.
	Sirius took charge of Hermione's healing himself since everyone else assumed she was smart enough to know what was best for her.
	"You were doubting me," Hermione said primly.
	Hermione scowled.
	Ginny was spread out at the foot of Hermione's bed eating some of the licorice ropes Fred and George had placed in their bags while Luna flipped through her Quibbler, oblivious to Neville looking at her curiously from his seat.
	The Order needed Hermione back immediately.
	Hermione shuddered.
	Kingsley unfurled it and ran his eyes across it for a minute before stashing it inside his robes and looking at Hermione again.
	It wasn't right for Granger to feel hurt by him and it wasn't right for Granger to be forced to his bed if she took no pleasure in it.
	Hermione, faintly: "Right."
	Hermione rolls her eyes.
	Hermione rolled her eyes.
	Hermione had, however, let him give her a giant leather bag full of galleons.
	You look—you look nice, Hermione."
	“I agree,” Hermione was touched by the lovely and thoughtful gift.
	There was a small pot on the stove, bubbling and Winky appeared almost as soon as Hermione did.
	Hermione hurriedly grabs Snape’s arm before he can reply.
	Determined and a fire lit within her belly- Hermione maneuvered her left hand to face outwards in front of her.
	Hermione asked warily.
	After a long discussion with Tom about how it was important to surround oneself with intelligent and talented people, and that doing schoolwork would help prevent them from looking like some sort of gang, Hermione had convinced him to help her make sure that all the people in group had their homework completed before spending time on other projects.
	It was several hours later that Phineas Nigellus Black sat up straight in his portrait and said loudly, “Headmaster Snape, the Granger girl is summoning me.” Hermione stood, quivering,  in the inky darkness of the upstairs hallway.
	Hermione was beside him, her hand on his back, gently rubbing.
	Hermione drained half her mimosa in one go.
	Hermione’s in rare and terrifying form when he gets there, seventeen open files on her bed and and a container of Chinese food in one hand as she bosses two assistants around.
	Hermione smiled, deciding to take that as a compliment before turning to Harry and arching an eyebrow.
	His perception of Hermione Smith at Ilvermorny could very well vary from hers.
	She can't be jealous of Hermione Granger when she has her war hero ex-boyfriend waltzing in to save the day."
	After Hermione’s final stop, the mobile acquired, they entered the flat through the emerald fire.
	Hermione's mouth twitched.
	Hermione said sarcastically.
	Hermione hesitates, "Are you sure you don't want me to stay up?
	He shifted in his seat (presumably to get some water) and Hermione took that opportune moment to swallow him whole for the second time that night.
	“I’m so sorry,” Hermione said, dropping onto the floor beside him.
	Because of this, business functions had been attended stag for the last nine years, but tonight he had requested Hermione's company due to the fact it was a training night and he enjoyed her company so.
	Hermione couldn’t hear a thing, her ears ringing with all she just heard.
	Hermione let out a cry of frustration.
	That was how long it had been since Hermione had been missing.
	Hermione knew the reason Muggleborns seemed like such an anomaly, it was because there’d been a magical ancestor somewhere in the family line, probably a squib, forced to live in the Muggle world.
	Neville was thus left to try and calm Hermione down.
	Laughing, Granger lowered the flames under both cauldrons and turned to face him.
	Hermione moaned, squirming in crampy discomfort.
	He was planning on meeting her to escort both her and Luna home, saving Luna from the Death Eaters kidnapping as Hermione's journal warned.
	Hermione laughed and grabbed Snape’s arm.
	Hermione hurried after her, a grin on her face.
	Harry remembered Hermione using this same bit of wandless magic on Ron Weasley during their first week at Hogwarts—wandless magic wasn't picked up by the Trace, after all.
	Hermione draws in a deep breath and stares at Fred, and then George.
	"I love you both," said Hermione.
	Hermione dismissed.
	Hermione Granger, the rule follower, the prude of Gryffindoor, was sneaking into the boy’s dormitory for a shag.
	Hermione turned around.
	The code word is starting to feel more like a safeword with the way that the heat is travelling from Hermione’s face down between her legs as she looks up at Bellatrix.
	Hermione said, tone all matter-of-fact.
	What a nightmare of an evening, Hermione thought.
	Hermione realized that Waterstone’s salary for February was a new expense to be paid.
	And despite what Hermione may have thought, Harry did think long and hard about his choices.
	"You're so hard," Hermione breathed over the phone.
	Hermione's eyes dropped to her glass.
	Hermione swallowed the lump in her throat.
	Hermione felt herself blush, but forced herself to laugh.
	Hermione collapsed in Draco's desk chair and unfolded the Prophet with shaking fingers.
	Hermione…" he motioned at her to take over and she smiled as she took a step forward.
	Hermione knocks, even though the door is open.
	Hermione picked up the pitcher, blinking at how light it felt before she realized it was empty.
	Hermione was going to retort except Bellatrix was having none of that at the moment.
	"Fireplace is down the Hall and on your right Miss Granger," the conductor with a jolly mustache smiled, calling her out of her memories "First door on your right if you don't mind."
	Hermione most definitely did not want to know what his idea of fun was, but her incessant curiosity was getting the best of her.
	He struggled to his knees and scowled up at Hermione.
	Something… There were hazy memories--the snake, pain… horrible stinging, a crushing sensation in his chest… the struggle to hold on to sense, to tell Hermione… Tentatively, he lifted his hand to his throat and felt not the bloody, flapping remains of his neck, but his own skin, inviolate, untouched.
	She could barely walk after sex with him," she smiled and looked at Hermione's raised eyebrows.
	“Hermione’s hair already looks like it’s made of clover and daisies.
	"Have a nice night, Hermione," Harry announced with a wink, and with that, he and Ginny were off, racing each other to the dance floor.
	“Call me whatever you want, Granger.
	"Hermione is just a friend."
	Hermione saw Tom’s mouth twist in displeasure, though it didn’t stay that way long.
	The sofa exploded and the sight of the stuffing cascading down between the two of them was enough to make Hermione move.
	Bellatrix was the first to snap out of it, though Hermione was not far behind.
	Hermione didn't show Harry vanquishing the much-altered Tom, but she did allow a glimpse of the aftermath of the final battle—of Tom's thin and wasted corpse being carried away from the rest of the fallen and Harry telling his friends that he'd had to face death in order to remove the Horcrux within him.
	Hermione’s throat closed, and she flinched as he leaned closer.
	Hermione decided she’d had enough binding talk for the moment and decided to stay in the kitchen to help Mrs. Weasley with lunch preparations.
	Ron drops to one knee in front of Hermione, right there in the middle of Knockturn Alley, his robes billowing out behind him in the wind.
	“Of course not,” Hermione muttered, keeping her voice down so as not to startle any more sprites.
	Hermione gave Daphne a curious look.
	Hermione set aside the stave she had been given by Bellatrix and poured herself a cup of tea which she gently put to her lips while heeding Bellatrix' warning.
	Hermione huffed, moving her arm to lamely swat at the wasp to try to shoo him away.
	Hermione threaded her arm through Narcissa's and walked with her down the corridor.
	"Any other questions, Granger?"
	Fred wished he could think of one of them now because there was a person he had forgotten about in his weeks of befriending Hermione.
	Remus scooted closer to Hermione's body and reached for the bottom hem of her shirt, lifting it slightly.
	Of course.” Hermione stepped down one rung to see if the book was misplaced on the shelf below.
	Dearest Hermione, Hermione stroked the fabric of the robes once more before returning them to the box.
	She paused, and Hermione could feel her appraising eyes on her figure even as she stared at the floor.
	It took little time – too little time – for Hermione to realize she was going to climax fabulously from vaginal penetration alone.
	Hermione faltered, adjusting her skirt and crossing her legs at the ankles.
	Of course, right now, Hermione was more curious about something else.
	Hermione made a face.
	Hermione: [nodding] "You know, I was resistant at first, but I think I'm excited to talk about Voldemort's numerous crimes against humanity.
	Harry’s swept into the Great Hall and over to the Gryffindor table, and half-squashed by people who want to sit next to him and think if they move in closer they can grind Ron and Hermione into dust and achieve their aims.
	Hermione’s eyes jolt up.
	All Hermione knew was the bland taste of saliva and breathlessness as she was literally unable to breathe.
	Fuck, Hermione!
	Hermione gasped.
	"Because it was perfect," Hermione replied, lowering her wand.
	Dumbledore still had yet to address her directly but Hermione could feel the anger practically rolling off him and she wasn't ashamed to admit that it scared her.
	Bellatrix isn’t back by teatime, but neither is Hermione.
	Hermione’s stomach did a flip.
	"You all right, Hermione?"
	Hermione couldn’t risk him blowing their future cases on some technicality.
	“He didn’t kill them,” Hermione exhaled her relief.
	"One too many Bludgers to the head, Granger."
	“I mean, there’s me and Hermione, you know?” “No, perhaps Harry’s right, Ron,” Hermione says, but Harry can tell her heart isn’t in it.
	This was spoken in the same tone Ron had used in fourth year when he'd said, Hermione, you're a girl, as if it was brand new information.
	“I’m being facetious, Granger.
	Hermione was struck.
	Hermione raised her hand.
	Hermione took her place at the Head Table.
	What is it?” Hermione Granger replies.
	Hermione grew quiet before asking one last thing.
	At the reassurance of Hermione's touch, Tom turned back to Pansy, glaring.
	Hermione fucking Granger!
	“Yeah,” Hermione smiled, dreamily.
	"He isn't here baby," Hermione said softly, watching as her daughter craned her neck, the infant's silver-grey eyes searching every inch of the sitting room anyway.
	So, Hermione was hardly surprised when, after being (allegedly) asked out on a date by the notorious Abraxas Malfoy, she should find herself in one of Hepzibah’s many favorite clothing boutiques.
	Finally spent and emotionally exhausted, Hermione collapsed against him, her cheek sagging heavily against his chest, her limbs aching.
	"Well, well, Draco Malfoy," Hermione murmured to herself, "you've just added yourself to my list of suspects."
	“Fine,” Bellatrix said, grabbing Hermione’s hands as she tried to poke the older witch again.
	“So sorry we are late,” Ginny apologised, hugging Hermione and passing her the wine.
	Granger pouted.
	A cold wind swept through Hermione's lungs.
	Hermione hadn’t seen it before — she had been too alarmed at the discovery of the Virility Potion to take a quick peek.
	Hermione keeps smiling.
	“You’ve no doubt heard of my many other names, several of which are: He-who-shall-not-be-named, You-know-who, The Dark Lord and finally, Lord Voldemort.” Hermione’s eyes widened, she’d suspected that “Tom” was actually Voldemort, but something just didn’t add up.
	Hermione fell to her knees in front of the floo, her hand pressed against the wood leaving a bloody handprint as she tried to muster more strength to keep from fainting.
	Hermione tore her eyes away and stared at her lap, pressing her lips closed.
	There was something that was calling to Hermione to heal.
	Hermione took a seat across from the desk as Fabian took a seat next to her, their attention turned to Professor Dumbledore as he spoke.
	Hermione glances at Harry and Ron, still stood at the bottom of the stairs.
	Hermione's POV: If she was in a mood to be glib about it, Hermione would have called the past several days something along the lines of her 'not good very bad week'.
	Hermione took it in her palm and stared down at it.
	A witch thirty feet away from Hermione was hit by a purple curse and fell.
	Hermione pushed at the blank space in her memory.
	Hermione said brightly.
	Hermione takes a seat next to Fleur, forever grateful that Ginny and Viktor sit down on her other side so that Madame Maxime is very far away.
	"I love you, Granger."
	Hermione and Alex looked thoughtful for a moment.
	He stopped behind Hermione's chair, his hand on her shoulder.
	Hermione worked silently, her eyes sweeping frequently over to the opening of the tent, looking for Harry.
	Hermione stepped in front of him, though, before he could go anywhere.
	Or, at least, Andie presumed that Hermione was doing the same.
	Since then, Hermione has forced them both into a shower.
	Hermione blushed lightly remembering how she'd escaped up to her room to spend time alone earlier.
	Hermione touched the necklace she wore.
	"Fred, this is huge," Hermione said, walking down the hall to the Master Suite.
	"No," Hermione lowered her voice, aware that Mrs Weasley was not that far away.
	Hermione took the sugar quill out of her mouth and blew out a heavy breath.
	He was sent to retrieve Miss Granger like he was some house-elf for Albus.
	Her anger gave her the focus Hermione lacked and, though she feared it greatly, refused to leave her behind all alone.
	The girl who resembled Parkinson stuck her lower lip out, then shot Hermione a venomous look.
	“Hermione, you stupid— don’t let them touch you!
	"I think this is probably a good moment to remind you of our previous conversation and that I have offered both Harry and Hermione a position here at Hogwarts going forward."
	"You don't hate her," not-Granger corrected.
	Harry keeps hold of Hermione's hand as they walk across the office.
	She giggled, and turned back to Hermione.
	Hermione tugged on her bag strap impatiently.
	It couldn't be denied that the child in Hermione's arms was absolutely stunning.
	[Gratuitous close-up of Draco's hand as it slips conspicuously from Hermione's waist to her lower back.]
	He had to agree with Hermione; the security was appalling even if it was making their lives easier.
	"Story doesn't end there," chuckled Hermione.
	Remembering the last time she had seen him, Hermione couldn’t contain the giggle that overcame her.
	said Hermione.
	They look like old friends to Hermione’s slightly tipsy eyes.
	It's a damn shame I don't know French, Hermione thought humorlessly.
	"Hello," Hermione said softly.
	"A self-fulfilling prophecy sounds really, really lame," Hermione replied.
	Hermione wipes at her face again.
	"I took it in school," Hermione said, which Tom could see was information that appeared to confirm Theo's suspicions.
	“Grang—Hermione, I don’t need you to babysit me.” His voice was plaintive.
	Hermione ignores him, closing her eyes and gritting her teeth.
	Hermione rolled her eyes and drank deeply from her glass.
	Hermione squinted the next morning and found Ron standing over her, flanked by Ginny, Neville, Dean, Seamus, Lavender, Parvati, Padma, Fred and Angelina.
	Hermione smiled and pursed her lips, managing a small nod.
	Hermione stared at Draco as he watched his aunt, his head tilted, his arms hanging at his sides.
	Feeling somewhat smug that she had gotten him to resort to vanishing again--and knowing that it couldn’t have felt pleasant, considering how many times they’d just done that--Hermione nonetheless turned, vigilant and wary.
	Grinning down at the cats on her lap, Hermione nodded.
	Tom eventually managed to wrestle Hermione off from where she'd been clinging to him, shoving her roughly to the mattress and pinning her down by a hand around her throat.
	That wasn't what she had meant, Hermione fumed silently.
	He also likes it when Hermione and Ron come over for dinner, and when Blaise makes the time to floo-call him.
	Are there any… contingencies?” The way he asked, Hermione could tell that Mockridge understood that it was Draco’s inheritance.
	And they did, together, Patience with a joyful shout and Hermione with a bitten lip and a low, sustained moan of pleasure, their arms and legs wrapped around each other, somehow managing to work the words of the spell into their orgasms.
	Taking out a bag, she threw it to Hermione.
	Hermione takes her sandwich over to the table.
	The grin on her face showed Hermione was she was quite enjoying herself, and apparently tormenting an expy of Rodolphus Lestrange was quite a bit therapeutic.
	Steeling herself, Hermione went to answer her call.
	Hermione pulsed magic into the ritual circle.
	Hermione sighed, placing a piece in to the puzzle.
	On the accompanying page, Hermione saw a picture of her posing in front of Draco’s window, and she recognized the moment when Draco had walked in the room and they had made eye contact.
	Burning gold accumulating in the masses, burning through trousers—Hermione didn't have trousers, she was in that bloody dress.
	"Sounds great," Hermione smiled.
	He stuck out his hand, offering it to Hermione.
	Hermione ran her fingers into his hair and cradled him to her.
	Hermione could have jumped in front of the Knight Bus right then and there.
	Hermione could tell he still couldn’t see reliably.
	Hermione pulled a face at the name and the accompanying flash of hatred it brought with it.
	And Harry was pushing himself away from the table where he’d slumped, looking at Hermione and Draco’s pale faces.
	Hermione froze for a few seconds, then decided to grant her own wish.
	Hermione scoffs.
	That was the first thing Hermione thought to herself when she finally awoke after the chaos that had occurred just the day before.
	Hermione stirred slightly at the mention of Harry.
	Hermione nodded and stared across the room at the dark form of Professor Snape conferring with Dumbledore and McGonagall in the doorway.
	“T-thank you, Madam,” Hermione said, her breath still hitching slightly from crying.
	And I promise," he said, lacing his fingers blindly with Theo's, "there is peace eventually, Hermione.
	“Hermione… my little Lynx…” she murmured into Hermione’s hair.
	Hermione’s eyes immediately locked onto the headlines she could make out.
	H - MAAN House Slytherin will make all reasonable effort to secure places for all eligible children of House Granger at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
	"Well gee, Granger, when I was allowed to examine it, my findings were inconclusive—" Hermione turned to her, tugging her curls away from Pansy's fingertips.
	Then, he pushed deeper into his soul mate bond with Hermione.
	"Ron's a mindless git, Hermione."
	McGonagall continued, “However for saving Miss Granger and demonstrating what I understand to have been remarkable self-restraint, and then helping to bring a quick resolution to an extremely unfortunate situation in the hallway, I award eighty points to Slytherin.
	Hermione closed her eyes and scoffed before glaring at him.
	Hermione swore, digging her fingers into the duvet.
	"I wasn't aware that you were able to ask questions of any other kind, Granger."
	“Did he?” Hermione snaps.
	Parvati is at her best friend's side in an instant but Hermione— Hermione's stomach drops.
	Hermione could just hover there and see Malfoy with a hand outstretched, now just teaching air, frantically calling for a friend that was no longer there.
	"About time you got up, dinner's going to go cold," Hermione smiled as she walked over and kissed them both on the cheek.
	They shake hands and Hermione says her own thanks before Ariana steps back into the castle.
	“Ron, you should take better care of your wand,” said Hermione, and Fred grinned.
	Then Hermione looked up, and she gasped.
	Miss Hermione Granger First Bedroom on the Second Floor 146 Vulpe Drive  London, England  Dear Miss Granger, An hour later, Richard and Helen Granger were visibly much calmer as they asked Minerva McGonagall as many questions as possible.
	"Anyway, I'll let you be," Granger said, cancelling her Muffliato.
	Sirius suspected that his dismissal of the French girl's action was partly to reassure Hermione that she was still the one he wanted to ask out.
	When the woman made her way past them to greet another newcomer, Hermione and Millie made eye contact.
	A shot pop and they were gone, only Hermione knowing they were headed straight into their longest night.
	Hermione bit his lip and ground down against him feeling his erection notch perfectly against her core.
	How is Hermione her mate?
	Hermione climbs up on the bed so she can talk to Andy in the chaos, carefully avoiding stepping on Bella or Teddy.
	Hermione grins.
	Hermione, think.
	"She's over there," she added neutrally, gesturing to where Hermione was staring with confusion at a bright pink drink she'd just been handed in a champagne flute.
	Hermione's gown: https://cache.net-a-porter.com/images/products/178764/178764_in_xl.jpg  Thirty minutes later, Hermione sat across from her husband in their carriage, neither of them making eye contact.
	The arrival of the rest of the class distracted the woman away from them, and he and Hermione crossed over to their housemates, ready for class to begin.
	Tom said, interrupting whatever Hermione's thought had been.
	Harry and Ron freaked and wanted to start a search.”  “Someone must have tried to use some dark curse that backfired,” Hermione said, pulling out her kit and handing Fred a restorative and a vial of pain relief.
	Hermione: "I asked you to come to my desk!"
	Mrs. Weasley only scoffs, moving on to fuss over Harry and leaving Hermione staring at Ron.
	Puts the apple down on her table and looks at Hermione.
	The wave of nausea that Hermione had forced away came rushing back.
	Hermione blinked, about to ask who they were when the woman turned toward her, and Hermione was staring at the face of her mother.
	Hermione stood between his feet and pushed his hand away.
	There’s certainly nothing wrong with that, Granger.” “Damn, Granger.
	"I saw the way he was talking to you after the funeral Hermione," Fred argued, his arms folded.
	Well, I believe in you, Hermione.
	Hermione ran into a few of them in passing, but as she would come to find, the brief encounters they shared were more valuable to her than few other things in this world.
	No matter how much I want to, it won’t let me kill you.” She gave Hermione a far too sweet smile.
	Hermione casts a sonorus.
	"Yes," Hermione closed her eyes and smiled.
	His whole being centres on Hermione; on the feel of her lips beneath his, the touch of her skin under his fingers as he cups her cheek with his free hand, the knowledge that her hand is fisted in his shirt, warmth creeping into his belly as the kiss deepens a touch.
	He sighed as Ron and Hermione shuffled closer to lean against Greg as well.
	Hermione makes shocked eye contact with Bellatrix.
	“Harry… That’s not at all what-” Hermione tried to reason with him, but was cut off once again.
	After that, they were really friends, especially Hermione and Ron.
	Harry also wanted to lead an assault on Malfoy Manor, which met with equal parts disbelief and anger from both Ron and Hermione.
	Hermione's hands felt clammy.
	Hermione, who was supposed to be home by now.
	Taking the familiar route to the Rose Room, Hermione waved at the portraits that greeted her with a spring in her step.
	He sticks a hand out and Hermione shakes it.
	"It shouldn't be for long," Hermione said.
	Hermione blinked at her own volume and consciously lowered her voice.
	“I, Severus Tobias Snape, do promise myself in matrimony to you, Hermione Jean Granger.
	Hermione trailed off, thinking.
	Hermione sighed in understanding.
	Hermione has the bizarre thought of feeling like a cross between Cinderella and a small child.
	Once the door was closed, Hermione stood for several seconds, staring at it, never wanting to open it again.
	Hermione sighed.
	Hermione saw her standing beside a penseive; it’s previous owner’s portrait hanging above, seeming to be in a deep slumber.
	Nudging his elbow with hers, Granger grinned.
	"You look beautiful, Lily," Hermione said honestly.
	Hermione watched with a sense of detachment, but when she looked over at Ron and Harry, she saw their eyes were glazed over and both had sappy looks on their faces.
	Hermione shook her head.
	“No apology required,” Hermione said.
	“I can’t even imagine growing up with family like that,” Hermione said carefully.
	Hermione bit her lip.
	That made him wonder if Granger might relieve Lucius in more ways than one.
	Hermione bit the inside of her lip.
	Hermione gave another dry laugh.
	It had been so long since she heard such praise and encouragement that Hermione found her face burning from both pride and embarrassment.
	During the day he was detached in a way Hermione didn’t know how to be.
	Hermione whimpered ever so softly, but Harry heard it, and judging by the way Ginny’s eye’s dilated, she sure as hell heard it too.
	asked Hermione.
	Whispered Bellatrix, keeping her eyes on him and her hand gripping Hermione, breaking skin.
	His eyes darted quickly from Hermione to Lucius.
	“How often do you come here?” Hermione asked.
	Hermione listened with rapt attention.
	“You’re an adult, Miss Granger,” McGonagall said, surveying the mountain of scrolls between them.
	Hermione stops in her rant as Bellatrix raises an eyebrow at her.
	"Miss Granger," Lucius called out from inside the room.
	She appreciated it, sure, but Hermione had never seen a magical painting that made her stop and think, wow.
	With McGonagall at the head of the formation, Bellatrix knew she could relax: they would reach Hermione long before they would.
	Hermione wrinkled her nose.
	Hermione eyed him.
	Hermione, as should have been entirely predictable, had a series of hysterical meltdowns about her class syllabi and she just wasn’t ready to be a teacher and what if she was terrible at it!
	Hold on, Hermione,” she mouthed the words over and over.
	Tom jerked, like a frightened horse, but Hermione held tight to his arm, her fingers caressing the words in a soothing motion.
	Hermione fights for breath and her knees almost buckle as an unbearable pain slams into her chest.
	Bellatrix looks at Hermione’s wand in confusion.
	Hermione grabs Bellatrix’s frozen arm and pictures somewhere safe.
	Hermione felt a sense of cold slide through her spine.
	As they finished up dinner, Hermione’s brain slipped to Bellatrix again.
	Hermione muttered a spell and pressed the tip of her wand against the lighting bolt scar slicing through his forehead.
	On the south side of Gairsay Island, at the bottom of the hill, deep under Granger Cottage, in a hollowed out cavern dipping into the waters of the North Sea, the adult Grangers were just putting the finishing touches on their full-scale submarine model.
	Hermione chuckled.
	Between holiday and ball preparations, Hermione had been kept busy, and she suspected that Narcissa had done that on purpose, taking her shopping with Felicity, and sending both of them to muggle London with Galatea to get a few small gifts for Felicity’s family.
	Hermione asked.
	And Hermione had stolen that chance from her.
	After another twenty minutes of doing nothing but lying beside Malfoy while he remained in his potion-induced slumber, Hermione grew drowsy.
	A rumble shook the sand and Hermione turned just in time to look over her shoulder and see the seaweeds moving erratically as whatever was following them stopped circling and seemed to head straight for them.
	"Hm," said Hermione.
	"There are very few people that I care for in this world, Hermione.
	Hermione gasped as she felt a desolation in the very pit of her soul — as if something primal to her very being was being taken from her.
	Hermione, breaking away: "What the hell was that?"
	Hermione, Theo noticed, shrank back from Sirius' touch, panicked.
	They sat curled together for a few minutes before Hermione’s dread returned.
	Hermione was on the floor, unconscious and bleeding.
	"Uhm," Hermione looked away.
	Hermione had a hard time ripping her eyes away from the enigmatic man, but did so that she could take in the woman beside him.
	Along the way Hermione looked over at Draco.
	Hermione screamed as her entire body tilted to the left and she began falling over the left side.
	Bellatrix let out a short whine and took a small step, wanting to go after Hermione but stopped herself.
	Hermione was able to sneak upstairs, change out of her ruined dress (she shoved it and her two left shoes as far back in her closet as she could, where they would remain untouched forevermore) and into her nightgown, let her hair down, and only then did she go back downstairs to gently awaken her aunt.
	She wore a black dress with trainers, her hair only a bit longer since Hermione had seen it last.
	Hermione just watches in confusion.
	‘Here you are, Miss Granger.
	Hermione smirked at him.
	Granger scoffed.
	Hermione swallowed, glancing over at where Draco still stood silently near the door.
	Hermione leans to whisper.
	“Do you know the words?” Hermione whispers back, not daring to believe.
	Tom was surprised and annoyed when he learned that Hermione had called a group meeting in the Chamber for the Friday night before the Malfoy ball.
	Despite this, she had many fears for Tom’s future, concerns that were born out of the deep knowledge of what he was capable of becoming if he lost the connections with humanity Hermione, Abraxas, Patience had spent six years forging.
	"An hour," Hermione sighed sadly.
	Hermione felt Draco moving behind her, but after Severus got his arm back around him, they both went still.
	Robards told them there's nothing to worry about, that most of the Death Eaters will lose interest as soon as they see their destination is nothing but an old hovel, and while Hermione appeared worried, both Harry and Ron were itching to do something.
	"Hermione didn't mean we'd never stay here again," Harry tried reassuring Draco as Neville watched on with wide-eyes, seeming bewildered by Draco's whining – she realised that seeing the Malfoy heir without his usual haughty and somewhat cruel Pureblood demeanour must still be a bit of a shock to the Gryffindor.
	"That's what I said," Daphne agreed, striding over to stand beside Hermione.
	Hermione began to panic again as she realized that she was definitely out of time to get to St. Mungo's.
	“That, my dear Miss Granger, is an excellent argument and something I will have to think on further.” “May I buy you another drink, my dear?” Hermione glanced at him and their eyes locked.
	Hermione sighs, but turns over in her sleeping bag so she's lying on her back.
	Hermione snickered under her breath and fingered one orange rose petal.
	How could Hermione walk Harry, who was in all effect her best friend and her brother, to the grave?
	She said it fondly, but it still reminded Hermione that Bellatrix had suffered this evening.
	Hermione felt heat emanating from her cheeks while Bellatrix smirked briefly.
	Emotions like fear or joy or- now that her eyes have been opened, desperation- were not something she could freely show like Hermione.
	Hermione said her goodbyes and left with Andromeda.
	Hermione: [defensively] "Well, it's been a very challenging day, what with Ron - " [She stops, raising her voice as the noises grow louder.]
	When he lifted his head, Hermione moved off him.
	He needed to tell Hermione about that.
	Hermione: "What?
	“We need to secure the perimeter before we do anything else,” Hermione said.
	Hermione’s voice echoes in the silence.
	Hermione squeaked.
	Backing up, Hermione wiped the sweat from her forehead.
	Hermione was confused.
	Are you not having sex with Hermione either?
	Celestina Warbeck was holding court at one corner table, four of the Montrose Magpies were at a table near the door, and he and Hermione had taken a booth that was in the direct eyeline of everyone that walked past the restaurant.
	“I don’t seem to mind it from you,” Bellatrix replied, looking down at their joined hands before squeezing Hermione’s gently.
	Harry sighed and conceded to that point and Sunday afternoon he found himself sitting in Hagrid's cabin which felt even warmer then usual and watched Hermione flatter Hagrid while learning interesting facts about Magical Creatures– well, she claimed they were interesting facts anyway.
	You must mean second year on the Quidditch pitch when he called me a Mudblood,” Hermione said with a neutral face.
	Hermione countered.
	When they entered the room, Hermione’s senses were assaulted by the intermingled smells of fear, potions, blood and sweat.
	Hermione touched the scar on the side of his neck.
	"Isn't Hermione the obvious choice?"
	As soon as they were done he stalked away and left Hermione nearly incoherent in the cloud of his pheromones.
	Hermione cast her eyes downward.
	Hermione started and stared at Ginny.
	So, there's no Hermione or Tom in this chapter - I got sidetracked by Galatea and Narcissa - I'm falling in love with those two.
	Hermione could sense neither dread nor lust in them.
	"Let me see the book," Hermione said, voice too loud for the quiet room.
	Hermione glanced at Luna, but she was staring dreamily at the ceiling.
	Pansy was always the one chatting and gossiping about old friends, so when Tracey played music from her wand, Hermione resolved to remain quiet for the afternoon.
	Daphne climbed into a trunk, which Hermione then shrunk and pocketed.
	Hermione was pretty sure he was part of an old pureblood family.
	Sirius had chosen to sit right next to Hermione, in flagrant defiance of the carefully set places that Regulus had painstakingly laid out.
	Hermione felt her body urging her to relax into the familiar comfort of it, but she resisted.
	Somehow, Hermione had healed her and sent his tattered soul back to him, he could feel it.
	Who killed Ron before Hermione's eyes, laughing the entire time.
	He gently removed Hermione from his chest and pressed her head over onto her pillow and slid out of the bed.
	Mister Granger knew who she was, but didn't know who Mister Buccaneer, AKA Fred Weasley, was.
	“Oh no,” Hermione said.
	Hermione’s eyes narrowed as she appraised him.
	Hermione laughed and kissed his neck.
	We’ll see Hermione later.
	Hermione shuddered and obeyed, her orgasm silent as she fell limp, her body fully supported by her wrists.
	"Wotcher, Hermione," Harry said with a smirk, mimicking Tonks as he jumped around the corner.
	[Cuts back to Ron and Hermione.]
	"That makes one of us," Hermione shrugged, "Professor, what if I mess it up?
	"Listen," Granger said, nodding her head towards the door.
	There are words withheld in the distance between his outstretched hand and his tongue, but Granger still smiles slightly and takes her book back.
	Hermione lifted her brows.
	Hermione watched as Ron’s eyes rested on those mints for a second too long.
	Hermione smiles up at her.
	Back in the room, Severus warded the door behind him, and he noticed immediately that Hermione had found a suitable workstation.
	“Granger!”  Startled, Hermione looked down.
	Hermione had to laugh at deer in headlight's look on Harry's face as his eyes flew open in horror.
	“What is it?” Hermione said, not sure if she should open the paper here.
	Hermione got to see her face for the first time.
	As the pleasure subsided, the magic rose, and Abraxas could feel his connection to Hermione, to Tom, to Patience, and all the interconnections, an extension of his own magical field.
	Hermione smiled to herself.
	Hermione sat on her bed while Molly cleaned her arm and rubbed a salve over the wounds.
	The fire was dying and Hermione was full and content.
	Harry let Katie and Hermione lead him to the hospital wing, while a fuming Ginny trudged over to Filch’s office.
	Hermione had seen Bellatrix do this before when Mr Weasley returned from work.
	Hermione's spell hit the rock and did nothing.
	“Hermione Granger.” “Hermione Granger, Minister of Magic.
	Bellatrix turned, still clutching Hermione by the hair, as did Mott, and both came to see the dark-eyes wizard who had just appeared in the middle of the standing stones.
	Tom asked, and Hermione, relieved that someone actually believed her, had told him the truth: she could unlock doors.
	Hermione: "OH SHOVE IT, MALFOY, YOU BRUTISHLY HANDSOME DEVIANT!"
	Hermione released the small sigh of relief.
	Harry Potter with friends Ron Weasley (See: Weasley, Ron, chapter 7) and Muggle-born witch, Hermione Granger.
	"You're lucky I've got this bag," Hermione scoffed, sitting down at his bedside and pulling out a tin holding some Shepard's Pie she had knicked on her way up here from the kitchens.
	"Yes, yes, I'm familiar with our excuse for a moral code," Hermione snapped, though she'd already gone ahead and defied what remained of it anyway.
	I've included Miss Granger's booklist and Hogsmeade form in here as I have no doubt that unlike the rest of us you'll be able to contact her.
	Hermione felt a strong tug of desire in her low belly, a tightening in her nipples, and she had to bite her lower lip so as to not give away the wave of stimulation his deep voice was provoking in her body.
	Hermione twisted around and felt all around Draco’s chest and face, searching for his mouth in the dark.
	Hermione rubbed the remaining cream into her skin and then sniffed her hands.
	Hermione shook her head.
	My — my Occlumency's gotten a little better —" Harry cuts off as Hermione's hand lands on his knee and she turns in her chair to face him.
	Hermione collapses to the floor, but she keeps her eyes up until she sees Arthur and Fred enter the room, until she sees them both in one piece.
	It was a shame that Mistress and Miss Hermione didn’t know how to get along.
	Smiling, Hermione let her head fall back, exposing her chest fully.
	"Hermione," Draco said, lifting a brow in surprise.
	Hermione was sure she heard the wood door open and close, but Harry waited ten seconds more.
	Hermione fussed with the sugar packets in their holder, straightening out their edges.
	"So," asked Hermione, keeping her voice low.
	Hermione's hands shook, but she maintained as composed an expression as she could manage.
	“Are you sure?” To this point, Bellatrix had carefully avoided being in any pictures that would be published and had only allowed Hermione to mention her as her travel companion twice; once in the first piece and once for a particularly funny tale in which a Niffler had managed to get into their tent during the night and gone to sleep in Bellatrix’s curls, much to Hermione’s amusement in the morning.
	Yes, Tom might be the leader of their group in name, but Hermione held everyone together.
	Hermione looked over at Severus, her heart pounding heavily in her chest.
	Hermione exclaimed and shifted away from Bellatrix, all sense of romance now completely ebbed away.
	Hermione felt a thrill of anticipation as they drew near to the drawing room, where she could hear giggling followed by a familiar, smooth voice.
	Hermione lifted herself up and lurched towards him, letting out a weird laugh.
	Hermione's hair was a cloud, Luna's a slant of moonlight, Neville's earth.
	I think you should begin to understand what I expect from you, Hermione.”  Hermione gulped nervously, and turned back to the book.
	"We don't know she was the one who did that to Wood," Severus rolled his eyes- really, everyone knew Granger had done that to the fourth year, "and what she did to Weasley counts as self-defense.
	Hermione sighs.
	Hermione felt her blood run cold.
	Hermione clenches her jaw…and slowly points her wand at Narcissa.
	"Hermione—!"
	Hermione's eyes found Boris and she when she saw that he was chasing after the Snitch, she breathed a sigh of relief; Regulus wasn't even trying to find the Snitch.
	That earned a yelp from Harry, heard even through Hermione’s lips and tongue.
	Hermione, Daphne, and Ginny all watched them with different levels of owlishness.
	“Come on,” Hermione said, and walked over to the patchy grass in the centre of the square.
	Hermione wondered what had happened to Umbridge to make her as sadistic as she was.
	“I wouldn’t, I just couldn’t live in Malfoy Manor, especially not with Gawain and Evangeline.” Hermione’s fingers were entwined with his, their magic thrumming between their joined hands.
	Hermione even enjoyed it for the most part.
	Hermione’s eyes rolled back in pleasure as Remus’ thick cock pushed deeper inside her.
	Slowly stands up and wraps her arms around Hermione.
	Hermione had her there.
	And she walks Hermione out of the room, grip tight.
	We can tell him Monday, I promise.” Hermione bargained.
	Malfoy’s expression grew distinctly cagey, and Hermione took it to be a good sign.
	He’d nearly bitten her head off the last time she tried to heal him, so Hermione attempted to ignore it.
	Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at the sight with their jaws dropped.
	“Afraid that you’ll lose.” Hermione fired back.
	“She’s not my girlfriend,” Hermione rolled her eyes but couldn’t help the smile that crept onto her lips.
	Hermione looked to her.
	“It’s fine, Granger.
	Severus glanced up from his book to watch Hermione read.
	"Merry Christmas, Hermione," they both said, giving her a big grin each.
	I am going to use it!” Hermione yelled.
	Hermione’s hand went unconsciously to her neck, where she knew they started, but as she looked down a feeling of horror began to take hold.
	His gaze slid up to Hermione and he winked at her.
	Oh, he's good, Hermione thought as Abraxas gave her a charming smile.
	He looked around the table, from Demelza who looked back at him with a loving, devoted gaze, to Luna, who was praising Susan’s article, to Katie, who was teasing Ginny for being ‘whipped’, to Hermione, who gave him a quick kiss goodbye before she left, and then to Fleur, who was looking at him with an intense, loving expression that had him looking forward to when they’d get to – how had Ginny put it?
	Hermione stared at the emerald eye for several long moments before slowly turning and trudging back to her room.
	Harry and Hermione follow her.
	“Never did have the pleasure of being your professor, Miss Granger,” Moody growled from his seat in front of the desk.
	Hermione had been confused for a moment, wondering what Draco had in mind when his face shifted and his voice went cold, then he claimed she was pregnant and she understood.
	Hermione smiled and lay a hand on her shoulder.
	When Remus’ cock slowly shrank, Harry helped Hermione off of him, and pulled her into his lap.
	They're so in sync — Hermione, Harry, Daphne, even Luna.
	Hermione looked up at Bellatrix’s face and saw that her eyes were a little watery.
	“Listen to this: The love between young Draco Malfoy and Ms. Granger is palpable.
	“Please let me go,” Hermione whimpered, a wave of nausea rushing over her.
	Snape drawled but Hermione shook her head.
	In just a few months Hermione was primed to become a full-fledged godmother, and ever since Harry and Ginny had favored her with the title, she’d been imagining herself flouncing about in pastel robes and waving her wand like a demented Disney character.
	Hermione folds her arms.
	Hermione shook it.
	Hermione will still be… Hermione curls sideways.
	Hermione kept her eyes on the ground.
	Hermione laughs.
	Hermione yelped at the hit and clenched her eyes shut.
	He bowed his head, but Hermione defiantly stared the Dark Lord in the eye, the darkness drawing her in.
	“I’ll sort it out, Hermione.
	“Can I see?” asked Hermione, and the photos were dutifully shared around.
	"He's a good Alpha," Hermione said, smiling slightly.
	Theo held back a laugh at the look on Draco's face as Blaise took off, straightening his tie and proceeding straight for the table with Granger and Weasley.
	Hermione froze.
	That was for being rude.” Hermione moved to the left side of the room across from Bellatrix.
	Hermione asked, pointedly batting her lashes at him.
	Hermione grinned, accepting his arm by threading her own around it.
	“Thank Merlin for Oliver Wood!” Hermione grabbed a handful of popcorn, and Katie laughed, wiggling her eyebrows.
	"Miss Granger,"—Harry brought her attention back to him—"Do you ever find strange things happening around you?"
	It didn’t take long for him to slip it inside and press it causing Hermione to hiss and mewl under their mutual attention.
	So far Hermione seemed fine.
	After setting the Horcrux on the ground in front of her, Hermione reached an empty hand out to him, silently requesting the sword.
	Hermione’s cheeks flushed and she bit her lip.
	Hermione: [exasperatedly] "MALFOY!"
	Lucius pushed his own mind to the very delicate outer limits of Hermione’s once more, but drew back immediately upon sensing her profound, palpable suffering.
	Hermione has to put her pride aside.
	Hermione felt something in her stomach drop sharply at the thought of experiencing another heat.
	Hermione knows maybe Lavender is just over excited, or maybe even Parvati has found her, but all she can think about is the dozens of times that giggle has been directed at her and— Hermione yells, sliding her fingers into her hair and tugs, trying to ground herself before she flies off the handle completely.
	They're in Fred and George's room—though Hermione is meant to be out keeping Ginny company while she flies, and Fred is meant to be in Diagon Alley with George.
	Hermione’s hips jumped and Bellatrix chuckled again, pressing her into the table further.
	Hermione glanced up to see the woman and her playful expression peeking out onto the path.
	"Granger?!"
	“But what are you going to do with it once it’s hatched?” asked Hermione.
	Hermione folds her arms.
	Harry tensed and tried to roll away when Tom reached down where he was sensitive and aching but Hermione held him in place as Tom gripped onto him, jerking roughly.
	Hermione sighs.
	Who are you and what have you done with Hermione?” Hermione rolled her eyes and laughed with Ginny.
	Granger stared at him doubtfully.
	“We are not having dinosaurs in the flat, unless you’re moving out,” Hermione announced, accepting the freshly prepared mug of coffee from Sirius with a smile.
	Her tongue darted out and she wet Hermione’s lip before kissing her gently.
	"Hermione's going to kill someone.
	Hermione in uniform by graciek_217 Hermione reappeared in a dark foyer.
	And maybe—someday I can learn to trust you again," Hermione said hoping that her crossed fingers could serve as a signal to the universe that she was in desperate, dyer, emergency need of help.
	“Because of the thread…” Hermione whispers.
	“Hermione—please—” Hermione seemed rather certain of it.
	Riddle glanced quickly from Hermione and Hepzibah and back again.
	He couldn’t help but notice how the males in the Great Hall and even a few females kept sending Granger appreciative looks, they made him want to hex their eyes out.
	His hand wrapped around hers, and Hermione smiled as a snuggly stream of warmth trickled through her stomach.
	He dug his thumb into the top of her calf, just behind the bend in her knee and Hermione groaned helplessly.
	Hermione had drawn sharp breaths to explain why she wanted to omit it from Blaise's defense, and how Blaise had agreed.
	“Why would Hepzibah do that?” Hermione asked.
	Hermione's pulse raced again, her eyes widening as she saw Draco's face.
	Hermione imagined that he would, probably under the guise that he was there on Borgin and Burke’s business.
	When they got to Ginny's room, Hermione paused outside the door and watched as Bellatrix headed towards the bathroom.
	Hermione stepped into a dimly lit room filled with cozy fireplaces and low-lit sconces.
	Hermione didn’t get riled up from the rudeness being thrown her way.
	Because as he looks at Hermione Granger, instead of seeing the bushy hair and the infuriating attitude, he sees a young woman who is intelligent and strong and fierce.
	Hermione turned the clock around and found a small inscription which Bellatrix apparently had made with her wand before putting the clock in the knothole.
	"Well at least you were decent," Hermione grinned, quickly scanning the dress that the older woman was wearing.
	I’m Hermione.” She shook his hand and gave him a pointed look.
	Hermione continued towards Draco, feeling Astoria’s eyes on her back.
	Previously: Hermione did her best to conceal her shock.
	"Oh I'm in," Skeeter replied, her answering smile nasty and her eyes gleaming in a way that reminded Hermione of a Great White shark circling its prey; hunting, assessing, anticipatory and hungry.
	“I didn’t mean it.” He did, though, a bit, and he thinks Hermione can tell that.
	Hermione didn’t know if he was averse to snogging or if he just thought she wasn’t up for it.
	Hermione sighed in exasperation.
	Hermione made a mental note to find a photograph to be sure.
	Hermione never forgot anything.
	Hermione stared down at her nails and fidgeted with the cuticles for a minute.
	He'd found out the night before that all the women who'd taken part in the ritual had seen events through Hermione's eyes so he knew she knew just how bad Harry had been; how broken he'd looked as Sirius had held him as though he was the most precious thing in the world.
	Hermione said, reaching over to tap the white bandage wrapped around Draco's forearm.
	Hermione shook her head.
	Hermione took a deep breath.
	It was Hermione who always tried to talk them out of doing reckless things.
	Harry wasn't sure when she'd pulled out one of her switchblades, but as Hermione stepped even closer to his uncle he saw the flash of silver in her hand as she pressed the edge of the wickedly sharp blade to Vernon's throat.
	"I am Hermione Granger, of the House of Granger, vassal of the Most Ancient and Noble House of Slytherin."
	"Good morning, Mippy," Hermione said, smiling down at her through the tightness in her chest.
	But Hermione wasn’t inclined to be trusting.
	"Well that will no longer happen," Voldemort sounded amused again, much to Hermione's relief.
	"Hey Hermione, be my partner?"
	He subtly licked his lips, and Hermione felt a corresponding tickle over her own mouth.
	Hermione breathed, almost reaching out for him even though he wore another man's face.
	In my experience, Hermione, girls understand a lot better just exactly what other girls like.
	"In case it's escaped your attention, after spending any sort of prolonged time away from Hogwarts you have a tendency to be overly blunt, rude and vulgar," he informed her, and Hermione was surprised when the others all nodded in agreement.
	Hermione shared his excitement, but she did have practical matters to deal with.
	Hermione hugs her arm to her chest.
	Hermione ran her hand down Crookshanks back and glared at the bird who had the gall to try and act innocent- as if she had suddenly forgot that it tried to dive bomb her not even five minutes before.
	Coupled with her generous curves that the robes showcased expertly, Hermione felt a soft pang in her heart at the woman's undeniable beauty.
	It wasn't that the older woman was talking about anything related to it, but Hermione found that they shared a mutual understanding that had allowed.... communication.
	Adding the fact all the witches and wizards present would no doubt be more then happy to turn a runaway Boy-Who-Lived back over to the 'grandfatherly', 'benevolent' and 'understanding' Headmaster of Hogwarts, the one and only Albus Dumbledore, well... Hermione could feel the panic settle in her gut, her heart speeding up as blood rushed in her ears.
	“Results?” Hermione asked, sorting books.
	Harry kept watch on the crowd around the picture who were theorising about why it had fallen off the wall while Hermione looked through the records.
	Hermione was only to happy to cuddle a little longer, pressing her body against Trix'.
	“I will not leave Miss Granger, Headmaster,” he said.
	For a moment, Bellatrix adopted a stony expression, which quickly transformed into a cheeky smirk which seemed to be telling her 'Hermione, I'm absolutely going to kiss you now.'
	Draco Malfoy, my cousin; Hermione Granger, a daughter of the House of Black; Neville Longbottom, my godbrother; Ronald Weasley, my best mate, and Theodore Nott and Blaise Zabini, my classmates at Hogwarts although we're in different Houses."
	Hermione looked up at Snape, who stared through the open door, his face a perfect mask of indifference.
	Hermione looked around for her Patronus, certain that it must have cut a path through the battle once more, but it soared above them, beating its heavy wings against the domed ceiling.
	"All of your students are of age," Harry pointed out, squeezing Hermione's hand gently, not missing the way she'd tensed up when the French headmistress had called the Tournament a chance to die for.
	Hermione thought back to that fateful day, meeting Bellatrix in the strange pool in the wood.
	Hermione studied her grandmother and felt at the very core of her being that she wouldn’t knowingly lead her wrong.
	Hermione feels a rage build within her, a rage that simmers and fades into a cold determination.
	“What did you say to my mother when you were introduced?” Hermione flushed and glared at Draco.
	Hermione twitched.
	"Hermione's my best friend and I don't want to say this.
	Happy Birthday, Hermione.
	Hermione half expected him to walk off again, but he didn’t.
	"Come on, Granger," Flint crooned.
	Hermione whipped around corners until she finally found a reception area with a woman in a white nurses' hat at a desk, ruffling through paperwork.
	“Repair it, Hermione.
	He felt Hermione trembling and sobbing in his arms and he clenched his jaw tight.
	Tom frowned, reluctant to leave Harry, but Hermione was insistent and she gave his hand a sharp tug when he hesitated.
	Take a breath and move past it, Hermione.
	"Generally no," Hermione told him.
	His student looked particularly eye-catching tonight in her white gown, the splashes of crimson and rubies accentuating the dress reminding Severus almost uncannily of blood– and he got the feeling the effect wasn't unintentional; Hermione's sense of humour was an interesting one.
	"If I might speak, Headmaster," said Snape from the shadows, "Mr. Potter and Miss Granger simply appear to have been at the wrong place at the wrong time.
	"Yes, your point, Granger?"
	Hermione turns her head to give him a disbelieving look that he probably can’t see.
	Hermione couldn't rely on maybe in this case.
	“I knew you were jealous about Fleur,” Hermione sighs as Bellatrix does jump on her.
	A minute later she and Granger ducked into an empty bathroom near the third floor.
	Somehow gazing into the void started to make Hermione feel a bit uncomfortable, especially now that she knew it was also below her.
	I want happiness, Hermione.
	"Choose this one for any particular reason, Granger?"
	Hermione observed the wizards sitting around the table, each looking put out by the appearance of the Patronus, Sirius included.
	“I don’t care!” Hermione insisted, holding up her arm.
	he asked her eagerly, careful to keep his voice hushed enough that the noise in the Hall kept anyone but her from hearing and Hermione smiled at him.
	Riddle’s cheeks turned pinker and his smiles came more easily and his cold, seemingly impenetrable walls slowly but surely began to melt in Hermione’s presence.
	“Are you okay, Hermione?” Hermione let out a surprised grunt at the contact and felt her cheeks flame to life, but obediently made her way out of the office.
	Hermione refused to give her what she wanted and kept her eyes on the lifts as they approached.
	“Lying for me, Granger?” he said, raising an eyebrow, his words enunciated with a long, slow drawl.
	"Is she interested in…" Hermione paused.
	Harry turned to Hermione and in a low voice asked, "Are you allowed to tell me what you and Professor Dumbeldore are discussing?"
	Hermione’s throat felt thick, and her eyes burned as she swallowed.
	Hermione nodded slowly.
	Hermione crossed her legs, waiting patiently, as Bellatrix resumed her pacing.
	Hermione bleated in surprise and grabbed hold of Draco’s arm, positive she was going to levitate off the bed.
	Ginny nodded enthusiastically, going on to explain how she and Harry had to wait a few days before they could try again, and when Hermione’s eye twitched involuntarily, Ginny laughed and let her shut the door in her face.
	Hermione’s so close, she just needs—  Hermione…Hermione…Hermione Bellatrix lunges upwards and throws herself at Hermione so that they both tumble onto the bed.
	He’d felt bile rise in his throat when he heard of Molly’s blind insistence that Hermione was now evil incarnate due to her association with him.
	Hermione twisted to look behind her.
	Which Hermione really should have seen coming.
	But since he planned on avoiding Granger till she was willing to be reasonable about their situation, Draco was resisting the urge to go be with his mate.
	Hermione turned her gaze down to look over the beautiful gift.
	No amount of analyzing her pale reflection brought Hermione any closer to enlightenment.
	Hermione's mother snorted in amusement and rolled her eyes.
	After Breakfast Hermione packed her trunk and levitated it behind her to the Rose Room, her wandless magic was coming along nicely.
	Hermione poured Blood-Replenishing Potion and the antidote for the bite down the woman’s throat before trying to quickly diagnose what had happened to Michael.
	Hermione was well aware he was just proving to her she was in for a world of scrumptious hurt when he was her Master.
	"We can make it easier to defeat by confusing it," Hermione said.
	“The hat considered every house except Hufflepuff,” Hermione admitted.
	After both dried their hand, Hermione faced the pool once more.
	Hermione decided she would at least investigate this mystery, but keep a healthy distance for now.
	Hermione blushed and glanced down.
	It was something Hermione had not seen since the Battle of Hogwarts.
	But Lucius, Hermione, and Draco all understood that life could quickly become something never intended.
	It explained why Ginny had seemed defensive when Hermione had tried to bring up the subject of Alphas.
	Harry felt himself smile slightly, despite the gravity of the situation– Hermione keeping a cool head in an 'emergency' and taking charge was so typical of her and no one had even tried to protest.
	"Miss Granger," he says, voice calm.
	“Gak!” Hermione choked.
	"I don't...understand, Hermione," Harry said finally.
	Hermione was done with being surprised that Bellatrix couldn’t be found.
	At noon on the dot, a knock on her office door made Hermione look up from her half-written memo.
	Hermione settled into her seat and took a bottle of butterbeer from Sirius with a nod and a smile before turning back to Harry.
	He looked directly into her eyes and said, “You’ll make a fine Lady Malfoy for him, Miss Granger.” “You know, Miss Granger,” he said, looking to the window on his left.
	Hermione could tell that the conversation was something that had occurred more than once.
	Hermione wondered what on earth it could be.
	It didn’t take long before Hermione and Draco were teasing each other with tales from Hogwarts.
	"Hermione," Remus clarified again.
	Narcissa Malfoy pressed her lips together, looking out past the hedges, and Hermione felt a cold wind inside of her, settling around her ribs.
	Hermione raises an eyebrow.
	Granger looked up, meeting Daphne's eye.
	Images from the last hour are dancing behind his eyelids — Umbridge's outraged expression before being stunned — the screams of muggleborns and halfbloods as they were chased by an endless number of dementors — hundreds of fliers with his own face plastered on the front, blocking his vision — Hermione's hand reaching for his and Ron's as they vaulted into the Floo Network.
	She and Leanne are crying, calling out her name and asking her to look at them, telling her "it's us, it's Hermione, it's Leanne, your friends—we're your friends, you're safe."
	Hermione pressed.
	For several seconds, Hermione could feel herself stop breathing.
	"I know we went a bit overboard with following him around and OK, we talked about messing with Hermione and pranking her but…neither of us would actually have attacked Hermione and it's not like we told Jessica to do it either."
	“Are you here to scold me, Miss Granger?” McGonagall said in a tart voice.
	Andy's voice cut through the haze and Bellatrix's hand was snatched away from Hermione's back as if it had been scalded.
	Hermione pressed closer, shifting one leg between his to straddle his thigh, and his eyes darkened.
	Bellatrix relinquished her mouth, her lips peppering her skin, along the line of her scar, her jaw and to her neck, while Hermione gasped for air, delirious from the sensation.
	Hermione hummed in contentment as she felt Severus' hand withdraw and he began rubbing her thigh slowly.
	Hermione pulled the stopper out and lifted the vial to her lips.
	Hermione blinked up at him, taking in the sight of her handsome former professor, gazing hungrily at her.
	Before anyone could say another word their conversation was abruptly cut short as a powerful blast of magic wrested their attention away from Hermione.
	Hermione exhales slowly, and takes it, raising her eyes to meet Bellatrix’s.
	When their eyes met in the mirror, Hermione blushed and looked away.
	Hermione laughs softly.
	Bellatrix remained in her casual lounging position, half facing Hermione with her arm hooked on top of the back of the sofa, one leg up on the sofa and the other dangling.
	Hermione felt the blood drain from her face.
	Hermione was adamant about not getting 'attached', and Harry thought she might have even convinced herself that whatever it was she had going with Fleur was casual, but he'd never seen her talk about any of their classmates with the sort of bright hunger in her eyes as she did the French girl.
	Hermione almost smacked herself in the head.
	She runs in to a prefect in the hall—one left to patrol during the match, and Hermione rushes up to her.
	"Heh, I am," chuckled Hermione.
	Hermione was confused for a moment then almost groaned aloud at the realisation, lifting her hands to the earrings she'd forgotten she was wearing and quickly removing them.
	"Hermione, Bellatrix, you're up early," Mrs Weasley smiled at them both.
	“Come on, it wasn’t that bad,” Hermione insisted, tired from dragging a sulking Sirius into the lift.
	Hermione chuckled; her friend hated mornings.
	He knew that Harry and Hermione spent a lot of time with the Malfoys and Mr Malfoy was close enough to him that it looked plausible for Neville to trip into the older wizard, grabbing onto Mr Malfoy's robes as if to hold himself upright.
	George knew how he felt about her, but there wasn't any reason to put on a neon sign with little hearts pointing at Hermione for Ginny and Harry's sake.
	His eyes back on Hermione, Snape began to stroke himself.
	Hermione scowled.
	“They’re just over there,” Hermione waved toward the kiddie pen with one hand.
	Hermione frowned at her, trying to decipher what the girl was thinking.
	Hermione knocks on the wooden counter.
	"Granger."
	They talked about far less imposing topics—mostly Riddle was curious about Hermione, asking her questions about her childhood, growing up in America, attending Ilvermorny.
	As an only child, Hermione had a tight bond with her parents.
	She'd seen the other Hermione before when Harry showed her what her manners in the last timeline had been like — or rather, what they hadn't been like.
	“Hermione!
	"Hermione!
	Her eyes locked on Yaxley's as her tongue wet her lips, and Hermione felt her stomach churn as his eyes followed the movement.
	She and Hermione had helped Harry break past the best defences Albus Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel could devise, and would have succeeded in claiming the philosopher's stone, if Flamel hadn't used a fake.
	He dreams of the look on Granger's face when he'd tortured her, and he wakes with her screams still in his ears.
	And then Hermione.
	“I am a fair and just Master, Miss Granger.
	She didn’t stick around to watch the destruction happen--Hermione ran, sprinting down the alley and then, as she barely managed to dodge another hex sent by Riddle, dove into the open doorway of a dingy looking old shack, a wild idea seizing her.
	Marla looked nervous and possible causes started to race through Hermione's head.
	‘Hermione.’ ‘My Theo.’ Hermione would know his voice anywhere, know his aura.
	Hermione just wants everyone to make it out alive.
	"Uh oh," Hermione gasped as the cats came toward her.
	A sharp voice suddenly demanded and Hermione wondered if she'd ever been gladder to hear Snape's voice.
	Hermione woke to the sound of crying.
	If there’s one thing Hermione is sure of, it’s that Bellatrix is trying.
	Hermione had received invitations from Fleur, Draco, Blaise, Daphne and Tracey to stay with them over the break, as well as the option to stay at her home with Tom, but, remembering her previous promise to herself, she'd decided to at least start the holidays by returning to muggle London one last time.
	Hermione looked at him.
	Hermione watched them quietly for a long while, smiling softly at the scene.
	"Simple," Hermione walked over to the nearest wizard in the assembly who was talking to the wizard next to him.
	Hermione stared at Holloway in horror.
	It was a statement, not a question, but Hermione nodded again anyway.
	He’d wake briefly to get up and eat, check the wards, and then collapse back into the bed, gripping Hermione.
	Hermione snorted and re-adjusted the blade.
	Despite the beginning of romance swirling around them at Hogwarts, Tom and Hermione’s relationship had remained the same as it had since their first year.
	Ginny came to rest at Hermione’s side, pulling her close as she broke down.
	For days afterwards, Daphne wouldn't let Hermione out of her sight, for which Hermione was grateful, and which was just as well, because Daphne had pushed out far ahead of him and Hermione in Divination, much to Hermione's chagrin.
	Hermione stomped on his foot and kicked him in the shins.
	To answer, Nagini lifted her head higher encouraging Hermione to stroke her scales.
	“Granger.
	Hermione asked.
	"Hermione," Keeva said.
	“Believe it.” Hermione said “Look at how they treated Harry last year, or the year before, or in our second year.” She rolled her eyes, while the others might have been able to put their heads in the sand about it, she’d had a front row seat to the school’s complete dysfunction when it came to Harry.
	Hermione leaned closer to the mirror to see more clearly.
	If I'm quick with the washing up I bet I can catch Hermione before she finishes her shower."
	Hermione knew it was a mistake as soon as the first memory began.
	Hermione- more than anyone else aside from the Longbottoms- knew exactly what the woman was capable of.
	Hermione hugs her back tightly.
	Harry stared icily at Ron, both boys ignoring Hermione's pleas for peace.
	They’d kind of drifted in that direction, but only because Hermione drew so much of what she did to him from what Severus did to her.
	“Can I practice, too?” Ron asked, and Hermione wondered how she could have been so blind.
	Hermione looks around.
	Hermione reached for a strawberry tart, fingers shaking.
	The Beauxbatons headmistress immediately descended upon Fleur, murmuring to her in quiet French, too low for Hermione to overhear.
	Suddenly, Bellatrix let out a hiss and shoved Hermione down into the snow.
	Hermione leaned back in her chair, letting her head hang back for a moment: maybe the conspiracy theorists had been right all along.
	Hermione joined her, and it was only a few minutes before there was no evidence that the fireplace had been reduced to rubble.
	Hermione reaches under the table.
	Hermione gulped and fidgeted with the hem of her robes.
	Hermione knew this version of Tom had to be a world of improvement over the Tom he would have been otherwise, but though he treated people better and inspired loyalty due to his charm and how much he helped others to be better at their own magic, he was still a master manipulator, and ravenous for power.
	Hermione closed her eyes and tried to follow her example.
	Nimmy remembered what Hermione said about being called property and felt bad.
	Hermione took in the article from their lunch date at Fortescue’s.
	Hermione leaned against the wall and watched her, unable to keep the grin from her lips.
	"How is Mister Granger—" Plato asked, popping into the room.
	Hermione was feeling incredibly anxious and though Dumbledore had assured her that the Aurors were closely monitoring her parents’ home in Australia, she couldn’t help but worry.
	Hermione was silent as he turned a page.
	“Connected like other documents refer back to these ones?” Hermione asked absently, though she didn’t expect Patience to answer.
	Hermione blinked.
	Hermione wailed at the intense stimulation.
	Hermione waited with bated breath.
	Hermione, for fuck's sake, take care of Malfoy."
	“Are you sure, Hermione?
	Perhaps she should simply jump into the sleeping bag with Hermione and give her a right royal seeing to.
	“Hermione,” she began with a frown, “I know I’m no expert on Muggle technology, but I’d like to think I understand it well enough to be confused right now.” “What are you on about?” Hermione turned her head in the direction of Ginny’s attention.
	Hermione settled on a Mattie McHandry fiction novel that was written before the author began writing on goblin and elf histories.
	"I just feel so guilty," Hermione hiccuped.
	Hermione wondered how Dung's early exit could affect the war.
	"Does this mean anything for Hermione?
	Despite that, Hermione now knew Snape had feelings for her.
	Hermione cared not, since she was here only to cheer on her girlfriend.
	Hermione pursed her lips at the witch before she folded herself into the large tub and crossed her arms over her chest trying to control her temper as her grandmother and Narcissa took up sponges to scrub her clean and wash her hair.
	All three men focused on Hermione, who fidgeted on the couch.
	Hermione blanched; she didn’t know if McGonagall knew that Bellatrix was an Animagi and she had promised not to tell anyone.
	Hermione flinched.
	With a warning to stay put, Hermione shoved the cat back into his hiding place and tried the door next.
	“No matter how many lives I saved, Hermione, I was still in a position to save more.
	The potions classroom, Harry decided as he and Hermione entered it, was by far his favourite, in a macabre sort of way.
	Hermione shook her head, her lips pressed into a thin white line.
	Then Hermione heard the bathroom door close and the shower turn on.
	When Hermione finished healing Bella, she’d decided she’d go to St. Mungo’s and pay a visit to Neville’s parents and hoped she could heal their minds.
	Hermione raised her eyes as she took in Narcissa on Harry's arm and he knew he'd have to explain it to her later but that was good as it would give him the chance to ask her to join his practicing.
	Hermione held her breath and shifted quickly out of sight, slipping behind the staircase.
	Hermione lay frozen on the ground flat on her back, shaking for some time, her body barely registering that Lucius had moved away from her.
	Draco—" Theo's voice faded away as Hermione tensed, and his hand twitched as if he wanted to reach out to her.
	"What's your next move, Granger?"
	Hermione doesn't get to hear Fred talk about her, not in the context that Molly is talking about.
	While he was not being overly rough, he wasn't being particularly gentle either and Hermione could feel the moisture accumulating between her legs.
	Harry looked down at Hermione, a shocked gasp tearing from his throat, and from her position on her knees Hermione looked back up at him from under her eyelashes.
	Daniel Granger finally sat back down after messing with the bottles and glasses at the drinks cabinet.
	He made a noise that Hermione took for an approving grunt.
	Narcissa leaned close to Hermione and winked, “Just let her go, she’s due next month and this is what we call the nesting period.
	I have arranged my will, in case of any accidents, and you and Hermione would live with the Rosiers until reaching majority.
	Draco is going to murder me for having lost that, Hermione despaired.
	Hedwig flew over his head and deposited a thick envelope in front of Hermione.
	But finally, Hermione understood.
	Hermione smiled and thought back to a few weeks ago when Harry had invited her to the Greengrass's winter festival.
	True to his word, Fred helped her to her chair in the balcony-they were the first row, center balcony and Hermione didn't want to know what George had paid for these seats.
	He turned to Hermione, hesitating before giving her a slow smile.
	By this point, Hermione was rifling through her drawer for something to wear.
	Neville couldn't help the slight snort that escaped him, even despite himself, and Hermione's mouth curved into a smirk, her amusement clear.
	Hermione smiles tightly.
	Their arrival at the Ministry building is a new experience for Harry and Hermione.
	None of it seemed real to Hermione; none of it.
	He could see his neat scrawl and then Hermione’s beautiful penmanship under it.
	How is she still exactly like Hermione?
	Hermione let out a moan that was positively pornographic, because– "Oh my fucking god, yes, yes, right there!
	Hermione would suggest some alone time with Cho so they could "prepare" for him, Draco would agree, and he'd return two minutes later with an emergency that would bring an end to their sordid threeway.
	Hermione asked Memories are strong, but at days end your mind is yours Miss Granger.
	Hermione curled her hands into fists.
	Hermione turns back towards the front, the goblet glows red, and a piece of parchment is spat out, shooting into the air and drifting downwards.
	"It's—It's about school actually," Hermione stumbled, digging out Bill's letter to Fred.
	Before Hermione could reply to the little Ravenclaw, though, she was rudely interrupted.
	"They will understand," Hermione said quickly.
	"Blimey, Hermione."
	Which was a shame in some ways as Granger steered clear of him altogether.
	"Well, Granger," he replied, his voice husky and wam.
	“I’m sorry, Harry, I know you hate the press like poison, and I know what you said to Zabini, but I really think we’re going to have to take this to the headmistress, so she can call in Head Auror Robards,” Hermione says, and squeezes his arm.
	Intellectually, he definitely wasn't Hermione's equal although he thought she approved of his new studying habits.
	The furniture reminded Hermione of Malfoy Manor, spindly Victorian chairs and chaises.
	“I came to check on you,” Hermione murmured, leaning closer to the gap.
	Hermione hesitated, not sure how to answer.
	"Immobulus," Hermione murmured, and the stag's struggles stilled.
	She came with Hermione's name on her lips, and she wasn't the least bit ashamed of that fact.
	Hermione puts the tray down on the desk, grimacing at the distant tone.
	“No time, Hermione.
	Hermione said fiercely.
	Hermione rolled her eyes and knocked her with her elbow.
	Hermione snarled furiously at him.
	Hermione nodded and retraced the fold in the wrapping paper with shaking fingers.
	"Thank you, Hermione."
	Hermione groaned.
	Hermione hadn’t noticed it before, but the onslaught of curses she had been throwing, one after another with no regard, had drained her considerably.
	“Must have left the balcony open,” Hermione muttered.
	“What idea?” Hermione’s mum asked, her brow furrowed.
	Hermione had never considered what Snape’s patronus was, but somehow the stag seemed to make complete sense.
	Raising her wand, Hermione wrapped herself in her glamour for a few seconds before removing it again.
	"Seriously, Hermione, when did you memorize a dictionary?"
	Hermione reached out her hand to touch an orb, wondering what the repercussions would be.
	Hermione was gone and— I didn’t know what to do.
	He spoke to Severus at length about Hermione.
	“I’m sure you could,” Hermione chuckled, leaning her head into her shoulder.
	He appeared to blanch slightly when he saw her, and Hermione blushed and immediately wished she hadn’t cut her shirt off.
	Narcissa placed the stone dish down and grabbed the sheer gown and helped Hermione into it and clasped her hand once she was covered while Vinda grabbed her other.
	Hermione's eyes narrowed.
	“I give you permission to take the ring off, Hermione, if that is all.
	‘Eleven.’ Hermione’s mind supplied.
	Hermione let out a short puff of air and shoved her thoughts aside.
	His rapidly increasing skill in legilimency was worrisome, and Hermione had correspondingly increased her evening occulumency training sessions with Narcissa.
	Hermione squeaked in surprise as her chair slid across the floor, squeezing her stomach between the table and the chair.
	"Hermione,"—she gestured towards the silk covered object on the wall—"is that what I think it is?"
	"Merlin, Hermione how did you do it?"
	"Hermione?"
	Hermione now stood in the empty classroom, shrinking and pocketing the trunk that contained the portrait of Daphne's grandmother.
	And had everyone listened to me instead of trying to tell me what was best for me then I wouldn’t have freaked out like that!” Hermione yelled back.
	Hermione shivered and pulled her coat a little tighter.
	Hermione had no idea what to do to halt them.
	Hermione was perhaps even more shocked when it was revealed to be not Tom Riddle on their doorstep, but none other than Abraxas Malfoy... and he too came with a massive bouquet of roses.
	Hermione kicked as hard as she could, twisting and turning her torso desperately, but couldn’t connect with anything.
	Hermione grabs Bellatrix’s arm in excitement as Harry frowns, nods, and stands up with Narcissa to go into the house.
	He had wanted to use the main library room in the Chamber to prepare with Abraxas for their own plans for Grindelwald, but in the last week, Hermione had suddenly come back to life, metaphorically speaking, and was constantly calling group members over to her library table or passing notes in class (so unlike her that Tom could hardly believe his eyes), laying out plans and maps like a five star general.
	Hermione sighed, distracted or now.
	Hermione looked out to the pitch just in time to see the Harpies’ Seeker close her fingers around the glittering golden Snitch.
	That night, Hermione and Lucius stood face to face in the living room of the second-floor flat Lucius kept in Hogsmeade.
	He stepped on her toes eight times within twenty minutes, and Hermione rather thought several of the times had been intentional.
	“Makes sense,” said Hermione.
	"That is where you are wrong, Miss Granger.
	Hermione was staring into space, lost in her thoughts.
	Then she pushed Hermione off the side of the dune.
	Hermione gravitated toward a chest of jewels and floated them out one by one to examine.
	Hepzibah was smiling in a very proud way, like she had just done Hermione a great favor.
	In the last three days, Hermione had only managed about three hours of sleep, abusing Pepper-Up potions and drinking so many cups of coffee and tea with so little effect that she suspected the Hogwarts house elves had started to give her decaf.
	Hermione tripped and fell onto her stomach, having the wind knocked out of her while her relatively heavy pack kept her prone.
	They ate lunch with the boys then went outside into the overcast courtyard where Hermione helped Draco and Blaise practice their Transfiguration, as at the end of the lesson Draco's button still had six wiggling legs and Blaise's stubbornly kept its antennae, while Harry and Theo talked about Quidditch.
	Before Hermione or Harry could reply to Draco's announcement in any way, a blank-faced Snape swept into the Common Room.
	[Camera pans to Hermione, who is holding the final rose.]
	"Nah it—it turned out a blue ball of light, you know like the flames Hermione does," he looked up at her, "and it came down and went into my chest and I just knew where to go."
	Hermione clung to him, her heels wrapped around his thighs.
	Draco and Hermione agonised over which of the samples to choose, piecing through the little vials like they were going to sit an exam about follicles any minute.
	“I’m going to take the sword now, Harry,” Hermione said gently.
	He was keeping a lower profile, just as he had done in the early years of Narcissa’s original timeline, but his raw magical ability was immense, especially now that it was bound with and bolstered by Hermione and the others’ magic as well.
	“May I?” At a nod, Hermione unfastened the line of pearl buttons, watching with fascination as Patience’s long torso was revealed, along with a white cotton bra.
	“You mean it’s important to be pretty when you think Jacob will be there and looking at you,” Felicity said as she gripped harder at Hermione’s foot.
	"The headmaster suspects you, Miss Granger, of being involved in the... thievery of the object."
	Hermione and Harry exchanged looks, both puzzled by the behaviour of Draco's goons, but Draco continued on, seemingly oblivious to it.
	Once inside, Hermione tried to catch her breath—shocked to feel her heart racing in a way that had nothing to do with sprinting up several flights.
	Finally he withdrew and the hands gripping Hermione allowed her to drop to the ground, spasming.
	By the time they caught up to Lucius and Narcissa at two large doors, Hermione was thinking only of a lake with still waters, and a book laid open on the shore titled, Afternoon Tea.
	Hermione sighed.
	"Hermione!"
	Hermione rolled her eyes.
	Hermione pulls Bellatrix out of the bed.
	Hermione glanced over at Ginny.
	Hermione’s mouth tightened and she looked away, feeling stung by the fair assessment.
	She followed Hermione in, her grin showing nearly all her teeth.
	He half expected Granger to stun him out of indignation.
	A broken sound tore from Hermione's throat before she could stop it.
	Hermione watched the boy’s reserves crumble away as a blush burned up the back of his neck.
	Harry's so nice and kind and Hermione taught me how to protect myself and how to smile.
	“Ridiculously good pain tolerance,” Hermione answered, mostly honestly.
	The little monkey jumped down from Hermione's shoulder, across the trunk, and up onto Daphne's.
	Hermione was certain, though, that there would be many uses for a wizard’s… semen.
	Hermione, what—” And mean it,” Hermione says firmly.
	Granger asked, firing off her own stunner towards the dummy.
	"Couldn't risk giving you a lower score," Hermione commented, amused.
	If there was ever an example of genetic favoritism, this young woman was it, though Hermione had a feeling that her beauty wasn't entirely natural.
	"I can't wait to see the shots," said Hermione.
	“We should take it slowly,” Hermione cautioned.
	Harry noted the bowl and knife looked pristinely clean and realised Sirius must have handled that while his attention had been elsewhere after Hermione's ritual.
	It was similar to the one Hermione kept for Fred and she wondered if Ashleigh and Steve had those special smiles for each other and she just hadn't noticed.
	He was even more shocked that when Draco let go Blaise yanked him into a quick hug and he could see Daphne squeezing one of Hermione's hands in her own.
	Even if she is a Gryffindor and impulsive at times, Miss Granger strikes me as the kind of witch who weighs all the risks against the benefits before acting.
	Thursday afternoon, Hermione stopped on the pavement at the cafe next to the greengrocer and turned to face Draco with a huff.
	Hermione doesn’t spear him with her ‘you’re an idiot’ glare which Harry takes as a sign she’s still recovering.
	Bellatrix’s hand cupped her face and her thumb wiped at Hermione’s tears, bringing her face closer.
	Harry and Hermione would be in Godric's Hollow this week, not Ron.
	Hermione’s brow crumpled as the meaning of his words sank in.
	Hermione couldn't help her smirk of amusement as Harry visibly blanched.
	"For now," she turned to Hermione once more, "You will be required to resume daily relations with a cycle of all eight of your husbands, under penalty of law."
	Hermione stood at the top of the stairs for some time, wrapping her arms around herself in her torn yellow dress.
	Ginny coughed and Hermione glanced around at her, only to see her friend waving at Bellatrix with a shit-eating grin on her face.
	He cleared his throat and shifted his shoulders, wriggling to get more comfortable without dislodging Hermione.
	Emma Granger smiled mischievously.
	At his explanation, Hermione's eyes widened, and she moved to unclasp the bracelet as though it were suddenly deemed much too valuable and delicate for her to wear.
	And you…get to be free.” Her eyes were narrowed as she looked at Hermione in loathing.
	"I think he approves," Hermione snorted.
	Hermione's veins tingled with dread as she stared down at the Hogwarts Express, thinking of how majestic it used to seem to her.
	“So,” Granger said briskly.
	Hermione groans.
	Hermione knows Malfoy’s gay – he’s got a sodding soulmark with a bloke’s name on it – but Harry still doesn’t think he should confirm it, and break his promise.
	"Apart from Hermione becoming Morgana's own avatar on the battlefield?"
	Hermione stepped backwards once again and slammed the small door shut.
	Hermione had cursed Snape back though-right after he sent the spell.
	“Hermione!”  Hermione rolled her eyes.
	Impeccable manners as always, thought Hermione.
	"You want to talk about Trix and our relationship," replied Hermione.
	Hermione asked, voice trembling.
	Dionysus didn't need to be told twice; he perched on Hermione's lap—on the leg that wasn't already occupied by a warm palm.
	If Hermione hadn't fashioned a garter and strapped hers to her thigh, there would be no place for it.
	Hermione could see he was suffering.
	Hermione swallowed and pushed her concerns for the young girl aside, focusing on what information she could gather.
	Hermione frowned.
	Hermione sit so and the two women watched some nearby ducks for a while.
	“Hermione, if anyone can follow an intuitive leap and be fine, that person is Patience,” Abraxas spoke into her hair, pushing her along.
	"Well, you'd better hurry up, mate, or all the good ones will be gone," he says, and smirks at Hermione.
	“Draco has baby fever,” Ginny whispered the next time Hermione had a free moment.
	Hermione sat there for a few seconds, stunned.
	Hermione jumped.
	Hermione sighs in resignation, recognizing the challenge for what it is and levitating a rock in the air, turning it into a sword that matches Harry's.
	If Bellatrix is going to do it, then Hermione might be able to think up a counter-spell of some kind.
	And for Hermione, he knew what kissing meant to her.
	Hermione would keep out of sight, in the shadows, as much as she could.
	Draco spoke with him while everything was arranged, a hint of color touching his cheeks as Luc said something with a soft laugh and a glance at Hermione.
	Charlie said all of a sudden as he popped the sugar quill out of his mouth and wrapped his little arms around Hermione's neck.
	Hermione walks over to Bellatrix.
	Also, due to the that that he's been freed of the potions and charms, all actions he takes are his own and thus legally he can be prosecuted for any action he takes against the Weasleys.”    “But I haven't.” Hermione's voice was brittle and cold.
	Hermione buried her face against him feeling frustrated.
	Maybe he should write to Hermione and Tom to share his medical records with Miss Rita; a nice smear campaign directed at Moody would certainly cheer him up.
	Hermione sipped her drink and shrugged, the corner of her mouth lifting in a teasing smirk.
	Snape glanced over at Hermione in surprise.
	Shaking her head, Hermione tied her answer to the owl's leg.
	“This would be easier in one of the bedrooms,” Harry muttered and Hermione just laughed breathlessly.
	"Hermione, you aren't seriously worried, are you?
	Hermione can't blame Alicia—Oliver is at Quidditch camp for the summer, and her parents are off in the States on assignment.
	How in Merlin’s name…you’re a mud—mug— you’re on the other side, Miss Granger.” Hermione chuckles.
	"Of course, Miss Granger."
	Hermione looked up at the man curiously.
	Sirius scoffed and opened the others – a pocket watch and pipe from his girlfriend and a new cloak from Remus – and he smiled in thanks, but Hermione could see that he was a little disappointed.
	"Actually, new magic is considered a boon," Hermione says.
	Hermione shook her head, hard, not wanting Ginny to get the wrong impression.
	Those with minor injuries had been sent to some of the other safe houses, but Grimmauld Place kept the most complex and difficult injuries for Hermione and Poppy to care for.
	Though he usually enjoyed watching others be afraid, Tom did not like to see it in Hermione.
	"I do suppose Granger's suffered enough Snape questions for one night.
	“Hermione—” Hermione bit his bottom lip, not so hard to draw blood but it had better bloody well hurt.
	and Harry tried not to feel like the apocalypse was impending as girl and woman nodded at each other, before Hermione linked arms with him and tugged him after her.
	What angered Hermione most about the article was its accuracy.
	Bellatrix’s nostrils flare as she kneels next to Hermione, knife sparkling in the afternoon sun.
	Hermione shrieked, "Kreacher, stop!"
	"Fred would be sneaking joke products all around the house just to bother mum and Hermione'd find one and get another black eye.
	It must have just been sex, or…he doesn’t know it’s Hermione so— Well, Hermione knew her for a bit longer, but Bellatrix didn’t.
	Now though, Hermione was searching for her and every time she spotted her, Bellatrix would turn in to a wolf and slip away in to the woods, out of reach.
	“Thank you, Narcissa,” Hermione began.
	Hermione asked.
	Hermione had the impression that she knew the answer but wanted to see what Bellatrix would say.
	He’s a liar, Hermione.
	The second task was over and Voldemort hadn't won; he was still alive, Hermione was still alive, everyone had lived.
	Then suddenly, “And who asked you to save me, Granger?” He stepped off the wall, neck and shoulders tense.
	Hermione had told him the actions of his future self, though it was obvious she had avoided going into the painful details of how much she and those she cared about had suffered.
	Hermione smirked.
	Hermione shook her head.
	Hermione forced herself to think that Trix wasn't that woman.
	Hermione asked, making a face.
	He couldn't explain what happened, but Hermione looked, in her eyes and on her face, as though there was a looming axe over his brother and there was nothing she could do to stop it.
	Hermione smiles down at her.
	“Please, Harry!” Hermione begged, clutching to his shoulders.
	Hermione sighed as she took a sip of tea, she felt content and at ease now that the Headmaster was no longer near.
	On Friday evening, after a rather steamy walk up the driveway, Draco and Hermione burst through the front door, tearing at each other's clothes, only to find Severus and Lucius waiting for them in the foyer.
	Hermione looked down, smiling slightly, and hoped she looked modest and smitten.
	Hermione found she wanted Draco as a friend and she felt she needed to be cautious with Lucius or she might complicate that hopeful connection.
	Leans to whisper to Hermione.
	The whole time, she knew what she did to Hermione.
	Hermione glares.
	So engrossed in her thoughts, Hermione barely heard Lucius stand and move towards her.
	Hermione moved left.
	Vinda nodded and gestured for Hermione to come close.
	What was most fascinating of all, however, was how quickly everyone accepted Hermione’s existence.
	“Hermione, you should know proper protocol is to have any field injuries assessed back at the Ministry,” James rambled as he hoisted her ankle up enough to inspect her burn.
	“Miss Hermione Granger, Snape Hall,” Lucius had written on the front of the missive.
	Hermione quickly dashed off a reply that she’d meet Ginny in the afternoon to help her organize everything.
	Hermione nodded in satisfaction “To be honest, this isn’t a very convincing simulation.
	"Hm," greeted Hermione as Bellatrix stirred.
	Hermione turned, smiling faintly.
	Harry scanned the boxes and sought out first Sirius and then Hermione.
	Fred walked towards Hermione, a soot covered smile etched on his face, his hands outstretched towards her.
	"Ignore her," Daphne advised in Hermione's ear, pulling her towards the bar.
	Hermione leans into Fred, who looks like he's about to concoct some sort of lie to tell Lee, but Hermione is just—she's more tired than she is hurt right now.
	“Hermione, dear, look at the lovely set of wedding robes in this magazine!
	Snape swirled his robes around him and left the chamber, leaving Hermione standing speechless by the table.
	So, just as Hermione was contemplating taking him inside of her Harry erupted.
	"That sounds perfect," Remus smiled at her, and Hermione sort of smiled back at him.
	"Sorry," Hermione whispered.
	Flora and Hestia were twins in shimmering silver and brilliant gold, standing alongside Vince and Greg who, Hermione rather uncharitably thought, resembled human boulders in their moss-green dress-robes.
	Hermione shrugs.
	"Hermione," Wendell said, and there was a throaty humming sound to his voice, a vibration that poured into the name like honey.
	Hermione took another deep breath as she watched Cedric finally slay the Acromantula he'd been fighting.
	"You shall have the dress on the morrow," she clipped, before turning on her heel and exiting the room, leaving Hermione standing there, half naked and flushed.
	He returned to Hermione with a text she recognized all too well.
	“I am very pleased, Hermione.
	“Another five points from Gryffindor for cheek, Miss Granger.
	He remembered that day like it was yesterday, He’d been lounging on the blankets around the bonfire waiting for Hermione to come back when he heard the windows shatter and felt magic flare from within the house.
	While grateful she had woken up alone, Hermione found that it didn’t soothe her nerves in the least.
	Hermione grinned.
	After lunch, the Prosecution called the third witness to the stand, and Hermione was startled from her still waters when a clerk led in a young girl on trembling legs.
	Hermione gave a thin smile.
	In short, nothing Hermione might have expected from the courtly Lady Malfoy, and as much as her first instinct was to question the other witch's intentions, she felt a strange sense of calm.
	Hermione just nods absentmindedly, already turning away.
	Hermione was burning to ask what that motto was, but knew that would be suspect.
	Hermione closed the door behind her and stood awkwardly, surveying Snape’s stunningly decorated room.
	To anyone else, it would sound like Hermione is asking about something mundane, but Harry knows his best friend, and it is the same voice she used in fourth year when Harry was supposed to be researching for his Tri-Wizard Tournament clues and came up with nothing.
	Only Hermione knows what she should or shouldn’t tell you.
	Back at the common room, Hermione pulled the lovebirds into a secluded corner of the room.
	His hand holds Hermione’s tightly.
	Hermione took Harry’s arm.
	She burst into tears, releasing Hermione's hands and covering her face as she sobbed, bracing herself against the nearest wall like a heartbroken woman in one of those old romance movies that Hermione's mother used to watch.
	Hermione felt the pounding in her ears again.
	Hermione spent the nights putting things into place, ready to set her back up plan into motion.
	Hermione groans.
	This time— she didn't know what would happen when he said her name surrounded by Hermione and his brothers, surrounded by Hermione and Fred.
	Apparently satisfied that Harry wasn't going to freak out and run, Hermione watched as Tom started to explore Harry's upper body with his hands, touching the younger boy everywhere; stomach, chest, arms, sides, waist, hips.
	Hermione let out a choked sound as her heart thudded in her chest.
	Hermione was smiling now and Blaise grinned back at her before his expression turned serious again.
	"Thank you," Hermione said to thin air, the elf having already disapparated.
	Hermione clapped one hand over her mouth and climbed the steps away from Draco before grinning at him.
	Hermione stared at him and felt unwanted tears of humiliation prick at the corner of her eyes.
	Hermione looked around just in case she'd missed her.
	Draco just didn't see how his Godfather could be what Hermione needed in the long haul.
	Hermione smiled, wondering if she’d just saved the world or bargained it away to the devil himself.
	Hermione patted Harry's back and eased away gently.
	Neville likely would have come to the same conclusions as Hermione, but he would have taken full advantage of the opportunity to stand up to Snape as an adult.
	Hermione was practicing the most advanced spells she’d ever seen, day and night.
	“Hermione, don’t be daft.
	“I’m not going to let him die alone, Hermione.
	Bellatrix laughed as she realised what Hermione was doing.
	Hermione and Ginny have some conversations.
	Tom looked at Hermione’s translation, his brow creasing.
	Hermione looked down at the floor.
	What if Hermione isn’t the only one who has crossed universes?
	For the first time since she was a little girl, it felt like Hermione was the only one in her body.
	Hermione glanced back at Bellatrix whose eyebrow had risen.
	Dorea called, and, with a soft pop, a small, spritely house-elf appeared in front of the Potters and Hermione.
	“Quite easily blamed on your friends,” Bellatrix shot her a little smirk, allowing her thumb to stroke Hermione’s hand before she slowly removed hers.
	After a moment of surprised hesitation, Bellatrix wrapped her arms around Hermione’s waist and kissed her back.
	She morphs her features into a younger Hermione.
	Reaches for Hermione’s hand again and kisses her knuckles.
	Hermione, by contrast, refused to let up on anything, and when December rolled around, it was to find his muggleborn friend in a state of near panic over her very first lesson as a teacher, even if only in a supporting role.
	Hermione leaned back in chair.
	Hermione grasped her hand gratefully.
	Bill promised Hermione's Mum with a wink.
	Hermione wracked her brain as she tried to think of how Narcissa could have possibly witnessed any interaction between them, and it had been Draco who'd broken up with her, not the other way around.
	"I'm sorry, Hermione.
	He said looking at Hermione cautiously.
	You stay here and look after Hermione, and I'll go and get it—" "No," Hermione said, "it makes much more sense if I take the Cloak and—" Hermione snapped.
	Fleur starts muttering in French, too quickly and quietly for Hermione to understand anything.
	Hermione tossed on the flimsy cot in his room, sometimes wandering the house, sometimes running the tap in the bathroom and then returning to her room.
	He could not stop the hiss of breath that escaped him, nor the choked sound of his voice as he whispered, “And Herm--Miss Granger?” “I want to heal Hermione.” She was going to take him to Hermione.
	“I’m serious, Granger,” he continued, “he’s my Godfather and I’ve spent a lot of time with him, especially since Mother…” He looked down and let out a slow breath.
	She perched herself lightly on the bed - impossibly lightly, Hermione thought, wondering how she did not feel the shift of weight beside her - and reached over, placing her hands on either side of Hermione's face.
	He had a ring on his left thumb that Hermione had seen often as a sort of Slytherin house ring.
	Hermione pursed her lips, returning her attention back to her book, muttering, "So disrespectful."
	Parvati turned away but Hermione caught her quiet murmur, “So am I.” .” Hermione chewed her bottom lip.
	Harry would rather die than lose Ron and Hermione, and suddenly he wants nothing more than to go and speak to them, to apologise.
	Hermione nodded.
	Even warped by the clench of his fist, Hermione recognizes her own handwriting on the envelope in Lupin's hand.
	Hermione didn’t know what would happen the longer she went unfound.
	“Oh it’s on now, Granger.
	“Any of the houses would be thrilled to have either of us, Tom,” Hermione responded absently, still engrossed in her work.
	Its what Hermione Granger did before, during, and now after the great Gryffindor Romance of 95'.
	“It started out all right,” he said, and there was a world-weariness to his tone that Hermione did not recognize.
	Hermione lets out a relieved breath.
	Hermione could see it in his face.
	“Hermione what the bloody hell are you doing?
	Within a few months, though, Hermione’s affectionate nature took over, and Narcissa found herself the recipient of more embraces than she’d ever experienced in her life.
	Hermione couldn’t figure out why he looked angry.
	Bellatrix mumbles out some curses, pulling Hermione along after him.
	"You're having sex with your professor," Hermione said with wide eyes, scandalised.
	Ukrainian Ironbelly hide body-armor, Hermione concluded after studying him for a moment; for spell and weapon protection, unless he had a dragon taming hobby she didn't know about.
	Oh, Hermione they are wonderful.
	"Yes, Miss Granger, very powerful.
	"I agree with Hermione," Harry said, and when Sirius cleared his throat, he added, "and Sirius."
	As a result, Hermione was enjoying a rare, perfect moment when it was just Harry, Herself, and Ron.
	Hermione turned around, having finished the fabric.
	Hermione wants to comfort him.
	"Well, curl up nice and cozy then, Granger.
	Hermione glared at him before she turned to Harry.
	One, Theo notes, has his knife to Hermione's throat; the other points a gun at Harry's head.
	Just when Hermione was about to step forward, and try to do something — anything — there was a commotion behind her.
	Hermione asked, weighing the words against their silence.
	"So I'm going to go with the notion that you still want to date Granger, Potter."
	Hermione blinked down at it.
	Someone dangerous trained you.”  Hermione said nothing.
	Harry was pink-cheeked but smiling as he danced with McGonagall, and Hermione was about to stand up and make her way over to the pair when somebody cleared their throat from next to her.
	“Shit!” Hermione swore.
	He let her go, and Hermione tumbled backwards, landing on her bum in the muddy grass with a loud “plop!”  Squinting through the rain, Hermione could see the rage grow in Snape’s eyes, fury glaring out at her from his dark, wet bangs, now plastered to the sides of his head.
	“Pull that again girl, and I will be pulling your tongue through your teeth.” She hissed, slamming Hermione on the ground again as she clambered to get away from the woman atop her.
	When Ginny entered the room a few minutes later, Harry was sitting at the table sipping his tea and Hermione had James back in his booster working on the remainder of his lunch.
	Hermione hugged her friend fiercely, unembarrassed to let the tears fall in the middle of the Great Hall.
	Hermione sat up, staring at him.
	Severus stood gripping their bags and extended his other hand towards Hermione.
	Hermione’s eyes flew open as Bellatrix’s fingers pushed her over the edge and she cried out, calling Bellatrix’s name over and over as she clung to her; her rock in the storm.
	"Hello Hermione," Tom said, sliding gracefully beside her on the bench.
	Sensing he was getting close and getting impatient, Hermione withdrew and quickly removed her blouse and bra, enjoying the glazed over look in Harry’s eyes.
	Hermione asked, concerned by his uncharacteristically anxious face.
	“Leave that to me.” Hermione scribbled something onto her parchment.
	Hermione nodded.
	Hermione looked down and played with the ring on his hand.
	Hermione was concerned– Harry was just about trembling with fury with his hands clenched into fists.
	Hermione rose.
	Hermione was stirring, her head twisting as though trying to shake herself awake.
	Hermione knew from second-hand accounts that Molly had vehement objections to her advocacy for the Dark Arts, but it was not a conversation they had ever actually had together.
	“We promised to support Tom, to help him make positive changes in the magical world,” Hermione put a hand on his elbow.
	"So," her mother asked once Emma had crawled away again, casting a curious look at Hermione.
	Hermione was extremely grateful that Hepzibah didn’t ask, only smiled another doleful smile.
	Hermione was going to tear her hair out.
	No one but Hermione.
	Guilt flooded Hermione and she felt her face heat with shame.
	Hermione exclaimed.
	Sirius roared the moment Hermione vanished.
	He spat at her and Hermione knew she should be de-escalating this, she really did, but the problem was she had a temper too.
	No, Hermione thought.
	“I’m very sorry, but we really do need to go,” Hermione said tightly.
	“We made a promise; nothing until Hermione has finished her exams.
	Hermione grunted and mashed her clit against his pubic bone, effectively pulverizing her pearl to orgasmic dust.
	The sound of knocking, the same rat-a-tat-tat pattern Sting had used, had Hermione twisting around to face the closed door.
	Hermione asked.
	However, when Hermione entered the owlery, she found that she wasn’t the only one there.
	Hermione can’t believe this.
	For those of you looking for more interaction between Draco-Astoria or Lucius-Hermione, sorry to disappoint but you won't be getting that in this story.
	"We will if you tell us your secrets," George grinned, despite his Dogwood wand, which was much less suited for non-verbal magic than Hermione's Vine or Fred's Cedar.)
	“Go back to sleep,” Hermione heard Severus say firmly after she slumped off his body and onto the bed.
	She slid him some no-maj money, and it was still incredible, Hermione thought, how used to that Americans were.
	She cups Hermione’s face.
	At this point, Hermione grabbed Luna by the collar of her uniform and yanked her up.
	I’m a very bad boy, Miss Granger.
	Its not like the horcrux, not as dark, but still… Hermione’s tone urged caution.
	"You know, you seem to have a habit of being wherever I am, Granger.
	Hermione had no control when the combination of Bellatrix’s voice and her other half’s painful eagerness had her standing up to leave the tub.
	From her hometown library, after that first summer, Hermione brought back memoirs and brightly-colored pamphlets that Harry read through instead of finishing her Potions homework.
	“I can’t… Hermione…” “Hermione, you can’t.” Hermione’s wand jabbed the air as she shot the protective spells in a high arc around the tent, glaring fiercely at Ron all the while.
	Hermione escorted them toward the entrance hall, chattering away about baby books and what she was going to bring when she came over.
	Ginny had rolled her eyes and Hermione offered a weak smile.
	"Oh," Hermione said, and just the sound made Scorpius' smile widen even further.
	Hermione said, jaw tight.
	Hermione: "Why?
	When it reached her clit, it pulsed, becoming more sensitive and engorged than Hermione had ever remembered it being.
	Hermione turned, face still hot with anger, to collide with Harry, who was adjusting his glasses and staring at his feet as he walked.
	"I'm Fenrir Greyback, the most feared werewolf in Britain," the man's voice lowered to a growl and Hermione's heart raced as she tried to think through the dark fog that was clouding her head, her struggles growing progressively weaker as her brain was deprived of oxygen.
	Hermione doesn’t let go of his hand as she just closes the distance between them, clambering up onto his bed to envelope him in a hug.
	"Mother—" There was a protest in his voice, and Hermione didn't know who it was for.
	“You aren’t.” Ginny confirmed “Hermione… she’s gotten this ability to sense magic.
	“The astronomy tower!” Ginny and Hermione said together, drawing looks from Hannah and Neville.
	Hermione couldn't tell if the weakness of his voice was due to the effects of the spell of because he was badly injured.
	Hermione looked down, clearing her throat.
	The bowls in front of them filled with pumpkin soup, and Hermione was reminded that she barely ate dinner earlier.
	Although tears continued to stream down her face, Hermione managed to wrinkle her nose at him.
	Hermione gave Ron a scandalized look for his disrespectful tone, but she didn't bother with a reprimand.
	"Oh, no," Hermione frowns.
	Perhaps whatever was causing Hermione’s other strange powers knew she was injured and decided to manifest itself to help her.
	Hermione turned slightly and saw Sirius just next to a tall cabinet.
	“And you can’t… you can’t heal them with a charm?” Hermione asked the matron, whose face was drawn and pinched with worry.
	Taking in his stiff stance, Hermione felt a tired smirk stretch across her face.
	Hermione Granger: destroyer of horcruxes, companion of the Boy Who Lived, war-hero and living legend.
	It had seemed very enlightening to sixteen-year-old Hermione but nineteen-year-old Hermione didn't care for it.
	He falls silent after that, and Hermione isn't sure what to say.
	What the school will not teach us, Hermione, we must teach ourselves.” Hermione recognized her own thoughts, especially from her fifth year, and nodded, hoping that she could guide him slowly.
	“Weekends,” Bellatrix chuckled, striding over to the bed, making Hermione scramble to a kneeling position on the bed so that she was the right height for a kiss.
	Swallowing hard, Hermione closed her eyes and searched her soul for the right answer.
	Hermione thought of her old self again, lying at the base of this very statue, studying a potions book.
	"You really should talk to Professor McGonnegall about him, Harry," Hermione added.
	She and Harry had arrived first and Hermione, unable to sit still, had found herself pacing as they waited for Fleur to arrive "I know," Hermione sighed, just as confused by her own behaviour as Harry was.
	Hermione,” he said.
	Hermione subsided.
	Hermione felt as though she might start glowing but she forced herself to shrug rather than beam at him.
	Professor McGonagall sat down, looking at the Grangers.
	Hermione refused to allow him to look into the room.
	Hermione exhaled loudly, even as disbelief filled her as she realized just exactly what magic Tom had performed.
	“Teenagers,” Hermione huffs to herself.
	"Hermione!"
	Breathe, Hermione.
	However, Hermione used the pain to keep her mind focused on not dropping the books.
	Sirius grinned and gestured over Harry's shoulder to where Hermione stood, quietly taking in the scene in front of her.
	Hermione scowled.
	Hermione knew that it probably had something to do with her lack of response to Bellatrix's note from this morning, which was now safely in her clutch; a little reminder of why she was here.
	“Uh.” Hermione glanced down at the book on her desk.
	Hermione laughed.
	Hermione keeps throwing up shields, but the spells are stronger and stronger and suddenly a green light is shooting towards Ginny and Hermione's heart stops.
	Harry just about whispered before looking at Hermione again.
	That was until the Grangers won their lawsuit.
	Now that they were riding in the carriage in closer quarters, Hermione couldn’t stop herself from saying something.
	Snape exited, pushed his red cloak over one shoulder and turned, offering his hand to Hermione.
	Everyone run as fast as you can,” Hermione looked at Tom, who nodded.
	“It wouldn't hurt anything to take them.” Hermione argued.
	[Scene opens with Ron and Hermione.]
	Hermione's breath hitches.
	Hermione closed her eyes and exhaled deeply, willing herself to believe that last sentence to be true.
	Hermione cringes back.
	"Ron could win a game of Chess," Hermione said, her voice labored as her fingers fidgeted with the wrapper.
	"Hermione," Kingsley smiled up at Hermione as she approached, depositing a squirming Emma on the floor.
	When Hermione drifted back to consciousness, she felt someone behind her kissing her neck and gently massaging her breasts.
	Where’s Hermione, is she still asleep?
	When Harry steps out of the tiny bathroom, clean and dressed in fresh clothes, the first thing he sees is Hermione Granger standing in the middle of his room.
	Hermione pulled miracles from her bag.
	Hermione nodded and checked her watch.
	The changes that had taken place in Hermione when she found out she was pregnant and later when the boys were born had not escaped Blaise either.
	Beaming at Harry and Ron, Hermione spilled Snape’s secrets in a breathless outpouring of delight, “Most recently Severus has been working on a salve to heal the traumatic scarring caused by dragon pox.” When Severus didn’t respond, Hermione answered for him, “They’ve been using it at St. Mungo’s to great success.” “And that’s not all,” Hermione went on.
	Splinters and large pieces of barks went flying left and right and Hermione knew that it wouldn’t hold out for long.
	We have so much to talk about,” the woman said as she stood up and approached Hermione, who continued to sit gobsmacked.
	Hermione didn't know if it was out of grief that the other rooms weren't used, or if Ginny assumed she didn't want to be alone.
	Hermione’s expression softens.
	Something shifted, and it took him a few seconds to understand that Hermione had let her magic loose, had finally stopped holding it in.
	He had expected Granger to be too traumatised by memories of the torture she had experienced in his familial home to ever return to it again, let alone make it her home.
	“It often takes a surprise encounter or unexpected exposure for people to become interested in this lifestyle, Miss Granger.” He reached up with a hand to brush his fingers across his jaw.
	Except with Hermione.
	And with that, Bellatrix falls backwards onto the bed, pulling Hermione with her.
	Charlus turns back to Harry and Hermione.
	Blinking, Hermione stood upright.
	Hermione spun to find a freckled young girl with blonde hair blinking back at her.
	Hermione tried to focus on the page before her but her eyes were swimming with tears.
	He gave Hermione one last look and a small salute before headed down the stairs.
	Hermione pulls back, pushes on Bellatrix’s shoulder so she has some room and looks up at her.
	“Wait, Hermione,” Anthony called after her.
	But as Hermione examined the shelves, she knew it was not there.
	Hermione flinched at the rawness in his voice.
	"Hermione," Harry said, staring at the blonde Death Eater slumped opposite of Dolohov, "How did you know?"
	“Hermione?” He says cautiously.
	It seems your little mu--that is, Miss Granger, is on to you.
	Beneath him, Hermione trembled.
	Harry leaned on a railing and felt the cold salt spray on his face, and spotted Hermione striding by.
	"He looks amazing," Hermione said, picking her cat up.
	It was Hermione – and both men knew how remarkable she was.
	You have literally taken the future of the wizarding world in your hands, you and Hermione, and though I could say from my safe vantage point as a person who hasn’t witnessed what you have that sounds incredibly arrogant, I know it was bad.
	Later, when she was thinking of what she had done, Hermione wished she was able to say that she had acted instinctually, that her motions had been without conscious thought.
	"And you've grown entirely too vain for my liking," Hermione shot back, grinning.
	Hermione: [confused] "Wait.
	Instead, Hermione moved forward and hugged Lily tightly before she stepped back.
	Harry slept on inside, the Horcrux locket around his neck, while she and Sirius stood out, side-by-side by the fire—Hermione desperately trying to freeze the flames, and Sirius doing so with great ease, all wandlessly.
	Every spell, every hex, deep pulling at his elemental magic, and he even reached for Hermione’s and Abraxas’s magic, but they were far away, not in the castle, not even on the grounds.
	The elves helped Draco up into the saddle, and Hermione mounted behind him.
	Who could even suggest that Hermione Granger, founder of Dumbledore's Army and best friend of Harry Potter, would be dabbling in Death Eaters and Dark Magic?
	Narcissa put down her book and crossed to Hermione immediately.
	Hermione moved her hand from Abraxas’s muscled chest to his hip, to the waistband of his pants.
	What actually went through her mind was that this vile man had touched her dearest friend, her lover, her Patience, had hurt her, and intended to do so again, to hurt all the people Hermione loved.
	Professor Merrythought tipped up Hermione’s chin.
	Hermione turned away.
	Hermione internally swore; was he not working this evening?
	Hermione had no sense how long they had travelled, how far they had come or even in what direction they were headed: she whipped her head around at every little noise, movement or shadow while Bellatrix dragged her along.
	It seems that they were wed in the Headmaster’s Office of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry on the nineteenth of September, nineteen ninety-six, on the evening of Miss Granger’s seventeenth birthday.
	Eager fingertips found her nub, however, and her quickening breath was all the encouragement Hermione needed.
	Hermione gave an almost imperceptible nod.
	Hermione stops.
	"I'll come with you," Ginny piped up, looking at Hermione with concern.
	“What about you?” Hermione asked breathlessly, aching to have Patience touch her with more than her breath.
	Ginny made some of the younger year boys levitate Neville up to his room and then took Hermione to Madam Pomfrey personally.
	“If you stay, you won’t regret a thing, Hermione.” You want to have her connections, the power and money she might supply in the future, and sex is the easiest way to guarantee your access to it!” Hermione’s cheeks were flushed, her mouth was swollen, and Tom could hardly focus on her words.
	What did you say earlier, Miss Granger, some need a good hulling?” It was a rhetorical question; he didn’t wait for an answer.
	He gripped the sofa as Hermione pulled his cock upright and wrapped her fingers around it.
	The older woman sent a satisfied smirk towards the gazebo, and gestured for Hermione to continue on with her.
	Hermione wailed in his ear, but he could barely hear her over the pounding of his own pulse.
	And though it was blasphemous to think, in this moment, Hermione felt she had lost Tom Riddle.
	It was not in Hermione’s nature to deliberately do something incorrectly or at less than her capabilities.
	"Good evening, Miss Granger.
	When the clock chimed ten, Hermione returned to her room and dragged her armchair over to the window so she could watch for Draco's bedroom light.
	Grief is fresh on my mind and I, like Hermione, am very bad a processing it.
	Oh my God, he’s going to rape me!, Hermione’s brain spun in a million directions as it sunk in.
	"I see more in the distance," said Hermione, trying to peer further but finding it harder to make out any details.
	Her eyes were open and staring vacantly at Hermione.
	Draco called, flagrantly feigning normality, and though Theo's eyes narrowed—and across the table, Hermione's mouth had become its most thinly pursed version—he consented to turn, making his way to their table.
	Hermione danced her fingers up his tie to drag the tip of her nail along his jaw.
	Granger purred at the tickle and started the water so the tub began to fill.
	Exhaustion crept up on Hermione quicker than she expected and she found that she was leaning heavily on her friend as it made itself known.
	Unable and unwilling to resist her, he went to her, enjoying the contentment that washed over him when Hermione wrapped her arms around his waist and rested her head against his chest.
	Hermione had experienced only had a moment’s envy at missing out on the position she had so coveted in her younger years.
	“I don’t know if it will be chaos…” Hermione trailed off, memories of previous Christmas’ with the Weasleys surfacing.
	“Continue.” Harry said, and Hermione realized his game.
	Hermione gasped.
	Hermione followed her in silence as they both ran through the corridors, up stairs and towards a much higher ground of the castle.
	He didn't have anything at the moment that would cause the inspectors issue, apart from personal items like his cloak, but… when the Grangers were to move over to the island, which he wanted them to do as soon as the wards were up….
	Hermione muttered to Professor Black when they were alone again.
	There is more to both of us—it’s just—just waiting to get out.” Hermione traced her fingers along his.
	Hermione pushed her hair back out of her face and marched them all to Platform 9 3/4, the entrance mechanism of which she had read all about.
	Hermione pushed to her feet, gaping at the small bunk beds and hammocks.
	shouted Hermione, causing a jet of white sparks to spew forth from her wand, shocking the toad.
	“Granger,” he hissed.
	Hermione and Snape came in on the tail end of a conversation about naps.
	He glances at Hermione and finds her beside him, steadfast as always.
	Hermione attempted to smile back, but knew that it had come out as a pained grimace instead.
	“Miss Granger is a Gryffindor, Albus, and as you say, she has exacting ideas about justice.
	"I couldn't sleep," Hermione admitted with a frown.
	Hermione stumbles backwards, wand drawn.
	Hermione took her glass and headed inside.
	Walking on Moody’s arm was difficult, as he didn’t so much walk as hobble, but Hermione was grateful for the chance to speak with the gruff and scarred old wizard alone.
	Hermione asked incredulously, glancing at his sheet.
	“Hermione,” Bella’s soft voice called out.
	Hermione knew what was coming when madame Pomfrey put a hide-rod in Bellatrix' mouth and took out her wand.
	“ ‘Don’t touch Hermione’  ,  ‘don’t look at Hermione’  , I believe there was a strongly implied  ‘don’t lick Hermione’ in there as well.” Under different circumstances, Hermione might have been amused at the way James’ face contorted into a mix of bafflement and alarm at the look of fury she gave him as he crossed into the receiving room.
	“Everything has been cleaned, and there will be nobody but us for quite some time, Miss Granger.
	Hermione tried to get her feet under her, but they were rubbery.
	Everyone except Hermione turned to Sirius hopefully.
	"Hermione cheating in what?"
	“Have any of you seen Hermione yet?” he asked as he pulled out his wand to tap his trunk, applying a quick feather-light charm so he could lift it up into the storage space above their heads.
	"Hermione knows I'm sorry but she's not going to think about getting back together until I've shown her that I trust her."
	"I will," Hermione said without hesitation.
	Hermione remembered the screeching portraits, cursing their daughter, screaming at her for betraying them, for bring her into the house… I knew they wouldn’t be like my parents; how could they be, when you are… you?” She stroked her thumb over the back of Hermione’s hand as she contemplated how to continue.
	Hermione shrugged, knowing her cheeks were tinged pink.
	"Miss Granger… your tubers.
	Hermione blinked and decided to go along with Pansy, because she hadn’t the foggiest idea of how to stop her.
	“So now even the Headmaster owes you a private lesson, does he Miss Granger?
	Hermione Jane Granger, his best friend, the only person in the entire world that he loved.
	Sirius stepped away from her, though his gaze never left her face, trying to commit his last moment with Hermione Granger to memory.
	“Relax, Miss Granger.
	Hermione raises an eyebrow.
	More of a ‘snow-box’, Hermione thought, glumly.
	Hermione's mind went blank as she inhaled the scent of that sandalwood cologne, as she stared into a set of eyes that were like two bottomless, black holes.
	Everyone but Harry and Hermione seemed pretty sure that Snape could easily be behind things, which left Harry feeling off kilter and strange – wouldn’t he know if his teacher was really out to kill him?
	Hermione gave him a thin smile.
	Madge is already the star pupil at Herbology, and Draco didn’t have a single fight in the halls the entire week before break,” his eyes had a bit of the twinkle Hermione recognized from the future.
	Madam Selwyn had also drawn her wand, and she gripped Hermione’s arm with a cool soothing touch while performing her own medical diagnostic spells.
	Three weeks into their time at Shell Cottage, Hermione hears a pounding on the front door, but she doesn't get up.
	Hermione’s mouth dropped open.
	Before they said their goodbyes, Gellert pulled Hermione in close and murmured to her, “Don’t fear Albus, my little one,” he said in a soothing tone, his other hand rubbing her back.
	All heads turned toward the door as the sound of Hermione’s uproarious laughter filtered down the hall.
	Hermione gasped and stepped backward into the yew hedge.
	“He’s either Fred and George or Fred and Hermione.
	Neville hung back in the corridor just outside the room until he was joined by Hermione and Ron.
	"It's much more interesting," Hermione gushed.
	Once the adrenaline from the battle had worn off, he had collapsed by Hermione's bedside, sobbing into his hands.
	Hermione freezes as she gets under the covers, her brain exploding from the amount of conflicting information that just hit her.
	“I know what they did, Hermione.
	“Hermione, don’t start this again.
	Hermione nodded and watched everyone but her husbands leave.
	Hermione remember that, during the Battle of Hogwarts, it was Vicky whom had led a group of the younger students.
	Hermione prodded Lucius in the nipple to wake him up.
	They both inhaled sharply, and Granger’s eyes went wide, as if she’d forgotten what it felt like to be fucked.
	Not much resided in the sole book that I found; there was even a page missing as I recall,” Hermione knew that she was referring to the same book she had found only a few weeks back.
	"Come on, Granger, don't be scared."
	"Dr. Granger, we need you, there's nobody else - " Hermione asked, turning to run after the orderly.
	Hermione vowed to never bring up the painful subject of scars around any of them.
	Severus made his way over to Hermione’s bed and sat beside her.
	Not unless Miss Granger is hissing instructions in his ear."
	“Yes, she is,” Slughorn replied while Hermione tried to hide her smile.
	Tom recovered first, rising beside Hermione.
	Hermione chuckled knowingly “That’s very flattering Harry, you can look but no -ohhh- touching.
	Care to explain what the hell's going on with Granger?"
	Glances at Hermione.
	Hermione sat back in her chair, shaking her head, and as Harry was folding the morning’s Daily Prophet, she caught a glimpse of a blonde head.
	Hermione could feel her face once more flushing with heat.
	Hermione shook her head faintly.
	Hermione could practically see the potential lies spinning in their minds, but there really was no time for convincing Myrtle.
	I told Hermione (that's her name, by the way) that if she was really worried, I would go with her to whatever House, even if she got into Slytherin.
	If that monster found Miss Granger or Miss Lovegood or any of these children who should not be fighting a war, Greyback could do far more damage than Dolohov's Curse.
	Hermione felt Malfoy suddenly drop.
	"After all Hermione's had to go through I bet it'd be small.
	"- I think I've had enough of this game," Hermione murmured.
	Hannah and Neville went off to do their own thing, and Hermione told them to not wait up for her, she had a project she was reading up on, so Harry walked Susan back, at least until they needed to part ways.
	“I don’t care.” Hermione jerked free from Harry and pushed her jaw up.
	Hermione explained.
	By the time early afternoon came around, Hermione was decidedly less excited.
	Hermione praised him, folding her arms.
	From the time Lucius first brought her home to meet him and Astoria, Granger would chat pleasantly with Astoria and was always civil to Draco whenever they were in the same room.
	Slowly, using minimal force as though he were a fisherman, he tugged Hermione backwards until he could wrap his arms possessively around her waist again.
	Lucius paused, and Hermione held her breath as he calculated.
	He kept it going without missing a beat as Bellatrix turned to her with a haughty look and starting prowling towards her, making Hermione quickly begin to back away.
	Hermione exclaimed.
	Hermione craned her neck in both directions, but she saw no army.
	Through the rest of the day, Hermione kept her distance from Tom and concentrated on her work, though she couldn’t stop thinking about what he’d said.
	Hermione's breath caught.
	Hermione frowned at her.
	Gods, Hermione.
	Ron growls, but Hermione's voice does not waver as she replies, "Penelope Clearwater.
	Hermione closed her eyes and groaned internally before turning.
	Her mother gasped at the name, and Hermione nodded shamefully.
	Hermione counted her heartbeats.
	Hermione adjusted her grip.
	Hermione blinked in shock at his words.
	“Those two acted fast,” Neville added, seeing where Hermione’s gaze was directed.
	Thankfully, Narcissa had carried the rest of that conversation because Hermione hadn’t been able to concentrate.
	Leaving Pansy and Ginny, Black span on her heel, only to spot Hermione watching her with a smirk.
	While Hermione was trying to distract herself, Lucius continued to take in the show on stage.
	Hermione almost did a double-take.
	Bellatrix was demure, timid, apologetic and embarrassed, constantly cursing herself and apologizing to Hermione for wasting so much of their time.
	Hermione felt her eyebrows raise to her hairline.
	Straightening in her chair further, Hermione retold her tale, “I was packing for holiday when Mahira and Crooks started going spar, I thought they were chasing a mouse,” Hermione shivered, “but when Crooks pounced and Mahira was pecking trying to get at whatever Crooks had under his paw...it changed into Rita Skeeter.” Hermione waved a dismissive hand, “That was easy, I used a spell to force her to change back after I conjured a jar.
	Killing Dumbledore and climbing the ranks was the only way to get her out.”  Hermione felt herself grow pale.
	Hermione could see the moving picture of herself smiling up at her.
	Hermione didn’t know what there was to say.
	But the days turned into weeks, and he barely saw Hermione outside of class.
	Hermione’s chest tightens.
	But you're not Eloise Mintumble, you're Hermione Granger, prodigy and smartest witch of her age.
	"It's Hermione.
	Hermione and Bellatrix watch Speio whirl through the water.
	It was too big, she could already tell, and the material was dirty and faded, but at this point Hermione honestly ,didn't care– she wasn't a pretty picture herself right now; her tunic-dress was torn and filthy from sleeping on the ground, as were her once-white stockings, she smelt awful from the lack of access to basic hygiene and digging through rubbish bins looking for food, and her hair was a wild mess of limp, broken curls that spilled chaotically over her shoulders.
	“I made some tea, and fetched a headache potion from your mother’s cabinet,” Hermione looked up to see Patience standing above her, holding out a teacup and a small vial.
	I think Hermione’s on board, isn’t she?” “…I suppose I’ll have to figure it out,” said Hermione.
	Hermione's eyelashes fluttered and her brain stopped functioning properly.
	Hermione stepped out of the floo at Andromeda's house, dusting off her clothes and stepping aside just as her husband stepped through behind her.
	“Britt is…she’s an exceptional submissive.” Hermione felt her insides crash to floor.
	Hermione slipped under the covers and lay there, looking up at the ceiling.
	"It's doing something," Hermione said, staring down at the cup that appeared to be filling with liquid and eventually overflowing onto the ground.
	Hermione frowns.
	Le Petit Cochon was a charming establishment that sold a variety of French foods — most of which were not remotely tempting to the average Hogswarts student— escargots, bouillabaisse, and something Hermione wasn’t entirely certain was not made of frogs’ legs.
	And Hermione is still going.
	She's dying, anyway, Hermione reminded herself.
	That one caught Hermione's attention.
	Hermione shattered around him.
	“If we keep healing it every two minutes the spells will probably continue working for another twenty hours,” Hermione told her gently.
	“Good thinking,” Hermione whispers to Ron.
	Sirius inquired, stepping forward and taking possession of Hermione's wand before she ended up cursing Ron with something permanent.
	Some of the professors that she was close to already knew that Anna was Hermione, but not all of them.
	“It was fine,” Hermione said blushing.
	"Well," Hermione said hesitantly, "it's just—I really don't—" "Your counterattacks are quick, but your defensive motions are slow," Hermione clarified.
	Hermione looked a touch stunned in the face of his anger.
	Hermione thought for a moment that Dumbledore looked relieved, although she could find no reason for him to ask nor for him to be relieved at her answer, no matter how hard she thought about it.
	Any minute Lucius and Hermione could apparate to the Ministry and tell the world about Delphini’s existence and your survival.
	Standing in stiletto grey heels was one of the sexiest women Hermione had ever seen.
	Hermione didn’t have time to ask before the older woman had her wand facing in her direction.
	Hermione cringed as she felt the second hand walk its way up her neck and into her hair, the seemingly gentle movement tainted by nothing but ill intent.
	Hermione takes a slow breath.
	Hermione shoved his hand away, glaring halfheartedly at him before pulling a book out of her satchel and resting it gently on top of the cats to shield them from the wind as she started to read.
	That left Draco and Theo to dote on Hermione.
	As Hermione slid her mouth down from his, switching to sucking and biting lightly at his throat, he first became aware that this wasn't following the usual patterns of their kissing, but he didn't realize Hermione's quick fingers had untied the drawstring of the expensive tailored sleep pants he was wearing until she was sinking to her knees, and dragging his pants down with her so they were pooled at his ankles.
	With tearful hugs goodbye, Hermione left Grimmauld place mid-afternoon after only spending one night.
	Early next morning, Hermione marched down to the Quidditch pitch, mind whirring.
	The rumpled scrap of parchment in its claw was from Molly, inviting Hermione, Severus, Charity, and Eileen to the Burrow for lunch.
	Hermione stumbled to her feet and threw her arms over his shoulders, weeping with all the grief and loneliness and despair she'd kept at bay for a week.
	Hermione sobbed and gasped through her teeth as she shakily tried to roll over.
	Mrs. Granger shifted in her seat.
	Andy mouthed a 'thank you' to Hermione who smiled at her and shrugged.
	She thinks Hermione is mysterious?
	"Right you are, Miss Granger," a thick voice croaked from the wardrobe, and her stomach lurched.
	You’re the one who decided to throw it all away and soulbond for love anyway.”  Pansy sounded so disdainful it was almost difficult to believe she’d insisted upon being one of the witnesses affirming and supporting Hermione and Draco’s soulbond.
	Hokey took the bouquet from Hermione and disappeared.
	Hermione gave a wan smile as she massaged the potion into Tonks’ skin to reduce the swelling.
	Hermione shuddered and tried not to sob.“What spell?
	Hermione asked.
	She set down Dumbledore's note on the side table and turned her full attention to Hermione.
	"But I'm better," he calls over his shoulder, walking over to kiss Hermione on the cheek before settling himself in front of the fire, leaving Theo to stare at his back from afar.
	Hermione said nothing.
	Hermione pulled her up off the floor and held her tightly.
	Ron and Hermione arrive next, both in work clothes after being drawn away from a weekend home improvement project — each of them gives Harry a weighted look, but he looks away, doesn’t respond.
	A wicked grin crossed her features when Hermione got even more adventurous.
	[Cuts to Hermione at the most recent rose ceremony, looking glum.]
	Hermione nodded.
	They all separated, and Hermione leaned back still perched on his lap, “I understand.
	"Hermione?"
	“Nor have I,” said Hermione, “but I know the theory.” If Harry’s Trace was back on, which was the only explanation that Hermione could come up with that made any sense to her rattled mind, then the only safe place to go was somewhere they could not follow.
	Hermione bites her lip.
	Hermione frowned, hoping that she'd acclimate to being non-magical soon.
	Explaining that to Hermione had her eyes light up in actual delight.
	“It was quite deep,” Madam Pomfrey said, making Hermione start; she hadn’t realised the woman had resumed paying attention to her.
	Hermione bit her lip and tried to restructure her plans.
	Lighting his way with the jar, Sirius swam down in search of Hermione, fighting against the current that tried to carry him away.
	"What's up, Hermione?"
	Theo nodded happily, ripping off a piece of crusty bread from a loaf Hermione had lain across a haggard tablecloth that Daphne suspected had been placed there for her benefit.
	“I don’t know.” Hermione tried to pull her face free, but Lucius dug his fingers under her jaw, gripping the bone painfully.
	As her orgasm dissipated, Hermione ripped her mouth from his to suck in a lungful of air.
	Alphard took Hermione hand and rather flamboyant bent over to kiss the back of it.
	The fact that Hermione was the person attached to the problem was a coincidental nuisance.
	Hermione sat on her bed, twisting her hand back and forth as she flexed her fingers.
	“Immobulus!” Hermione flicked her wand and a jet of blue light filled the room, halting the Nifflers in various poses, all headed towards the same goal.
	Hermione slid down the wall.
	Hermione's body was moving before she'd even fully opened her eyes, pushing up into a crouched position that had her ready to either fight or flee.
	Everyone missed you so much, and they said we had to wait for Hermione, but she took a long time to remember you.
	It almost took Narcissa’s breath away to hear how astutely he’d diagnosed the problem, and how completely he’d rejected the pureblood belief system in this brave new timeline she and Hermione had created.
	Hermione groaned into her pillow, chastising herself for letting her mind wander to places she couldn't follow.
	I've an excellent palette," she said with a lofty glance at Hermione, tongue slipping out to brush over her painted lips.
	“Stop it,” Hermione warned, again.
	“Yes,” Hermione said and smiled.
	Speaking of distractions," Hermione said, sliding out of his embrace and turning to the books.
	Miss Granger looked delectable this evening.
	Harry, Ron, and Hermione send their best wishes as well.
	And Hermione wondered what Ron was most upset about; that Ginny was going to the Ball with Michael or that she wasn't available to go to the Ball with him.
	He teased her nipples into rigid peaks once again until Hermione was nearly gasping as she struggled to hold still.
	She gave a lurid wink at Lucius before twirling her wand around in her fingers and pointing it at Hermione, almost teasingly.
	Hermione had been walking with Harry and the other Slytherin forth years to class when she was hit in the back by a tripping jinx.
	Ron stepped forward, snapping, “Get away from Hermione.”  “Ron, she was just excited to see Crookshanks,” Hermione said exasperatedly.
	Afterwards, dressed in clothes that fit him for the first time in his life, they went to a book store, larger than any library Tom had been in, and Hermione handed him a stack of books with a quiet murmur, “you will like these.” Perusing them briefly, he agreed with her assessment, and gave a polite “thank you,” because that was the charming thing to do, and Tom had made up his mind to thoroughly charm the two Bonneau women.
	Hermione let out a silent breath of relief.
	“It’s not their fault you know,” Hermione said quietly.
	Crumbling under the weight of intrigue, Hermione found a quill and parchment and penned a quick reply.
	Hermione paused and met Theo’s eyes, jutting her chin up.
	Iago lifted his head and rubbed his whispered cheek against Hermione's face, the first semi-affectionate gesture Harry had ever seen the furred menace give.
	“You have absolutely beautiful skin, Hermione,” she whispered, leaning closer to her.
	Hermione’s eyes widened and she swatted at Sirius’ arm.
	Hermione was seated next to the head of the table.
	“Got your wand all right?” Hermione asks sweetly.
	As for you two,” he said to Neville and Hermione, “since I have no personal contacts with your families, and you have technically been cleared by Professor McGonagall, I shall not inform them.
	Hermione looked back up the stairs.
	Ron was leaning against the kitchen counter, and they were talking seriously when Hermione entered the room.
	Bellatrix began to read, her voice low and soft and Hermione smiled gently.
	Cruel as Bellatrix could be, she did not even hear Hermione's wails for mercy over her own excitement.
	"It's all about genes, Hermione," Harry began patiently.
	Hermione had thought that seeing her unexpectedly in this setting, dressed like this, would garner a more useful reaction.
	The basilisk let out a guttural sound, then rushed through the entryway, breaking through it rather than opening it as Hermione was sure Riddle would have done.
	Ginny and Harry were flanked him on either side while Hermione sat nearest Ron, opposite of Ginny.
	Truthfully, Harry is surprised that Hermione follows Ariana’s order and rests for most of the morning.
	"Slave labor," said Hermione, breathing hard through her nose.
	Hermione was first to show her bounty: with one yank on the strings of her backpack, she produced an entire pallet of food and water.
	Hermione had carved them into the trunk when she and Harry were here, tiny little script.
	Hermione paced nervously, she was to meet her grandparents on her mother’s side today and she hoped that it would go well.
	“Well, sure,” Harry says, “but — ” He stops, looks at the wan exasperation on Hermione’s face and the badly hidden wince on Ron’s, and bites back, It’s different when it’s me.
	Hermione wrinkled her brow, looking down at her wedding ring.
	The car lurched to a stop and Hermione felt her head lurch with it.
	Then hands the rat to Hermione.
	Hermione was in Slytherin green.
	"Every citizen of the wizarding world deserves an education," Hermione said, hands waving.
	Hermione had gotten up early to head over to the Burrow, leaving a disgruntled Sirius behind.
	Hermione gasped, realizing that Trix was here.
	Snape had been wrong about him wanting to turn Hermione into Narcissa.
	Hermione turned to engulf him, but he pulled away.
	"I'm surprised to see you here," Hermione said tentatively, attempting conversation as they walked.
	Slowly, Hermione's doubts seemed to ebb, left only with a trace of curiosity as to who she really was, the enigma wrapped in elegance that was Narcissa Malfoy.
	Harry sounded dismayed and Hermione slumped against the wall of the alcove, suddenly feeling very drained.
	Hermione: [surprised] "Oh.
	Hermione asked skeptically.
	"Harry, go tell Sirius that Mundungus took the locket," Hermione requested, panic rising in her chest.
	Black, I met your Patriarch for the first time roughly six months ago,” Hermione informed him coolly.
	Hermione turned her head slightly and complied to his demand, she licked Theo’s finger before she grabbed his wrist with her hand and took control of her movement.
	Outside the door, Ginny was silently chuckling, but Hermione was shaking her head in disapproval despite the warmth she felt at overhearing Harry have such a sweet family moment with his godfather.
	Hermione squeezed her hand.
	Hermione looked at the pale wizard, sitting a foot away from her on his massive canopy bed.
	"Ah," Hermione began.
	"Big fan, I'm Fred Weasley, a friend of Hermione's."
	"Oh gosh, sorry, I'm Hermione," the woman supplied, shaking herself of her momentary daze, "I just—" A pause.
	Hermione stares out the window, passing miles and miles of rolling fields and hills.
	The girls were hugging now comforting each other in anticipation of Hermione's death.
	“I do not!” Hermione protested, though her indignation was spoiled slightly by the moan she made when Patience’s fingers lightly traced her areola, making that sensitive skin instantly respond by hardening.
	She drew in a shaky breath and inclined her own head, before spinning on her heel and running to where Hermione lay on the floor, ignoring the gasping creature that was still lying on the floor.
	He didn't think Ron liked Hermione that way or thought of her as a potential girlfriend, but he wanted to check his assumption with Ron personally, along with getting Ron's permission to change the dynamic of the friendship the trio shared, because if Harry and Hermione dated, it would change things, Harry wasn't naïve to that.
	Hermione gave a quick nod and a thin smile.
	Hermione: [blushing] "Oh, no, actually, it isn't.
	"I will miss Hermione Granger.
	"It's not your fault Hermione, you tried to get them out.
	Hermione steadies her breathing.
	As soon as the boys were out, with the exception of the twins, Mrs. Weasley and Hermione sat down together on the couch and chatted happily.
	Hermione glared out the window and muttered darkly under her breath.
	Cedric asked, moving to stand next to Hermione as he realised what they were discussing.
	“Especially for my first time,” Hermione giggled.
	“Whoa, Bella that’s too much,” Hermione tried to cover her plate but Bella swatted her hand and continued to pile on the food.
	Vinda began to chant softly as she started at the crown of Hermione’s head drawing runes onto her skin.
	When her body finally became convinced that there was absolutely nothing in her stomach left to expel Hermione crawled into bed and cradled her head in her arms.
	“I’m here too, Hermione.” Hermione moved her head as though it would help her work out what was going on.
	Hermione took an interest in the flowers, as Bellatrix knew she would: her friend had a keen interest in herbology, after all.
	It didn't exist when she got there, Hermione explains, but now that she's there, she can make things.
	Hermione, I love you.
	Hermione let out a breath, then decided total honesty was the only way to build trust.
	Hermione tears her eyes away, finally meeting his gaze.
	He touches the book and he shows up inside it, and there's nothing, but Hermione's there.
	She had gone to help clean up after the party, but a determined Mrs Weasley refused her assistance, so Hermione thought to retire to the library.
	Harry blinked, a touch startled– he was well aware that Filch put up with him because he was Hermione's best friend.
	Hermione went slightly red.
	Hermione swallowed, watching him, reading him.
	Hermione swirled her hands through the bath bubbles and closed her eyes.
	Hermione bowed her head and turned to younger girl.
	Hermione explained the ongoing problem with finding her animagus form and her internal debate on whether to use the potion.
	George wasn't even halfway up the stairs when Ginny was given her task of decluttering the downstairs of the house while Hermione was to put fresh linens out for Mr and Mrs Delacour.
	Hermione frowned at their twin expressions of glee.
	Hermione Granger may have been the most determined and capable person Draco had ever met, but this wild-ghoul chase had been doomed from the start.
	With the determination of a mother-bear, Hermione Granger gritted her teeth and gathered every ounce of strength within herself.
	“Yes, Hermione,” Snape snapped, and Hermione dipped her head, chastened.
	Hermione asked, sounding amused as she lounged back against the headboard of the four-poster.
	Hermione could already feel the painful memories start to resurface.
	Glancing at her watch, Hermione groaned.
	"Hermione and I made a promise to keep you out of trouble," Ron said.
	Hermione repeated the thought in her head like a mantra as Lucius closed in on her.
	Unfortunately he miscalculated Hermione’s indignation slightly.
	Hermione thinks she might have been lying as the next words out of Mrs. Weasley's mouth towards Hermione were warm and through a genuine smile.
	Hermione felt herself rather torn about how this made her feel.
	His right hand, Hermione noticed, had yet to leave the pocket of his robes.
	Harry asked politely as he quickly took up a position by Hermione.
	asked Hermione.
	Hermione happily went with the topic and they were in the midst of a spirited discussion about the origins of runic magic when Ron showed up along with the rest of the Gryffindor Quidditch team.
	Hermione, he returns.
	Hermione's mind was furiously running through possible ways to sneak into the Chamber of Secrets sooner rather than later while Draco brooded next to her.
	Tom rolled his eyes at Harry's statement but Hermione found herself nodding in agreement.
	Not in the mood to start a fight, Hermione simply glared at the woman and sat at the head of the table furthest away from the older witch.
	As they came back down from their mutual high, Hermione’s hands trailed up his back to tangle in the short locks on the back of his head.
	"There will never be anybody better than you, Hermione," Fred says fiercely.
	She woke up really upset and she insisted we go check on Hermione.
	At one point, Hermione had found herself wondering if this was what having a parent was like.
	Without stopping to look back at him, Hermione moved into her bedroom and slammed the door.
	Hermione, for her part, swallowed hard but offered little resistance after shifting a little to allow Bellatrix to lift the pyjama top over her head.
	Hermione peaks around the corner.
	During those three weeks, Hermione developed morning sickness.
	"Well," Hermione said, thoughtfully, "I didn't exactly tell Harry I liked him, so much as I showed him by sticking my tongue in his mouth."
	I am not," Hermione shushed.
	I’m losing my mind.” Her voice was a rasp and Hermione drew in a shuddering breath.
	Harry said to Ron and Hermione.
	Hermione nodded tightly, but didn’t move.
	Hermione glanced at Bellatrix, wondering how much the older woman wanted to share.
	“I figured that you’d might want to see what occurred after you left.” Was all she said before resuming her place at her desk, leaving Hermione to delve into the memories at her own pace.
	"Look, you have a lot more questions to answer," he said, turning back to not-Hermione.
	Hermione squeezed his hand gently and he turned to smile at her, grateful for the support.
	Hermione shook her head.
	It was a full minute before Hermione felt like her brain was back inside her body.
	Harry swung his legs off the desk and moved into the one closest to Hermione.
	She turns to Hermione.
	His lips brushed the underside of her buttock, and Hermione’s knees gave out.
	His eyes slid to hers, and Hermione’s stomach jumped into her heart, a rush of desire overtaking her senses.
	Emma Granger smiled.
	Hermione nodded, she knew that but she hoped that it wouldn’t be too long before that changed.
	"When has Miss Granger ever threatened or hurt someone who hasn't wronged or threatened or hurt Harry?"
	"We can't defend the school while we search for the Horcrux, Harry," Hermione said stubbornly, turning her eyes from Viktor and Charlie to her friend.
	Unable to use her last line of defense, Hermione felt herself panicking.
	She looked up at Hermione, making quick eye contact before looking away.
	Hermione sat on her bed a foot away from him, her hands in her lap, her eyes downcast.
	It chilled Hermione's blood to think of a threat that had been so close to her and yet she'd been entirely unaware of it.
	Thirty minutes later, they were no closer to finding her a dress and Hermione's frustration was growing.
	“Rumours of my death were exaggerated.” A ripple of laughter ran through the students and Hermione wiped at her tears as she chuckled.
	If the sheer memory of it locked Draco in a trance, one worse than when Harry had started to say Voldemort's name, Hermione didn't want to know what Bellatrix might have done to Draco in their sessions.
	Daphne abandoned her experiments with magic sensing and joined Harry at one of the many hundreds of other mirrors, followed moments later by Hermione.
	Hermione’s gaze was otherwise occupied by the best feature of the bedroom.
	Hermione stared in astonishment and Theo’s smiled grew slightly crooked.
	"Come on, Dobby," Hermione urged.
	But the two aurors could put together that she would be the closest person to Hermione outside of Professor McGonagall.
	“For Miss Hermione.
	“I – I wouldn’t have thought anyone was paying any mind to me, though it is satisfying to think that somehow I might have distracted the other team’s Seeker, allowing Harry to score!” Hermione joked.
	The last door was swung open and Hermione was actually surprised.
	"Hermione," Harry gasped, and she turned to see him looking from her neck to the blood on Sirius.
	"Granger... you ok?"
	There was an intake of breath from behind him as he climbed over the paddock fence and he heard Hermione swear under her breath.
	Hermione agreed.
	Hermione gave the man a sad smile.
	He said the word ‘before’ with a great deal of emphasis, for Hermione had shown every sign of making a scene.
	Hermione's face fell, realizing what she'd just done.
	Hermione kissing her all the time?
	Hermione's mouth felt dry.
	Peter and James followed soon after and Sirius and Hermione were curled up in front of the fire, his hand running along her ribs.
	Hermione loved old books like this: the musty smell, the artful leather binding and how the edge of the pages were seemingly gilded as well.
	Hermione gritted her teeth and pushed until she flopped back into Arthur's arms once again.
	Hermione was quite unimpressed, but at least she wasn’t terrified about having two teams of snatchers on their trail.
	Hermione nodded and made a note in her mindscape.
	Granger greeted him by name.
	Hermione felt as though her skull had been crushed.
	Something's wrong, Hermione thought.
	"Well, this is cozy," Hermione joked.
	"You look beautiful," Hermione smiled at her friend, fingering the delicate material as the woman sat down beside her.
	"If anyone can figure out how to balance the two, it would be you, Hermione."
	“Gross.” Hermione shook the thought out of her head.
	"My dad has always been a passionate man," Hermione smiled in spite of herself.
	Hermione stared at the bed she hadn't slept in last night.
	Please save me from this, Hermione tried to telegraph to him.
	"Yeah," he said, "if that's OK with you, Hermione?"
	“I am…touched, Hermione, that you want my love.
	"Oh, Miss Granger.
	"And Hermione Granger and Sirius Black .
	“Hermione?” Harry whispers.
	"I wonder if you might settle a debate for us," Albus said to Granger, enclosing the three of them in a Muffliato once Eileen vanished into the house.
	“Please, Remus,” Hermione whimpered, parting her legs.
	Hermione: "Yes, Harry?"
	"I send Hermione back in time September of 1998," Remus explained.
	Hermione put her hands to her forehead, covering her eyes.
	Something on your mind, Granger?” Hermione brushes chalk off herself as everyone looks between her and Harry curiously.
	"Um, pardon me," Hermione spoke up.
	"But Granger, honestly, you keep doing this to yourself, you know?
	“Calm down, Hermione,” he said rolling his eyes.
	Hermione narrowed her eyes and McGonagall cracked a smile.
	Something is so— Hermione!
	For a moment, Hermione felt a bit angry, until she realized that Bellatrix was projecting thoughts to the creature to make her seem to be a more enticing target.
	Hermione blushes but she doesn't disagree.
	Hermione: [shouting back] "I want justice, Lee!"
	Hermione sprinted for the gates, meeting Pansy as she did the same.
	Hermione asked, intrigued to know more about her new Housemates.
	"This is painful," groaned Hermione to Daphne under her breath, watching from the far side of the room under the invisibility cloak.
	When their lips parted slowly, with great hesitation, Hermione smiled.
	"Hm," said Hermione.
	"I don't know," said Hermione.
	“The potion hasn’t worn off completely has it?” Harry asked, Hermione just nodded as she tried and failed to get ahold of herself.
	"Hah," Hermione chuckled.
	“How having you been fairing Miss Granger since the battle of Hogwarts?” The reporter interrupted.
	“Granger, this cannot possibly be more frightening than riding a dragon.” He was quiet while Hermione clung tenaciously to her part of the broom handle.
	The door shut, and Hermione startled.
	Hermione whispered to herself.
	Hermione had started taking Padma foraging with her.
	Hermione pleaded.
	Hermione finally asks, raising her voice above the others.
	Hermione’s stomach lurched when she understood.
	They did get a few strange looks, but he and Hermione were always next to each other, always by the other's side, and no one actually commented.
	Hermione was in her first official week as an Unspeakable, and she was the only recruit to have come straight out of school.
	"Miss Granger, I've already told you," she said kindly.
	Hermione exhaled in satisfaction.
	At least, not until, "Granger?"
	The girls said their goodbyes and Hermione found herself sitting alone in the Forbidden Forest.
	There were moments when Hermione felt his eyes on her back, in class, or in the corridors.
	Hermione looked back to Percy and Ginny and smiled.
	He spent what felt like a small, perfect eternity lavishing her most intimate parts with attention, and Hermione lost track of just how long he pleasured her, slowly bringing her to a climax that washed over her in shuddering ripples that built to a tidal wave.
	He turned to Liam, who was once more looking at Hermione with a curious expression on his face.
	Ron supplied helpfully, stepping up to stand close to Hermione in support.
	"Hermione Granger," she rasped out.
	"If anyone can figure out how to balance the two, it would be you, Hermione."
	But they couldn't have — Hermione had told him she'd send him word through the fake galleon, just like they'd done in the DA, if that were the case.
	Of course, that was before quidditch practice, and before Hermione’s epiphany, her newfound ability to see magic… he was drawn from his musings quite suddenly, by the feel of someone unzipping his pants.
	"You are as lovely as ever, my dear, and while there were many great things about Hermione Granger, these two," she said, gesturing to Remus and Sirius, "were absolutely pathetic in your long absence."
	"It wasn't Neville's fault," Hermione said immediately.
	Hermione twitched and looked away.
	When Narcissa came to stand beside her, Hermione lifted a tiny cat that looked like a cheetah with too-large ears.
	"So, Ron thought you'd come straight back to the tower after the loyalty vow with Nott," Hermione started to explain, "and when you didn't, he started to think maybe Lord Nott had done something, or Theo had done something or…" she gestured weakly in Harry's direction, "someone had done something."
	Hermione grinned and leaned forward until her breasts were pressed against his chest.
	Slashing his wand through the air, Severus cancelled Granger's spell.
	Hermione, you romantic dork.
	Over the next few days, Harry and Hermione forgot entirely about the outside world as they lost themselves in the bliss of their new relationship.
	“Sorry, Granger.
	Hermione’s gaze had settled on the huge, copper claw foot tub that was patinaed on the outside.
	Hermione believed that it would work now.
	Hermione shuddered.
	Hermione's cheeks flamed, and she slapped a hand to her mouth.
	As far as she knew Draco had refused to accept Hermione beyond what was needed to survive the mating heat.
	New glasses are perched on his nose; stylish frames Hermione had convinced him to buy for his birthday.
	Hermione resists the urge to give her a look, knowing that would be a bad idea with this many people around.
	At the front of the tent, Hermione dutifully held her bouquet of white roses and glanced from her impassive husband back to Ginny and Harry.
	And I always appreciate mint over bollock-flavored Hermione.” “Your eggs are ready, Miss Granger.
	Hermione shook her head and rubbed her face as it grew hot.
	Hermione ended up spending quite a bit of time dancing with other people, which was something, he supposed, but somehow Harry still ended up standing with Ron bemoaning life, the universe, and everything.
	Hermione smiles.
	Hermione perked up and grinned to herself.
	Hermione took a hesitant drink.
	Outside of Slytherin Manor, away from Death's soliloquy, down at the bottom of the hill, Dan Granger sat down with Emma on their comfy living-room sofa, while their daughter and Lord Slytherin sat in the two armchairs opposite.
	Come, Miss Granger, there is very little that goes on in this school that I am not aware of.” Hermione heard a quiet chuckle from over near the Headmistress’ desk and glanced over.
	"Good luck, miss Granger."
	"I might not be a good person," Hermione murmured back.
	Hermione let the unanswered question hang between them but when he added nothing further, she decided to press him.
	Later, Ginny had confided in Hermione that being close to Harry in that way was the only thing that had saved her from her grief over Ron’s death.
	Nothing should have bloomed in Cokeworth, but Granger's garden was flourishing.
	She might call Draco her son and watch over Hermione, but fundamentally she would always choose Lucius first.
	Parvati’s dark eyes appraised her and Hermione could tell she was unconvinced.
	Ron and Hermione turn up in the hospital wing to see how Harry is, just as he’s pushing away his almost untouched dinner.
	Tom, on the other hand, took to Thaddeus’s broom with ease, and Hermione caught more than one begrudging grin from the corner of her eye as he flew by.
	Hermione swallowed the bitter taste in her mouth, and tried not to cringe or express her discomfort.
	"Idon't feel the need to—" he stops, thinks back on Hermione's words.
	Can you blame him?” Hermione shrugged nonchalantly.
	He wanted to be the hero (or at least an anti-hero), and Hermione considered that serious progress.
	"It's a pleasure to meet you," Hermione said with a subtle curtsy.
	Hermione was almost afraid to ask.
	Hermione was so glad the picture of her awkwardly standing behind Harry didn’t make it.
	"She helped, yes," Hermione said.
	“Babd said something else to me, in the Maze,” he told her quietly and Hermione felt her face drain of blood.
	“That’s when it occurred to me, Miss Granger.
	"You don't have to look at me like that, Hermione."
	“I’m so sorry,” Hermione blurted out as she set Castor down.
	Hermione shoves into her again, screaming with years of built up rage, watching as she falls back towards the pool, feet skidding for purchase on wet stone and mouth open in shock.
	Hermione lunged for the album but he deftly avoided her and lifted the book higher as he skidded towards the door.
	Hermione crawls down to kiss her stomach.
	Hermione was moaning something, but she didn't know what she was saying anymore, moaning and begging alternatively, not even sure if she wanted these intense feelings to stop or continue.
	Turning back to Hermione she let out a twitter as Hermione stood there looking at the marks the tacks left in her flesh.
	Hermione looked at the floor and pressed her lips together to hide her smile.
	If Hermione was having a day like today, Draco and Narcissa must be swamped as well.
	"But then…" Hermione began worriedly.
	Perhaps it was his vision quickly deteriorating, but it looked as though the Hermione Harry was angry about something-something George was trying to settle her down about.
	"Look," Sirius leaned forward, his eyes intent on Remus, "you have other obligations now than our original plan to make sure Harry grows up and has the opportunity to elope with Hermione and have a lot of grandchildren none of whom will be called Quaffle."
	Is that right, Hermione?” The smile--that fucking perfect, arrogant smile--finally snapped Hermione back into action.
	He shook her hand and said, "I'll be in touch, Miss Granger.
	She consoled herself that she would see Hermione soon.
	"Because muggleborns aren't exactly looked on nicely by all wizards," Hermione said, her lips pressed tight.
	Hermione had been the outspoken odd-one-out.
	Hermione couldn’t help but giggle behind her hands; her mind recalling all the locker-room stories the red head girl told her about the goings on when the brooms and bludgers were being tucked away for the day.
	Hermione smiled, her hand now brushing against the lapel of his jacket.
	With his cock not completely deflated, despite ejaculating, Draco only paused long enough to pull on his pajama pants before he grabbed his wand and headed towards Granger's rooms in the Manor.
	Hermione asked.
	Hermione understood the rationale, but years later the decision still hurt.
	There is nothing normal about a horcrux to begin with, Hermione.
	Who had been there at Kings Cross to show Hermione and a few of the other Muggleborns that year how to get on to the Platform an hour beforehand so no one would be afraid or stumble into the wrong pillar.
	Bellatrix still had the upper hand, pressing her back and back until Hermione was defending herself with her back against cool stone.
	He wondered how much of this was due to the use of a wand channeling the magic, as opposed to the spontaneous, full-body magic he and Hermione were capable of wandlessly.
	Harry thinks some fractured thoughts about that as he kisses Draco, remembers something about Hermione and communication being important and then forgets it again, forgets he ever thought it.
	"That would be SPAW, now SPEW," Hermione pointed out.
	Hermione leaned against him, eyes closed.
	As with many of the new species suddenly appearing, Hermione and Bellatrix had always been credited for the discovery.
	It felt like home, and Hermione couldn’t fight it with her logical mind, she could only close her eyes and rest her head against Tom’s shoulder.
	But the ones inside do, went unsaid even if Hermione knew that’s what the woman was implying.
	Sunday morning Draco was there with Madame Bernard, and the older woman thought it was the perfect opportunity for Hermione to test her skills and try to plan an imaginary party at the Manor with Draco.
	Hermione found that both the touch and the words were surprisingly reassuring and reorienting as she floated back up into herself.
	Hermione nodded wordlessly then smiled.
	A flash went off to their left, and Hermione turned to see Bozo chronicling their drinking.
	"You're a witch, Granger.
	Hermione took several deep, ragged breaths as panic crawled over her, thick enough for her to choke on.
	She flattened her hands on the counter in front of Hermione.
	That lead him to Hermione confused about what year it was— I loved writing this chapter because it was a lot of relationships; especially between Hermione and those who are important to her-Harry (and Ginny), Ron and Dumbledore.
	Hermione stood before her in a bridesmaid's dress that was covered in aggressively orange satin roses.
	Hermione picked at one of her cuticles.
	It was a slow, time-consuming task and Hermione figured it was deliberate.
	They vanished before either woman could retaliate and Bellatrix helped a chuckling Hermione up from the floor.
	They had just finished cleaning it that morning, and Hermione found herself appreciating that for the first time she did not worry about eating in the house.
	When dinner ended, Ron beckoned to Harry and Hermione, and they slipped out after him.
	With a slow, almost reverent kiss on the fabric, Hermione peeled them off.
	Hermione gasped and tangled her fingers tightly in his hair.
	Twenty-two-year-old Hermione Granger stared back.
	Hermione: "Yes.
	Hermione still attends Hogwarts.
	Hermione's attention was jerked quickly away, however, as the crowd fell into a dead silence when Snape spoke loudly.
	Hermione said almost accusingly.
	Hermione looked at Draco's hopeful expression, with his truthful, pointed features and bright, wide eyes.
	Bellatrix falls into the chair next to Hermione.
	Hermione blushed.
	“Miss Granger, the portkey departs in one minute if you can possibly tear yourself away from the repetitive embraces of your friends.” Severus’ cool, disdainful voice invaded the tearful party like a bucket of ice water.
	He would not allow Hermione to try to engage his deeper affections or distract him from his devotion.
	Hermione: "The war was catastrophic, Harry.
	Hermione just continued to stare so Harry moved on.
	Hermione sighed.
	It was a singular connection that Hermione and Harry enjoyed, a connection that their other close friends would never understand.
	"Now, Miss Granger, you may call me Healer Pomfrey."
	Hermione flinched.
	“Shall we go to Hermione?” Patience asked, her tone a cheerful sing-song.
	One or two idiots who still haven’t worked out what you did for us all, but mainly…” Hermione trailed off as she saw the flash of pain in Bellatrix’s eyes.
	There was only a minute or two left till midnight as they arrived at the floo room, and Hermione didn't waste any time throwing a handful of floo powder into the large fireplace.
	“I love you, Hermione.” Hermione woke with her face buried in Bellatrix’s neck, strands of her hair tickling her nose and making it wrinkle.
	Hermione could feel her heart racing as she looked around the room that seemed to be shrinking around her.
	“You are quite impossible.” She pressed another chaste kiss to Hermione’s lips and then drew back.
	Hermione's fists clenched.
	Hermione woke exactly three minutes later on the hard ground where she had fallen.
	Ginny had told her all about the adventures she and Harry had enjoyed in Greece, and Hermione had just filled Ginny in on everything that had happened at Hogwarts — the interrupted wedding, Bellatrix’s return, and the hasty marriage to Snape.
	Hermione pursed her lips grimly: this was no time for sleep.
	He swept within a breath of them, and it took everything in Hermione not to shrink away.
	And third – and, frankly, most alarming – Malfoy emerges from under Harry’s own invisibility cloak, followed in close succession by Blaise Zabini and Pansy Parkinson, of all people, and appears to try to fling himself bodily in front of Ron and Hermione to block the spell, only managing to jar Hermione and shatter her shield charm as he barrels past her.
	Hermione shooed him back while she got her trunk into the compartment and he sprang forward again to help her, levitating the trunk up to the rack and sheepishly musing he should have done the same with his own.
	"I think we could be friends," he finished, "I like you– I think you're clever and I think you're kind; Hermione explained the meanings behind those flowers you sent her to me.
	"I..." Hermione found her hands lifting to rest on Bellatrix's waist and suddenly they seemed so much closer.
	"I feel like I should be feeding her," Hermione said, frowning.
	He lives with Luna these days as kneazles are banned from muggle areas now, but Hermione is still ostensibly his owner.
	Hermione tensed, her arms tightening around him in a suddenly crushing grip.
	“Well…maybe I did miss you,” Hermione quietly admits.
	Maybe Ron would get together with Lavender, maybe he wouldn't; but it was not for Hermione to decide and she felt lighter without it weighing on her.
	In the bad you’re.... Something is hovering over you and you’re…” Hermione halted as she felt her eyes well up; the dream had been so real this time.
	Harry whispered and Hermione felt her breath catch in her throat as she waited for Tom's answer.
	"I need you to send an owl to Mister and Missus Granger.
	I mean it, Healer Granger."
	"Well, that is one thing we don't have to worry about, at least," Hermione declared, rising to her feet with her empty bowl in hand.
	Hermione chuckled and, after a split second, Bellatrix joined in.
	Hermione nodded, looking over at Sirius.
	He was happy to be holding Hermione.
	McGonagall's gaze flicked skeptically between Hermione and Draco.
	"Hermione?
	Don’t put your hands up,” Hermione snaps, stepping in front of him.
	Hermione Granger had not been an easy student, and they had often been at loggerheads, but he would not deny the result this day that had made itself so plain.
	A new editor was announced at the Prophet, and Hermione almost spilled her coffee on an article that read slightly critical of General Jacobs.
	Hermione yawns back.
	"Promise me to take good care of my niece, mademoiselle Granger.
	Hermione took another sip, and he watched her.
	"Morning," Hermione mumbled, sliding her hand across the sheets until she felt the bare skin of her husband's chest beneath her fingers.
	When was the last time you’d seen her without Padma or Lavender?”Hermione blinks.
	Hermione nodded slowly.
	Tugging his hair, Hermione pulled back, her eyes half-lidded and her hair a halo of dishevelled curls.
	"I told them I was going to ruin them," Hermione shrugged playfully, though her smile was sharp and cruel.
	Hermione shakes her head.
	The name 'Hermione Granger' appeared on each and every one.
	He hadn't told a soul that it had been an exchange for Hermione's safety.
	Hermione took another deep drink of her champagne.
	She dropped her curl, brushing the backs of her fingers against Hermione's breast.
	Hermione smiles.
	Harry and Hermione look over to him, where he's staring at a destroyed wall.
	Protection and insurance, Hermione remembered his earlier words.
	Hermione had spent half an hour panicking about their absence, and Draco's health, until her guilt found her.
	Hermione and Filch constantly stopped to chat when they crossed paths and both of them seemed to think the burgeoning romance between their cats was beyond adorable instead of terrifying.
	Hermione felt incredibly light, as if her worries were floating away, and her mouth widened into a smile that made her cheeks ache.
	I can't believe I have to do this," said Hermione out loud to herself.
	Hermione spends some quality time with Ginny, although conversation is never too far from the subject of Bellatrix.
	Harry, Ron, and Kreature all looked at Hermione in their frozen state of a struggle.Harry, clutching a frying pan stared at her while  Kreature, with his arms outreached as though he had been trying to scratch out Ron’s eyes, looked most aggrieved by her handiwork.
	"Fleur, Hermione is still young, they don't know—" "Probably," Hermione says, lifting her head, cutting Bill off.
	Hermione’s wide eyes shot to the woman walking beside her but Bellatrix didn’t look at her; her eyes were fixed on the castle ahead.
	“Is she alright?” Hermione asked, leaning closer as if she wanted to approach the prone wolf but fear held her back.
	Harry looks to Hermione.
	"I don't think you'll be able to anymore," Hermione shrugged as the whimpering, crying heap of a man.
	Hermione stiffened.
	Hermione looks at her watch.
	Hermione shrieked as he wrapped an arm around her waist and bent her backward before he proceeded to snog her breathless.
