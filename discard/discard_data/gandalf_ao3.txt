<|endoftext|>That was when he noticed Gandalf and Thorin over at the other side of the Prancing Pony.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There were mercenaries watching them, and Bilbo almost sighed with relief when Gandalf sat next to Thorin, scaring them off.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked over him with a thoughtful eye.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He shot a pointed look at Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf asked.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"I've wanted to go on a quest since I was a fauntling looking for elves in the Westfarthing woods, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Now, Gandalf mentioned a Thrain, I remember that being the name of King Thror's son, was it not?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He had very nearly invited Gandalf as well, in a moment of what could only be called insanity - but he was a Baggins, and a Baggins must be courteous, after all - though thankfully the wizard politely declined.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had left the inn, no doubt off to see about making sure they weren't followed, that or some wizarding business of his.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You surprised even Gandalf."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It would be better just to have Gandalf let me know."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I'm sure Gandalf might have given you one, but the Big Folk aren't as familiar with the ways and paths of Hobbits.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thinking of maybe some Durin family feels time for Thorin's part, and maybe lots of Bilbo avoiding Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Why did he and Gandalf have to be in Bree?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf has enlisted my assistance in the aid of a band of dwarves who wish to save their mountain from a dragon.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>At any rate, I believe Gandalf means to pass through Rivendell on our way, and I should very much like to meet Lord Elrond the elves that so often I sought in the woods.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He hadn't quite expected to see Gandalf just as he was opening the door to go out.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"To visit my grandfather, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Imagine if Lobelia got Bag End" He shuddered at the memory of it, and Gandalf chuckled at him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked quite touched by his words.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Indeed not, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"I am only a hobbit, Gandalf."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Startled, Gandalf could do nothing but nod.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No Gandalf, I earned my wisdom through my years.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You really blame yourself, but Gandalf is a convenient scapegoat.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And since Gandalf appeared as well, I would like you both to sign my will as witnesses as I am going on an adventure and do not know if I will return.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked on, quietly amused.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The Old Took led them into his study and both he and Gandalf witnessed Bilbo's will, after reading through to making sure it was all in order, and they left his grandfather to read the letter in peace, then made their way up to Bag End, where Bilbo invited Gandalf to come and have a little afternoon tea.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Watch that chand-" But Gandalf had already hit his head off of it, and Bilbo smiled a little secret smile, because no matter what universe he was in, and no matter how many times he might have to relive everything (and by Eru he hoped it was only the once) there were some irrefutable things that would always stay the same.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>By the time Gandalf came to tell him that the dwarves were on their way, Bilbo was ridiculously over-prepared - and also dreading every moment because here it was, really, truly happening all over again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Ah, morning, Gandalf."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"I have been so very lonely, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But Gandalf had stopped his scrutiny, and that would have to do for now.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He gave Gandalf a wry smile, which the wizard managed to return.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Why, Bilbo, surely you don't mean Gandalf?"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Gandalf means you.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"There is nothing in madness to be proud of, Gandalf."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf smiled, like he thought that was an excellent idea.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf took his leave, and Bilbo could breathe at last.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf whispered "He's here" and made to stand up, but Bilbo shoved him none to gently out of the way.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Though I expect old Gandalf here could tell you all about my great uncle Bullroarer Took.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And by "they", I mean Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf, on the other hand, was frowning thoughtfully in the hobbit's direction, though as of yet, he just smoked on his pipe and said nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>he asked, with a pointed look at Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked up at him sharply.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Very well, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf, you know where your room is, since it's been there almost as long as you pestered my mother with adventures."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Besides, I do believe Gandalf looks as if he wants a word with me.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And after everything Bilbo had faced, he shouldn't be so frightened of Gandalf, should he?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf told him, sounding very much like he was trying to gently scold the hobbit into spilling all of his secrets.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But Bilbo had known Gandalf for too many years to be put off by such tactics.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Respectability is overrated, my dear Gandalf."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf bowed his head and made his way to the room especially made up for a Big Person.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He heard Gandalf's chuckle from where the old wizard leant against the wall.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You take care of yourself and that missus of yours, now, Hamfast.” he told him, and turned to where Gandalf was keeping a-hold of Myrtle for him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I'm only glad I never went outside with it on – can you imagine?” The dwarves beside him, and even Gandalf who brought up the rear chortled in laughter.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“My dear Bilbo.” Interjected Gandalf, a frown worrying at his bushy grey brows, “You speak of hobbits as if you are not one of them.” in his excitement of getting along with most of the dwarves, he had almost forgotten that Gandalf was there.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Hardly, Gandalf, dear old fellow.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ah well, at least I'll have good stories to tell the fauntlings at parties if I come back.” Gandalf raised a bushy eyebrow, but said nothing further.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I'm not sure that Ma hadn't planned it just to keep me out of her way for the day.” He looked up to meet Gandalf's gaze across the campfire, and saw that the old wizard was smiling now.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There's nothing quite like a party under the midsummer stars with a wizard's whizzpoppers to enjoy.” Gandalf chuckled warmly at the memory, before coughing a little on his pipe and answering.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I'm assuming that's what dwarves call Gandalf?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I am prone to forgetfulness now and again.” Gandalf answered without actually really answering properly at all.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Oh yes, I met Gandalf as a fauntling, but we'd all heard stories besides.” Bilbo answered with a smile.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“There was no “whisking off” muttered Gandalf, somewhat indignant.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“All they needed was a nudge out of the front door.” Bilbo, who was well-aware of what Gandalf's “nudges” consisted of, believed none of it, but did not argue beyond a disbelieving snort.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But when he was a little hobbit, there was nothing to suggest that he might be something other than an ordinary Took lad, and he'd never felt the need that his brothers and sisters did to go on adventures.” Bilbo paused, and his eyes slid to Gandalf, “not until, that is, a certain Wizard came along and convinced him that every Took ought to go on at least one.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“'ere, Mister Gandalf, can't you do something about this deluge?” Dori asked, clearly put out by the water soaking through his clothes and into his skin, despite the cloak.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Are there any?” Bilbo interrupted, not wanting the dwarves to feel like they needed to argue the point further with Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“What?” Gandalf turned to look at him, blinking the rain out of his eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I mean, I know there's at least two more, but no more than that.”
“Then you know more than many,” Gandalf said approvingly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He might have boxed your ears, Gandalf, hard to reach or no.”
“Yes, well,” Gandalf continued, “I think Radagast is a very great wizard, in his own way.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Evil, Gandalf?” Bilbo found himself questioning.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Hmm?” Gandalf asked, seemingly not paying much attention.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“A farmer and his family used to live here.” Gandalf muttered, frowning as he explored the ruins further, having dismounted his horse.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Perhaps it would be best to move on.”
“Yes, hmmm.” Gandalf said, “I believe that would be best.”
“And where would we go, wizard?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf!” he exclaimed – quite indignantly too, for it was quite rude amongst hobbits to knock someone over and fail to apologize – “What has Thorin done this time?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I go to seek the company of the only person around here with any sense.” Gandalf replied angrily.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Well what about hobbits, you daft old goat?” he questioned the air where Gandalf had been.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Typical stubborn idiot.” he muttered under his breath, and before anyone could tell him how much of a terrible idea it was to interrogate Thorin about his conversation with Gandalf, he marched up to the dwarf and did right that.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And if Gandalf says he has knowledge that we need, then we should listen to the wizard and you, Thorin Oakenshield, should learn to swallow your pride.” His piece said, Bilbo walked back towards dinner.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf!” Bilbo exclaimed, before frowning, looking as disappointed as he possibly could.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And when exactly, Gandalf, did you mean to appear?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo had to work quite hard not to smirk at Gandalf's expense, for he could feel the wizard frowning at him even as he hummed thoughtfully to himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Well, no matter, it seems that you've done well enough for yourselves.” Gandalf eventually decided, before changing the subject.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo was glad to have come into the cave if only for the look on Thorin's face when Gandalf told him that the sword he was holding had been made by elves.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Though if you're planning a stealth attack, it wouldn't be very practical.” The dwarf snorted, but remained on guard, until Radaghast came through with his “Thieves, fire, murder!” And Gandalf greeted his old friend.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo watched uneasily as the wizards conversed, and when Rhadagast told Gandalf of the blade he had found, the hobbit had to bite his cheek to stop from reacting visibly to its presence.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Who did you tell?” Gandalf demanded.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“This really isn't the time, Gandalf.” Bilbo scolded.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf found the secret entrance, which the dwarves did not see, and they assumed he had abandoned them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Elves.” He turned on Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Welcome to Imladris, though in the common tongue, it has another name.” Gandalf told him, eyeing the hobbit with some concern – after all, he had seen the little outburst earlier as much as the dwarves had.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf returned the elf’s greeting, and Bilbo was about to pipe up and do the same (it was only polite, after all), when they heard a hunting horn in the near distance, signalling the arrival of Lord Elrond and his hunting party, who came cantering in to surround the dwarves.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was sure at one point he heard one of them say Sevig thû úan, and really, he was about to respond when Elrond started speaking to Gandalf, and ignore the dwarves completely.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Would you make a liar out of her, now that she’s dead?” From where he stood next to Gandalf, Elrond turned in surprise, only now noticing the hobbit.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It did not take them long to arrive in the hall where Elrond and Gandalf already sat, deep in conversation.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Though by the time Gandalf arrived we had already dealt with them.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf handed over his sword first.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“This is Glamdring,” Elrond told them as he turned it reverently in his hands, “the foe-hammer, forged by the High-Elves of Gondolin, my kin.” He then handed it back to Gandalf, who took it very carefully.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Lord Elrond was not among them this time, but Gandalf was, and Bilbo found himself effectively cornered by the wizard whilst the dwarves made merry – though not as rowdily as at dinner.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“My dear Bilbo,” Gandalf began, in a tone that made Bilbo wonder whether he was worried or proud, “you have more than surpassed what I might have expected of you.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I’ve no doubt you will have need of them in the times ahead.” Oh Gandalf, Bilbo thought, you don’t know the half of it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I’ve been meaning to practice my smoke-rings, and I have a feeling that Nori may have pocketed what little pipeweed I had left.” Gandalf chuckled and dug into his robes to hand the hobbit a small pouch of pipeweed, which was very definitely Old Toby by the smell of it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Thank you, Gandalf.” He took out his pipe and puffed away.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And Gandalf had claimed Dain was the less reasonable one?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He didn’t want to wake you, but Gandalf said it might be better if you were there, to um…”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Once he was sorted, he and Fili joined Thorin and Balin, who seemed to be in a heated argument with Gandalf about something.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You have a map that you cannot read – Lord Elrond is millennia old and has forgotten more ancient Khuzdul dialects than any of you have ever learned, so it would be wise to see if there is anything he has to say on the matter.” Gandalf replied, his voice like that of an exasperated school teacher explaining to their pupil that no, they cannot hoard all the sweets, they have to be passed around the class to share.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It took a moment for Bilbo to realise that the dwarf king was waiting for his input on the matter, so he cleared his throat and both Balin and Gandalf turned to him curiously.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf, dear friend, you’d do a lot better at convincing people of things if you stopped talking down to them all the time.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Moon runes.” Bilbo and Gandalf translated together, before glancing at one and other in surprise.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“An easy thing to miss” Gandalf defended himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That remains to be seen,” said Gandalf, who turned to Lord Elrond to ask “Is there any more writing?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It didn’t hurt that they could eavesdrop on Gandalf and Elrond’s conversation from here, either.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Well, yes – that is I meant to tell you of course – but how did you know?” Gandalf was spluttering, seeming to have a little difficulty keeping up with Lord Elrond’s pace.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“But if we succeed!” Gandalf pressed, convinced that his course of action was the right one, as always.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It is a dangerous move, Gandalf” Elrond warned.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo could see from the set of Gandalf’s brows that the wizard would not take no for an answer.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“There is a strain of madness in that family, as you well know, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“All the same, Gandalf,” Elrond continued, “it is not up to you or me to redraw the map of Middle-Earth.” And after that they walked out of view and hearing of Thorin and Bilbo’s perch.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But Gandalf is also correct in that reclaiming the mountain would provide better defences to the East.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Why on earth he had ever said to Gandalf that he wanted to see mountains again was a mystery to Bilbo now.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Take up arms, fight!” Boomed Gandalf’s voice in the darkness, and Thorin had never been so glad for the existence of wizards.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“We must leave!” Gandalf told them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“There’s no time to give them anything better.” The older dwarves winced in sympathy, and Gandalf set the mutilated remains of the hobbits ablaze at once.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Before long, the dark caverns Gandalf hurried them through gave way to the light of a midday sun, and once they were clear of the caves, the entirety of the company collapsed gratefully onto solid ground.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Quickly now, all of you!” Gandalf echoed Bilbo's instructions, encouraging all of the dwarves into motion.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf, if you happen to have a miracle hiding under your hat, I would be most obliged if you might summon it!” Bilbo yelled over the trees, the panic in his voice utterly genuine.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Kili, Ori and Gloin were in the tree next to theirs, Nori, Dori, Gandalf and Thorin on the next, and Bofur, Bifur and Bombur in the last, furthest tree.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf, keep working on that miracle.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf!” He yelled, “how's the miracle coming along?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Dori, you can let Thorin go now, and Dwalin, make sure the Royal Idiot doesn't lose his head, in either the literal or metaphorical sense.” He didn't bother giving Gandalf any orders, for the wizard would do whatever he thought best, in any case.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They were about as good at being on time as Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Everyone, to the eagles!” Gandalf was shouting.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The eagle carrying Bilbo carefully set him down on his side, and trilled urgently in Gandalf's direction.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>At hearing this news, both Gandalf and Oin started towards Bilbo.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That, at least, is in my limited power to heal.” Gandalf spoke, and muttered something ancient and unintelligible to the rest of the party, and before their eyes, the wound closed, though left behind a scar any dwarf would be proud of.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Thank you, Master Oin.” Gandalf said to the healer with a small nod of his head.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Come, Gandalf, I would thank the eagles for their timely aid, and may need you to translate – I do not know their speech the way I do the ravens.”<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>But then there’s Rivendell and even though he has no personal quarrels with the elves, and the beds are a blessing, he could do without having to sneak out, in the middle of the night and using Gandalf as a diversion as if they were all thieves, as if they were like Nori – Nori must enjoy it though, outsmarting the elves –.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>By the time they do make it down the dreadful thing – those blasted birds – they all but drop their things, lay down in small groups –he finds Bilbo squashed between the princes and the hobbit seems rather comfy – and let exhaustion take them while Dwalin and Gandalf take first watch.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf, why didn’t you tell them?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I, well, assumed Gandalf had told you.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo frowns again, concerned this time, and Gandalf’s smirk wavers.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I don’t know if it’s dangerous though,” he looks at Gandalf at that, “not where other races are concerned.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He receives a reply not three weeks later with Bilbo’s answers to each and every doubt of Gandalf’s and his grandfather’s.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>After that is only a matter of asking the right hobbits: Mirabella goes – mostly to make sure this dwarf of Bilbo’s is good enough for her favorite sister’s only son – and nobody can stop Dodinas and Primula from going with their mother, and of course there’s Fortinbras, trying to look bored with the whole thing but clearly very excited at the prospect of travelling; on the Baggins side, he counts Linda, Bilbo’s aunt, and Falco, a cousin; Gandalf makes the sensibly invites Hamfast Gamgee, who agrees after some coercing from his wife.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf knows one of them holds a bead that associates him with Thorin’s Company, a simple golden thing with a tiny ruby incrusted on it, and the other one holds a gift from the King himself, one of two silver beads that bind them together as partners.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They part when they reach the room in which Gandalf will be staying, Bilbo needed at a meeting between elves and dwarves and the wizard in need of rest after his journey.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Soon enough the others appear, taking a momentary detour to greet Gandalf, Bilbo and Ori being the last.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It is long after they have finished eating that Gandalf brings himself to share his findings on a certain matter.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Because you make it sound a lot like an addiction and those can be very dangerous.” The prince chances a glance in Thorin’s way and Gandalf understands perfectly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf keeps a close eye on the Company while he stays in the mountain and indeed it could all be far worse.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo laughs, the now ever-present glittering intensifying for a brief moment, and he can believe Gandalf’s story about the possible addiction.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The first ones to offer them are Dis, Dain and the hobbits – and Bilbo looks ecstatic at Hamfast’s seeds and Primula’s blank book – and later come Gandalf, Bard, Beorn, Thranduil and Radagast.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>Those Big Folk who were lucky enough (or irritating enough; we’re looking at you, Gandalf) to learn a bit about Hobbit culture usually came to the understanding that Conkers was a game named for the horse chestnuts used in the game (themselves called  conkers ) and that the object of the game was to break an opponent’s conker without breaking your own.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo Baggins didn’t think even Gandalf (meddler that he was) knew that he was called Mad Baggins by the rest of Hobbiton, seen as odd and unHobbitish and not overly liked by any but his Took and Brandybuck cousins.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Perhaps if Gandalf had known about Mad Baggins and Hobbiton’s gossiping problem, and perhaps if he had visited at all within the last decade, he might have known that Bilbo had been the reigning Conkers champion for three years running.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Of course, besides Gandalf, some of the Rivendell elves, and a few Rangers, no one knew that Conkers was more than a faunt-game, if they even knew that much.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He probably knew Gandalf even better than that path and he had no doubts the wizard intended to drag the dwarves, kicking and screaming if necessary, into the city of Imladris.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He had agreed to their quest readily enough once he knew the reason for it, but only after tearing into Gandalf like a rabid fauntling.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo wasn’t entirely certain Gandalf was fluent in the language of the Shirelings, although he surely knew at least some words.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He imagined Gandalf would have been put off had Dwalin turned him into a pancake with that massive warhammer of his.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>For a moment, Bilbo let the possibility roam about his head and considered bringing it up with Gandalf later to make a point, if he ever decided to speak to the wizard again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo had  missed  Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ah, but Bilbo was a sentimental old fool even at fifty and Gandalf a wizard who didn’t have time to pander to silly hobbits.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sat against a cliff wall away from the majority of the dwarves, puffing on his pipe as he watched Bilbo return his empty bowl to Bombur.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The two didn’t talk, as Gandalf had hoped they might.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The tweenager Gandalf remembered had been insatiable when it came to his curiosity, and nothing would stop him filling the holes in his knowledge.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had to concede that it had been many years since he had last seen Bilbo Baggins.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf wondered idly what else of Bilbo’s he might have broken by staying away so long, and if any of it could ever hope to be prepared.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>A bit of a touch on Gandalf here, some of Bilbo's past, and we see Bilbo being friendly with all of the ponies.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>His feelings for Gandalf were of a slightly more vindictive manner, and he watched in amusement as rain ran off the rim of the wizard’s pointed hat.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You started yelling at Gandalf in some strange tongue.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yes, I was speaking Hobbitish.” And that answered the question of whether or not he had been cursing Gandalf out in his native tongue.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“After your grandfather’s reign as Thain, they’re expecting great things from Fortinbras,” Gandalf said from the front of the party, proving that his ears were irritatingly functional.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gerontius,” Gandalf answered, not giving Bilbo any time to even think about changing the subject.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Oh, it would be easy to stay mad at Gandalf, but exhausting and ultimately pointless.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Old Took used to tell me stories about traveling with Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf laughed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf huffed and puffed as he usually did when he was feigning one insult or another and turned back around to continue leading the party while pretending that it was Thorin leading.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo was distracted by Ori asking “Who will be the Thain after Fortinbras?” and in answering “Ferumbras III,” forgot that he had been considering flicking a pinecone at Gandalf to express his irritation.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>This was apparently of interest to Gandalf, since the wizard came trotting over eagerly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo breathed out a sigh and reminded himself that he couldn’t stay angry with Gandalf forever, no matter how tempting.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was watching him sedately and Bilbo didn’t think he was imagining the sadness in those blue eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“A wise idea,” Gandalf said, and he did that thing where he gripped his staff  just so  to indicate that he was about to go into a spiel of genius proportions.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It’s a pity I can’t take Myrtle and go speak to Gorbadoc now, but I’d be gone too long, I think, and I can’t imagine what Thorin would think of my absence.” Gandalf was giving him an amused look.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf chuckled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf huffed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“And good at Conkers,” Gandalf interrupted.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf hummed in agreement and handed over his pipe, which Bilbo pulled a few grateful puffs from.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf chuckled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“We’ll need all this rain to wash off this mud.” But he dutifully bedded down for the night, camping near to Gandalf, rather than close to the ponies as he had previously.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He wasn’t sure if it was something of a peace offering on his own part or perhaps he was worried that Gandalf said he would be leaving in the morning.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Obviously, he would be back with the oilskins, but Gandalf had said before that he would be back and then was gone for over a decade.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf did leave in the morning, letting his horse carry him beyond their sight swiftly eastward.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They were just crossing the Brandywine Bridge late afternoon when Gandalf met them on the far side.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I have the oilskins Gandalf said you needed here as well, but this is just for you.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I think she was relieved to see Gandalf finally show up.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He wore it during his own adventure with Gandalf, and then during his days as a Bounder, before he took over as Thain.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“We can’t have the next Master of Buckland disappearing with a group of dwarves,” Gandalf said, coming over to stand next to Bilbo.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thank you kindly, Gandalf the Grey Wizard, but I’ve been warned about you.” For all of Rorimac’s lecturing tone, he was grinning widely.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The dwarves were looking confused, Gandalf was looking flustered, and Bilbo was trying very hard not to laugh in the face of both.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Defenses?” Gandalf asked.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf harrumphed and after a moment walked off muttering about Brandybucks who mixed with Tooks and gave birth to dangerous combinations.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The rain continued on the following day, but Bilbo had passed out the oilskins to each of the dwarves and Gandalf had picked up one for himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No wonder Gandalf picked me.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo suspected Gandalf was surreptitiously leading them to Imladris, but he wasn't about to be the one to break that to the dwarves.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>At this point, Bilbo was just waiting for the inevitable blow-up, so it really came as no surprise, after they stopped at a burned-out farmhouse that made Bilbo nervous to look at, that Thorin and Gandalf got into a loud argument that had the wizard storming off.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They were close enough to Imladris at this point that Gandalf could get there and back before daybreak without too much trouble, never mind whatever wizardry he decided to use.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Just ask Gandalf.” He patted the dwarf’s arm.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We’ve only known each other a few days.” He studied Nori for a moment, then said, “But it was Gandalf that led you to my door.” As if that explained everything.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf, yes.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They divided it amongst the Company, minus Gandalf, who still had not returned, and searched the rest of the hoard.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Thorin found an elegantly-crafted sword that would suit himself, and a longer one that would fit best in Gandalf’s hands - far too long for any of the dwarves or the hobbit.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was a fool to bring you.” He turned away before anyone could say anything, but Bilbo didn’t even try.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“I don’t think Gandalf was a fool,” Kili admitted, and his brown eyes were huge and sad when he regarded Bilbo.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They decided not to wait for Gandalf, wanting to get away from the trolls in case there were more about.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>Gandalf had appeared a couple of hours later from wherever he had disappeared to the night before and did something that knocked Dori unconscious, which was just as well.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had gotten his arse torn into by a furious Thorin for not being there.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He'd not looked pleased when Gandalf had reminded him that he said not to cross the river until he was back with them to assist.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had checked over Ori, as well, and done some of his wizardry to make the dwarf breathe a little easier.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>His mind flashed back to Gandalf, before the wizard left again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Their argument had ended with Thorin feeling thoroughly angry with himself (which, if he was being honest, was also how the argument started), and Gandalf had wandered off to check on Ori, muttering words of magic under his breath that seemed to ease the scribe's breathing, and Nori's nerves.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had told him to wait to cross the river until he was there because the rivers in this part of the world are dangerous.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf didn't seem overly concerned,” Thorin said quietly, squeezing his nephew gently.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It'll give both the halfling and Ori time to recover, and Gandalf can find us easily again.”<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>Gandalf was right on time, appearing nearly out of the blue, as wizards tend to do.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf never liked it when he did that.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>After waving the smoke away, Gandalf raised an eyebrow.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stared at him for a brief moment, then chuckled softly and shook his head.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Oh, I do know the stakes.” Bilbo went to his door and opened it, gesturing Gandalf inside.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I have sensed it coming long, now.” He cast Gandalf a solemn glance.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s light expression fell.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Nothing Gandalf said came as a surprise, of course.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo vaguely remembered not getting nearly as much information the first time around, but it made sense Gandalf would tell him more now.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Then I will send them here,” Gandalf said, tearing Bilbo from his thoughts.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf narrowed his eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“One day, Bilbo Baggins,” Gandalf muttered, “you will tell me your knack of knowing what isn’t said.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“But that day is not today.” He stood, then took Gandalf’s cup and wiped the table.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That was where Gandalf found him some minutes later, sniffling and dabbing at his eyes with a kerchief.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Nothing, Gandalf,” said Bilbo, and gave him a smile through the tears.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Happy?” asked Gandalf, raising an eyebrow.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf nodded thoughtfully.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When he looked at Gandalf once more, the wizard was watching him intently.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Allowing a small smile, knowing Gandalf would never guess the truth, he continued, “you do not know the path that brought me here, nor what I’m willing to risk to continue on.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It had been his purpose, much more than his faded memories, that had made him spare Gandalf’s life when Gandalf had found his broken body.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Perhaps I do not,” Gandalf agreed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I do hope you have a plan, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf inclined his head.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Recalling it was that precise thing Gandalf had done his last life, Bilbo raised an eyebrow.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf bristled, but before he could come to Bilbo’s defence, Bilbo said, “with this,” and dangled the key to Erebor before the King’s nose.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf bore it into my dwelling,” said Bilbo, shrugging as he dropped the key.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf laughed heartily, clapping a hand to Bilbo’s shoulder.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf seemed highly amused at the whole commotion and was kind enough to entertain the other dwarves while Bilbo and Balin discussed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf soon followed him, bending nearly at the waist to get through the door.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo’s little hobbit hole had never been built with tall folk in mind, and truth to be told, he had never bothered to fix it – Gandalf could deal with a too-small house once every decade or so.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>After Gandalf had got himself seated precariously on the couch and Bilbo in the far more comfortable armchair, Bilbo raised his eyebrows expectantly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>With an airy sigh, Gandalf gave him a stern, though not unkind, look.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>If Gandalf had meant hobbit and not dragon, Bilbo might have said yes – though it was far from a given: there were bonuses with this hybrid form that he would be hard-passed to give up.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I’m a social creature, Gandalf, and the solitary life of a dragon, nomadic or not, isn’t one for me.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf smiled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“This is a curse-anchor,” Gandalf explained.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf nodded.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Again, Gandalf nodded.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It is by choice,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Magic,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That would be truly dire situations indeed,” said Gandalf sadly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yes,” said Gandalf, “let us hope.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Later, when Bilbo had retreated to his own room and Gandalf to his, he lay and listened to the song from the living room.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Have you ever seen the Shire before?” Gandalf asked.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf hummed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Well,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But say, Gandalf, are we friends?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“I am not,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Only one,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
When he sunk onto his knees in the soft grass of Bag End some time later – Gandalf had penned Belladonna and convinced her to take him in, as a ‘distant relative’ of Bungo – the scent of earth and life was so warm and sweet in his nose and mouth that he burst into tears.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Bilbo,” Gandalf exclaimed, “what is the matter?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“There are many curious about you and your story… stealing Gandalf’s key right before his very eyes is a mighty impressive feat.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The next day they pushed on – Bilbo chatting lightly with various members as they went – and when the sun begun to set, Gandalf rode up to Bilbo.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf nodded, and then, with a discreet look around, leaned closer.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Thorin, the fool, believes he owns me,” Gandalf stated sourly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Though he wished Gandalf would have stayed, he was glad he thought of telling him before disappearing.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf nodded to him, then slunk away, and not long after, he was gone.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was understandable – they’d been traveling the whole day with the most interesting thing happening being Gandalf disappearing, which wasn’t that interesting, all things considered.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>At one point, Gandalf showed up.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf rolled his eyes and sat beside Bilbo, who’d borrowed a pair of knitting needles from Ori.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Right,” said Gandalf, unimpressed, and stood.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf shot Bilbo a look, as though say, ‘was this really necessary?’ to which Bilbo could only nod.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Very well,” said Gandalf, and sighed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf seemed to understand, for he brought Sting with him back outside, offering it up with a raised eyebrow.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Huffing, amused, Gandalf asked, “will you tell me what else you know?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf paled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Then I shall gather the others,” Gandalf decided, and made haste for the cave where the dwarves were quarreling loudly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He shot Gandalf a dark look.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf appeared quite exasperated, sighing heavily.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Bilbo,” Bilbo grunted, from where he was cradled in Gandalf’s robe.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Amused, Gandalf corrected, “or Bilbo Baggins, as he now is.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Balin and Gandalf will accompany me.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He found himself fiddling with Gandalf’s necklace as he stood there, musing.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It was a gift from Gandalf,” he admitted.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo was the only in the Company who wasn’t too hopeful or excited about the upcoming trip, excepting only Gandalf, who seemed sterner than usual.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Thorin.” This time it was Gandalf who came to his rescue.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Can’t you see he’s quite comfortable where he is?” And with that, Gandalf came to sit by him, saving him from any other, awkward questions.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf asked, voice hushed, in Sindarin, “I thought you were a cold-drake?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf puffed his pipe and blew smoke in Bilbo’s face.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo was one of the first ushered in, and he stood nervously and watched while Gandalf scoured the place for anything off.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“If something’s wrong, Gandalf’ll know.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>In the end, Gandalf found nothing, and they settled in.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They lit no fire, but Gandalf took pity on Bilbo and let him sit close to his staff, which glowed faintly and emitted low heat.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>After expressing his gratitude to Gandalf, and with dull guilt gnawing at his heart, Bilbo went to sit with the dwarves.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Even Gandalf paid attention from the corner.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Would he collapse in exhaustion and beg Gandalf to end it all, now that his purpose was fulfilled?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He brushed against the necklace from Gandalf, and with only half a thought’s preparation, he ripped it over his head.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Though the transformation couldn’t have taken more than a few seconds – Gandalf would not have let it be a plan B if it meant Bilbo would be writhing in pain for several minutes – Gollum was nowhere in sight.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He lay aching on the floor for a while, clutching Gandalf’s necklace in one hand and Sting in the other.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They were gathered in a group, chattering and nattering on loudly – bugging Gandalf with questions like, ‘where’s the hobbit’ and ‘why don’t you know this’ and ‘but who saw him last!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s relief, however, was fleeting.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It is not that kind of injury,” Gandalf said, exasperated.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Nothing you should worry about,” Gandalf barked.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf,” he croaked, for he had heard something and smelled it even better, though he’d been distracted by his pain –<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf turned to glance at him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Run!” Gandalf cried.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo was acting on instinct, listening to the clues of the people around him, and when Gandalf yelled, “climb!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Thorin!” Gandalf exclaimed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo slid off the eagle who had carried him, muttering a hushed thanks into its feathers before he joined Gandalf’s side.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As Bilbo watched Gandalf work on Thorin’s wounds, the other dwarves gathered around them, worried and nervous.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Quite alright,” Bilbo said, before Gandalf could speak up.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
It was the beginning of winter when Gandalf, at last, took his leave.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>While he felt home and more at ease than he had ever done before, Gandalf was the one who understood him best.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf smiled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“But… oh, Gandalf, will you visit?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Of course,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Bilbo huffed and rolled his eyes and pretended he didn’t realize Gandalf meant it, and then he let him leave.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
And Gandalf did visit, at least once a year – sometimes only briefly, and sometimes staying for weeks.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo was glad to finally have earned his old friend’s trust, and – even after Belladonna and Bungo’s passing – easily decked for feast whenever Gandalf came by.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf always left.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf and Bilbo stayed at the shore.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They played around in the water for quite a while, Gandalf watching them with amused eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf only looked relieved.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sat beside Bilbo near the small fire, and they spoke in hushed Sindarin, to not wake or stir the others.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I will present you to Beorn before the others,” Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Then you shan’t take it personally,” said Gandalf, “and I will try to convince him to let us rest by him anyway.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The next day, Gandalf told the dwarves the same as last: to wait for his signal, and then come in pairs.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It’ll be alright, dear boy,” said Gandalf, and patted his head – the only place he could reach without it being awkward.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I am Gandalf,” said Gandalf, “a wizard.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf seemed to grow many years older just as they stood there.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No, naturally,” Gandalf hurried to placate.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Well, see, wizards can often tell if people mean what they say or not,” Gandalf tried to explain, “and I looked into his heart and saw he spoke true.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo had been quiet, letting Gandalf handle the situation.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They chased me off themselves, because I was not evil enough for their tastes – I was lucky I found Gandalf when I did.” He looked up at Beorn and met his eyes, usually warm honey – now nothing but cold steel.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There I have farmed and sung and laughed, and I have planted flowers and tended to animals and lived a homely, gentle life.” He paused, glancing at Gandalf, then back at Beorn.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf became impatient, but Bilbo knew this wasn’t something to be rushed, and let the great man think for as long as he needed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo was so relieved to hear he was accepted that he didn’t even bother to listen to the rest of the story, except for the few times where Gandalf asked for clarification on something.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“We heard Gandalf,” Bofur explained quietly, expression uncharacteristically solemn, “when he told Beorn about…” He stopped, searched for words.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was waiting for them back in the house.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That was unwise of you,” Gandalf said sternly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Sorry, Gandalf,” they all muttered, somewhat out of synch.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“What could possibly be so important that you would stray so far to speak of it?” Gandalf asked, hands on his hips and expression exasperated.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf paled, shooting the two dwarves hard looks.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Shaking his head, Gandalf muttered, “the day I trust a dwarf farther than I can throw them…” He raised his voice a slight bit.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It’s late.” They made to move past him, but Gandalf put a hand on Bilbo’s shoulder and held him back.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf,” Bilbo said, inclining his head.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Do you trust them?” Gandalf muttered.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Good night, Gandalf.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The others seemed slightly worried about the lack of Gandalf and Beorn, but Bilbo had a vague sense they were both fine and would return soon, and his reassuring placated the rest of the Company.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf gave me much to work with.” He cast a glance over his shoulder – back towards the house, where the volume levels were rising.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Beorn and Gandalf, however, were nowhere in sight.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo tapped Gandalf’s hand while everyone were busy, and when Gandalf glanced down at him with curiosity in his eyes, Bilbo gave a sheepish smile.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s curiosity flattened into worry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Naturally,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo took the offered vial when Gandalf handed it over.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf leaned a bit down and clasped Bilbo’s shoulder.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He tugged it up to rest it against his chest; Gandalf’s necklace was cold against his skin.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo was clutching at the Ring in one hand and Gandalf’s necklace in the other.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As Bilbo crept down the dark and empty halls of Erebor, he toyed with Gandalf’s necklace.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo raised trembling hands to his neck, hooking his fingers around Gandalf’s chain and lifting it above his head.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gasping and grunting, Bilbo fumbled for the vial Gandalf had granted him before Mirkwood – bloodied and scraped fingers sliding against the glass and leaving red-and-black fingerprints.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That earned him nothing but laughs and grumbles, and Bilbo resigned himself to having to seek out Gandalf as soon as he was healed enough to clamber down the battlement.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo held onto hope that Gandalf would show up soon.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Wait!” he called, pressing himself flat against the ground, “wait, it’s Bilbo, I need to – I must speak with Gandalf!”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I must speak to Gandalf,” Bilbo said, gesturing with his claws as he spoke.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“What ever is the matter here?” Gandalf huffed, striding forward between the ranks of men and elves.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I can’t turn back.” Pain flickered across Gandalf’s expression.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“But, Gandalf, listen to me – there are other worries approaching.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Then it is worse than I had feared,” Gandalf muttered.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Good,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was Gandalf who had told them, feeling it only fair to explain who they’d be taking in.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But Gandalf had not told them much: it was Bilbo who, by the second weekend, sat before the fireplace and told quiet tales of slavery and pain.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was circling above Gandalf when the dwarves – his dwarves, the Company, his Company – shattered the blockades and charged through.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Bilbo!” Gandalf called, and Bilbo flew lower, lower, lower – “How close is the last army?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo landed heavily when the battle was declared ended, searching for Gandalf in the scurry of dead, wounded, and living.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf!” Bilbo called, making his way towards him as fast as he could, mindful of his steps, lest he tread on a person.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Thank you,” said Gandalf, and gave Bilbo a once-over.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf shielded his eyes and looked about the field.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He handed him off to Gandalf with care, and Gandalf then ushered him on towards the elven healing tents that had already been raised.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s expression softened.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Yet he did not cease before Gandalf called him down.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf chuckled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“And Fili, Kili, Bifur and Nori, and Balin, too – as well as a red-haired elf,” said Gandalf with a smile.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf hummed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Well – no matter.” Gandalf brushed a hand over Bilbo’s side.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf brought the feather to his mouth and mumbled something in a language Bilbo did not recognize.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>With a smile, Gandalf put the feather back in place – and there was a strange sensation, like pinching reversed, and then Gandalf pulled back.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“There,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Well, and your hair, of course, since they are linked,” Gandalf said, with his typical half-shouldered shrug.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You are not,” said Gandalf, “and I would.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf found me, and upon my request, gave me a hobbit form and took me to the Shire.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was half-way done with the first mitten when Gandalf poked his head into the tent.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No, no,” Gandalf said, gesturing reassuringly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf raised an eyebrow.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“What do you want to hear, Gandalf?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Oh, dear friend,” Gandalf said, sagging in the stool and giving Bilbo a sorrowful look, “I wish I could console you, but…”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I only wished for you to be honest with yourself,” Gandalf said meekly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Away from here,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf raised an eyebrow.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I expected no less,” Gandalf said, inclining his head.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I was born a hobbit in September of 2890, the Third Age.” Gandalf blinked, then frowned, but made no move to interrupt.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You died,” Gandalf repeated, somewhat uncertain.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yes.” Bilbo fiddled a bit with the bedsheets, not looking at Gandalf as he continued.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was a thing hard to believe, and he so wanted Gandalf to believe him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And then Gandalf said, “hadn’t I known you, I would not have believed you.” Bilbo glanced up at him, uncertain – Gandalf was smiling, though.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf didn’t say a word when Bilbo wiped away a few stray tears.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“And with my help?” asked Gandalf, with a twinkle in his eye.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And afterwards…” Gandalf smiled a sad little smile.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf always left, in the end.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Chuckling, Gandalf stood.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Kili dumped Thorin onto the stool next to Bilbo’s bed, hissed, “you better not walk on your own,” and followed Gandalf outside.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“And that’s when Gandalf found you?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was Gandalf who called him to the first meeting.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Waiting,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Between who?” As he asked this, he all but ran out of the tent, Gandalf picking up speed to keep up with him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“A peace meeting,” Gandalf said calmly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>After running around like a headless chicken for a bit, Bilbo managed to calm himself enough to let Gandalf lead him to the tent where the supposed meeting was being held.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sat by the table, as well, right beside Bard on one side and Thranduil on the other.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was Gandalf who took the word first.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf nodded.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Children of the Green Lady,” Gandalf hummed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Before the table could erupt into grumbling and discussions, Gandalf loudly declared, “Bilbo and I will fix that.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Not on my own,” Gandalf said, “but with Bilbo’s help… we can lessen the effect.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s gaze flickered to Bilbo.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And so it came to that Bilbo went marching right back into Erebor’s empty halls, Gandalf by his side.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They trailed into the darkness, their path lit only by Gandalf’s staff and Bilbo’s good sight.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Ah,” said Gandalf, and his smile was apologetic.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It is of my own creation,” Gandalf admitted.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf gave him a peculiar look.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Oh?” said Gandalf, an amused smile hiding behind his beard.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It’s like drinking lava, Gandalf, did you never test it?” Bilbo asked, raising his eyebrows in mock shock.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf mumbled something incomprehensible, then hurried to turn away.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf left.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But Gandalf had said it was true, now that the anchor was part of himself).<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo wished for Gandalf often the upcoming days.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>“Gandalf came to Bag-End yesterday for the express purpose of inviting Mum on an adventure.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And given that you’re in dire enough need that you followed Gandalf to… what did you call it?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I may not be of age until autumn, but I haven’t been a child for eleven years, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I will not stay in that smial a day longer, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“If you think that my life has been one of ‘careless ease’, then I suggest you ask Gandalf how he spent the Fell Winter, or you could ask any of the Hobbits currently eavesdropping on this conversation how my parents died and I was wounded, or, of course, you could ask Camellia how many times she’s barred me in my room or withheld my meals because I was behaving too Tookishly for her tastes.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>So, Gandalf, you have a decision to make.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>While Kíli mounted his pony, the crowd began to shift as Thorin, Gandalf, and the others at the front of the line edged their mounts forward, but all thought of subtlety flew out the window when a Hobbit boy even younger than Belda flung something toward her; Fíli’s hand snapped out almost too quickly for even Kíli to see, then opened with a wince to reveal a largish rock with sharp enough edges to have drawn blood.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bits and snatches of yet another argument between Gandalf and Thorin reached them, and Belda sighed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf is taking us to the Brandywine Bridge as quickly as he can.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Well,” she bobbed her head, nearly clipping Kíli’s chin, “yes, because of them in that they, with Gandalf’s endorsement, furnished my means of escape.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She nodded to Gandalf as she named him, and he inclined his head to the Hobbit.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Anyway, as I told Gandalf earlier, after my parents died, one of my father’s brothers got custody of me, and he and his wife have been trying to make me into a proper Baggins ever since.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Carrots and mushrooms don’t count, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The Company don't realize that she can tell the difference between male and female Dwarves, so they're talking about Fíli like they would to a Man or an Elf.2) I hope it wasn't too confusing to have Gandalf think of himself as 'Olórin'.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Blinking at him, she realized that night had fully fallen, and that Gandalf still hadn’t returned.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Even Fíli and Kíli did it, and Gandalf never seemed to notice.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Granted, Belda still didn’t really understand why everyone pretended Fíli was male, despite Gandalf explaining it that first night before they rejoined the others.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Besides,” she looked toward the camp again, visions of herself rescuing the ponies and bringing them back single-handedly dancing tantalizingly at the back of her mind, with flashes of Gandalf’s proud smile, Dwalin’s gruff thanks, Thorin’s ready acceptance of her into the pack.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Despite his words, he didn’t look quite as sure as he sounded, and a spark of hope flared up, fanned by a faint, silvery scent that she would have recognized in the middle of a dungheap, though she wasn’t sure Trolls were preferable; Gandalf was back, and near enough for the wind, weak as it was, to carry a trace of him to her.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“The dawn will take you all!” Gandalf’s voice rang though the clearing, coming from somewhere above Belda, and she nearly collapsed with relief.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She was facing them, and therefore the Company, and she could see them clearly as they cheered Gandalf, grinning, other than Dwalin, who was justifiably impatient.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s scent, silvery and unlike any other, drifted over to her as she listened to him climb down to the clearing; he’d always smelled like rain, to her.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The fabric at the sides of her neck tightened slightly, and she opened her eyes to see that Gandalf was untying the sack, expression as dark as the Company’s; as soon as he had it loose enough, she pulled it down herself with her good hand, nodding to the Dwarves.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The Halfling was sitting where she had been since Gandalf saved all their lives, not a finger lifted for the Company, not even an attempt to ask if they were well.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She hadn’t taken any credit for delaying the Trolls until Gandalf got there, either, only said that she should have done it sooner.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I will not be responsible for the death of a child, Gandalf, and especially not a girl.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She’d been sure that Belda had just slipped off to help Gandalf or someone on the other side of the Trolls, but now she was starting to think that maybe he’d been right to worry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But regardless, Belda was standing just inside the treeline, and as Fíli watched, she flushed and ducked her head far enough down that Fíli didn’t think anyone but Gandalf, who was tall enough to see over the ponies, and Fíli and Kíli, the only members on the Company standing on the same side of Myrtle as Belda, could see the girl.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf and the other Man, Radagast, had been talking for several minutes, but Fíli and the other two were far enough from them that she couldn’t hear any of their conversation.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf and Radagast caught her eye as Tharkûn offered the shorter Man a smoke.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The Hobbit in question was nearly as grey as Gandalf’s hat, and the ponies shifted uneasily behind her as she looked toward the sound.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Warg scouts!” Thorin scanned over the Company as he’d taught Fíli to do when there was danger, then focused on Gandalf as the Man moved to stand near Bofur and Glóin and the rest.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>With more exasperation than she’d ever seen him have for anyone but Thorin, Gandalf rounded on the other Man.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Pointing behind him, Radagast was almost smiling as he moved toward Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“These are Rhosgobel rabbits.” For a split second, almost too quickly to see, Gandalf stilled; Radagast grinned.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Glancing between the Man and the rabbits for a moment, Gandalf finally heaved an irritated sigh and nodded once before turning on his heel.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Belda, already leading Gandalf, Thorin, and Fíli’s ponies toward them, nodded and gave a short, low whistle; her pony immediately picked its way through the herd to her side.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thorin and Gandalf mounted easily, but Belda had always had more trouble, simply due to how petite she was, and so Fíli sped things up a tad by simply lifting the Hobbit onto her pony as she had the day they all met.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thorin shouted for the Company to close ranks, and with the exception of Gandalf, they did; Fíli glimpsed Ori on the far side of Kíli, but wasn’t quite sure whether to wish he was closer or wish he was farther away.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>One of the riders rode toward Gandalf, who bowed as much as he could without dismounting.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Mithrandir!” The weed-eater looked as pleased to see Gandalf as Tharkûn was to see the Elf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I do not believe we have met.” Fíli had to hold back a smirk, imagining Thorin’s expression; the fact that Gandalf and Elrond had stopped on the opposite side of the circle from her meant that she could see Belda and Kíli out of the corner of her eye, which meant that she could see that Kíli was trying and failing to hold back a smirk of his own.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She and Kíli had both been uncomfortable with it, but at the same time, the Elf’s familiarity with her mother meant that he was in a position to draw her into conversation as no one else but perhaps Gandalf could.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Could he feel Gandalf's ring if he ever used it?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf and the leaf-lord were walking together, Dwalin and Belda behind them, both silent.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She couldn’t have gotten those injuries after he and the rest of the Company arrived at the campsite, which meant that she’d been squeezed and stretched, she’d been stuffed into a sack and tossed to the ground like so much refuse, she’d bargained for all their lives and won  time for Gandalf to arrive, she’d fetched the ponies and ridden for miles, all with those injuries.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Not when she fell after Gandalf’s theatrics.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Looking back at Gandalf, Dwalin made his decision; nodding respectfully to both Tall Folk (he owed the leaf-lord at least one nod for healing Belda, after all), he put a hand on her back and gently directed her toward the room as he explained, “Miss Baggins and I need to have a private word.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>After Gandalf arrived, I was wrong to be angry with you.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Also, he's calling her 'kit' because he's heard Gandalf call her that once or twice, as much as I love the idea of him just magically knowing what to call her.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Just after Gandalf untied us, I spoke to her, and she listed all the things she’d done wrong, she took responsibility for the whole mess, gave herself none of the credit, and never once let on that she was injured.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“She is my friend, but if I didn’t think she could handle herself, I would beg you to send her somewhere safe with Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“We need a Burglar, and Gandalf’s right, we can’t send Nori in, he’ll get eaten before he can blink.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf insisted that Belda would be invaluable on the Quest, and she was quick and clever, as Dwalin had said, and in more than just her fighting.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She had, he couldn’t deny, gotten them all caught by the Trolls, though unintentionally, but she’d been the one to save them, and more so than Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She was o-Khazâd, but so was Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was her Godfather, but the last month of travel had been the longest she’d ever seen him at a time, and she had a feeling that if she added up all the time she’d spent with him before her parents’ death, it wouldn’t even equal the month.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>If they’d been Hobbits, either she’d already be part of their pack, they’d have left her by the side of the road as soon as Gandalf dealt with the Trolls, or they’d never have agreed to take her this far.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>If I was, Gandalf would never have agreed to let me come in the first place; he knows how old I am.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But Gandalf did know her true age, and he’d been nudging Thorin toward giving her the contract for at least a week or so before they reached Rivendell.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Belda did her best to keep her thoughts off her face as she trailed after Elrond, Gandalf, Thorin, and Balin, but she wasn’t sure how successful she’d been.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Grief washed over her, remembering her Grandfather’s Midsummer’s Eve celebrations; he’d called Gandalf to supply fireworks once or twice when she was a fauntling, but by and large, she didn’t remember light-shows.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Elrond, Gandalf, and Thorin stood huddled around the crystal, but she just waited near Balin; even if the light hadn’t hurt her eyes, there still wouldn’t have been any point in getting closer, seeing as how she could barely see over the edge of the stand.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Surprisingly, Gandalf answered.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Balin turned back to Thorin, and Belda moved to stand behind Gandalf, where he’d block the light, as the elder Dwarf spoke.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She looked between all of them but Gandalf as she spoke, and kept doing so after she finished.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>More loudly than usual, Gandalf cleared his throat.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>After holding Gandalf’s gaze for another moment or so, he glanced at Balin and Thorin; stepping closer to the Wizard, Elrond spoke too quietly for Balin to hear, and took his leave as soon as he was finished.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But Gandalf answered, grimly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“They’d object to our course?” Balin had only asked for clarity’s sake, but was somewhat gratified when Gandalf nodded.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Though, if he was wishing, then he also wished that they weren’t in an Orc-cave, that Thorin hadn’t been so harsh earlier, that Gandalf had caught up as quickly as he’d said he would, that they didn’t have months of travel ahead of them, that they didn’t have a dragon ahead of them, and, most of all, that they were all already safe and settled in Erebor.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>At one point, the largest Goblin appeared, only to be slain by Gandalf, and the Company plummeted.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“‘Our Hobbit’?” Dwalin barely knew he was moving, but found himself standing before Gandalf somehow, breath harsh and rattling in his chest.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sighed sorrowfully, “Master Dwalin—”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“She was not YOURS!” Gandalf’s flinch back was the only reason Dwalin knew he was shouting; everything was getting strangely muffled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had given her Grandfather a pair of magic cufflinks, but all they’d done was fasten themselves and stay fastened until he gave the word.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She’d tell Gandalf in private, and he would know if it would affect Dwarves.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>In any case, it didn’t really change the fact that she needed to tell Gandalf about it, and to tell him, she had to hold onto it at least until he rejoined the Com—<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thorin, though, looked almost irritated, and Gandalf seemed dismayed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She was panting, slightly, when she finished, and both Dwalin and Gandalf seemed about to speak when her expression suddenly changed, going distant as she closed her mouth.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf barked, “How many?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The sound only seemed to rile the wargs up, and Thorin and Dwalin had to follow his Heirs’ example, as did the rest of the Company, all the way to Gandalf’s tree on the very edge of the cliff.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thorin had ended up on the same level as Kíli, on the opposite side of the tree, while Dwalin was a branch above Kíli, Fíli was above Dwalin, Nori and the Burglar were across from Fíli, and just above them were Ori and Dori, Gandalf topping the group.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Yells from further up proved him right, and he looked over just in time to see Gandalf catch Dori with his staff, Ori clinging to Dori’s leg.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Dwalin was yelling hoarsely at Gandalf, as he had been all the way down, but between him, Thorin, and occasionally Bofur, it was almost impossible to make out the words.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She and Kíli were at the tail of the group; he’d completely frozen when Gandalf turned around, Belda no more than a rag doll in his arms, and Fíli had needed his hand in hers as much as she thought he had.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As Gandalf called Óin loudly enough for even him to hear, Fíli tore her eyes from Belda and looked to her brother.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Dwalin swore, quite creatively, at Gandalf, as he set down Belda, and the wizard finally seemed to snap.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>For a few moments, Gandalf just stared at Dwalin, seeing what, Fíli couldn’t tell, but with a solemnity in his expression that she suspected meant he was considering more than the obvious.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf nodded grimly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf met Dwalin’s eyes evenly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He gave Thorin a brief nod, but his eyes returned to Gandalf and Óin almost at once.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bombur looked relieved; Óin looked satisfied, as did Gandalf; Dwalin and Thorin both looked as though they didn’t know whether to laud Kíli for his initiative or forbid him to venture out of sight, and Fíli wasn’t sure which she’d prefer they do.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf chimed quietly in, “The Eagles carried us some miles.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Fíli could only hope that Gandalf’s magic would be able to heal them, at least partially.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Fíli squeezed his hand reassuringly as Gandalf huffed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The wait until Gandalf could heal Belda was as bad as waiting for Thorin to give her the bloody contract had ever been.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The constant, kaleidoscopic barrage of scenarios where she walked off while Gandalf was healing Thorin, where the wizard didn’t catch her before she walked off after Thorin’s apology, where she simply succumbed to her wounds before anyone could do anything.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>By all rights, he should have shorn his beard the second Gandalf gave his diagnosis.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When the wizard knelt beside Belda sometime around midnight, Dwalin steeled himself to be told to move, but instead Gandalf looked at him, with such profound pity that Dwalin could barely breathe, and told him (quietly, but in no uncertain terms) to stay just where he was.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The healing itself was unimpressive; Gandalf held a hand over her, closed his eyes, said something in no language Dwalin had ever heard, and it was done.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was more than she’d moved in hours, and Dwalin couldn’t stop himself from grabbing hold of Gandalf’s sleeve as he began to stand.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf says someone needs to keep an eye on her while she sleeps.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That wasn’t a dream, dear girl.” Automatically, she tried to look toward Gandalf, but between her general soreness and the light hurting her eyes, she barely moved before subsiding with a wince and a hiss.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She did have more questions about where they were, how they’d gotten there, and so forth, but she was also spectacularly hungry, and Gandalf refused to answer her until she’d eaten at least one serving.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Cutting off Gandalf’s not-so-subtle nod to the unfinished serving, she crossed her arms dismissively.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Óin, watching as Bifur signed something, presumably what Gandalf was saying, since Óin’s ear trumpet was nowhere in sight, nodded emphatically.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The Goblins rushed us and I fell.” Gandalf’s eyebrow leapt up, but she tried to ignore him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>So I knocked him out.” She hesitated for a beat; she needed to tell Gandalf about the ring, but could she risk it affecting the Company like it had the Goblins?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thorin gaped at her, and the rest of the Company, even Gandalf, seemed just as shocked.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“The Orcs came, we ran, we climbed trees, Gandalf started lighting things on fire—”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf scoffed, but she saw the edge of a smile before Kíli distracted her, grinning.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thorin opened his mouth to shout again, but Gandalf’s voice rang through the clearing.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“So, after Thorin was needlessly and stupidly wounded defending his pride,” Thorin growled; Gandalf glared at both of them again, “I… that’s right, I ran down, too.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Oh, shut up, that's completely different.” Gandalf glowered at them, and she (reluctantly) refocused on her memory.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was a long moment before she was able to unclench her jaw, and her ear throbbed insistently for some time after that; ignoring it as best she could, she looked at Gandalf rather than face any of the Company’s confusion.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf cleared his throat.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Another two bowls of food later, Gandalf was nearing the end of his explanation; it might not have taken as long if the rest of the Company hadn’t interjected comments through it all, but she was too touched (and more than a little embarrassed) by their concern for her to be irritated.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There was something she was missing, probably something to do with what he’d asked, about if she’d heard the ‘words spoken’, especially since Gandalf’s account had skimmed over everything after he’d healed Thorin.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What aren’t you saying, Gandalf?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf hesitated.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No.” Belda’d been half-expecting Thorin to speak, but evidently Gandalf hadn’t, as he startled noticeably.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Distantly, he heard Thorin and Gandalf calming the others down and sending them away, but he was too focused on the girl crying into his chest to listen.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf didn’t even spare the king a glance.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf held up a hand.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf chuckled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But while he’d been lost in thought, her expression had morphed to confusion as intense (if not more so) as when Gandalf had questioned her.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thorin gaped at her incredulously; distantly, he heard Gandalf clear his throat delicately.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Her voice gave out, though she continued to mouth words for a moment or two; when he spoke, Gandalf’s voice was gentler than Thorin expected.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Slowly, dazedly, she met Gandalf’s eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf, I can barely put two words together; please, jus— tell them.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf frowned dubiously.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Well, wizard?” Gandalf glared at him irritably, but Thorin returned the look evenly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf opened his mouth to answer, but Dwalin did so first.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf gaped.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Smoothly, Gandalf finished his sentence.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What Gandalf was describing (and Dwalin, to a lesser extent), was that she’d essentially sworn fealty to him— or adopted his entire Company, depending on how he thought of it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was starting to see why Gandalf’s centuries weren’t enough to understand.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>With a startled squeak, she ducked her head again, a vivid blush spreading over her cheeks from ear to ear; Gandalf took it upon himself to answer, but Kíli caught Thorin’s eye as he looked to the wizard.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf!”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She’d memorized half the library by the time Gandalf came knocking.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf wanted her to go.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Her hands tightened on Dwalin’s sleeves as she glared at Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf relaxed, obviously pleased with himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Just as Belda was about to suggest heading east, Gandalf mused aloud, “There is a house… it’s not far from here.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Are they friend or foe?” She was tempted to reassure Thorin herself, but the panic in Gandalf’s eyes was too entertaining for her to rescue him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf hesitated.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Expression tense, Gandalf answered, “None.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She’d called Hobbits’ Ones ‘Mates’, she’d somehow persuaded Beorn, the shape-changer Gandalf had said was as likely to kill them as not, to help them, and Beorn seemed to respect her authority with the Company as Thorin would a fellow King.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Before she could respond to Gandalf, a huge grey-black dog came into the room.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And Gandalf was uneasy about asking Beorn for help, but you spoke to him for a handful of minutes and you persuaded him, and that’s not to mention the fact that you’re fluent in his language, and the way you are around him… you’re barely that comfortable with me.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I need to talk to Gandalf.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It’s time I followed through, and I think I’ll need Gandalf’s help.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf will.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She’d split off from Dwalin as soon as the house came into view, and found Gandalf in a handful of minutes (during which she gave Ori a quick heads-up), and he’d agreed to help her.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Now, Beorn’s animals were just finishing the rather laborious task of setting out dinner, and the Company was all in the main room, and she and Gandalf were the only ones lurking at the edges.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Finally, Gandalf smiled at her.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>After a moment, Gandalf tapped her on the head with his staff; she glared at him, but couldn’t deny that the interruption made it easier to think through a sentence or so.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>After the uproar had died down after dinner, she and Gandalf had both explained that Hobbits came formally of age at thirty-three; not just battle-ready, but legally adults.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You heard her and Gandalf, same as me,” Fíli hissed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I should’ve begun this Quest years ago, but if Gandalf hadn’t brought the key and the map to me, I probably would’ve died with it still unfulfilled.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“BOOKS!” Fortunately for Glóin, Gandalf walked in before she could strangle any of the oblivious Company.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf, they don’t even know what printing presses are— tell me the rest of Middle-Earth isn’t like this!”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Just as she opened her mouth to repeat her question to Gandalf, he gestured magnanimously to her.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>More civilly than she would have at the moment, Gandalf answered, “More than anything else in the world, Hobbits value food and cheer and song.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And my reasoning for that is in Gandalf's little summary.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf flicked his reins.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It took nearly ten minutes before she rolled her eyes at Thorin and Gandalf’s efforts and just rode ahead; half the Company nearly lost their seats as their ponies jolted into motion.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked over, expression concerned.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Óin spluttered incoherently; Gandalf cleared his throat.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Neither she or Gandalf had commented on it, which made him think it was probably usual for Hobbits nearing their coming of age.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You don’t mean to leave us, Gandalf.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It turned him invisible, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Magic rings aren’t so unusual, Gandalf, you know that as well as I do, but have you ever heard of something that enthralled people like that?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I can’t watch that happen to my pack, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She had no idea what to expect from the Mirkwood, despite all Beorn and Gandalf’s warnings.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Dwalin met Belda a few paces before she reached the Company—no surprise there—while Gandalf continued on into the camp proper.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf and Bilbo’s shared flash of Sauron is one of them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Belda watched Gandalf’s form shrink into the distance until it was too small to see, despite how the rising sun assaulted her eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The entrance that she and Gandalf had ventured into the day before was left quickly behind, and the forest proper proved to be a mass of twisting, grasping trees, cloaked with strangling vines and dark dense cobwebs, each strand as thick as her little finger.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She hadn’t expected to find anything to hunt in a place that Gandalf and Beorn both spoke so fearfully of, but having it proven so conclusively was still sobering.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He knew all sorts of stories about adventures, and he even liked Gandalf’s fireworks.” Eyes shining, she nodded to herself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But then, Gandalf had said something about that at Beorn’s, hadn’t he?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>—she’d promised Gandalf—<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But Gandalf had said that was just a Hobbit thing, how could that sound have been—<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>)3) I could write through leaving Lake-Town and tack on a temporary epilogue with Gandalf realizing she's a dragon.4) I could write through leaving Lake-Town and tack on a temporary epilogue with her and Kíli going to the Shire fifteen years after everything (Smaug and the Ring) gets taken care of.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I'll add a tiny Gandalf section at the end of that (probably just a drabble, but who knows, it might be twice as long as the rest), and then I'll do a proper epilogue as 'chapter fifty-seven', for now.I do want to stress, I am not abandoning this story.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Why now, Gandalf?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf, you don’t mean the Hobbit traveling with the Dwarves!”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf… she’s a dragon.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf, you can’t!”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“The power in Dol Guldur will only grow stronger if it is left, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No, Gandalf—”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>'), but then Gandalf and Radagast started talking and the next thing you know, I have to rejigger most of the entire rest of the story because now there's another wizard heading to Erebor.Notes: 1) There's a link to Belda's braid embedded in the story, if you didn't notice it before.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>6) Those of you who are *very* familiar with the movie will recognize the Gandalf&Radagast scene as one that happens before the Company even gets to Lake-Town, but since this is a combined book/movie timeline, I moved that up to now.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Travel time in the movies is basically zilch, so I just added a little more travel time for Gandalf and Radagast to get all the way to the tombs.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>8) Have you ever wondered what would have changed if Gandalf and Radagast had compared notes and realized Saruman was up to something?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And Gandalf was right, as well.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Where was Gandalf?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I knew Gandalf said you were on the way to Erebor, but I’d still thought you wouldn’t be here yet, not— oop—”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’ve a message from Gandalf for you— where did I put it?” He patted his pockets haphazardly, going from one side to another, up and down, inside and out, in no discernible pattern.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Knowing Gandalf, she really hadn’t expected any different.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I think you’re forgetting that I’ve been pottering around as long as Gandalf or the other Wizards.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You should know that Gandalf told me of your…” He lowered his voice, glancing toward the Company.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’ve no more interest in it than Gandalf has.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I believe you’ve been granted protection against it, from what Gandalf told me, which means—”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He's silly, but I honestly think he was trying to do his job, even if he wasn't as good at it as Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Honestly, with Gandalf having spent so much time with Nienna in Aman, it would make more sense for him to be the one who talks Belda down, but I really do like Radagast, and he was much more stationary than Gandalf, so I think it's reasonable that he would form relationships with the Woodmen in the area and still learn about people.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I would've had to pop Gandalf in just for this scene and then yoink him out again, and that's ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The more he considered the note Gandalf had sent from Rivendell, the more sure he was that the Wizard was right, for all that his father had dismissed it out of hand.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf is right.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You, Gandalf, you’ll go and stop Thorin!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I promise, next week will be back with the Company.Notes: 1) As you might be able to tell, my theory for why Galadriel didn't have any armor when they came to rescue Gandalf was a) they weren't expecting a full-on battle, and b) she kind of just dropped everything to help her friend.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“If Lord Elrond could be persuaded to speak to Thranduil, together with Gandalf, maybe they could make him see sense.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Maybe Gandalf or the other one?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Elrond and Gandalf seemed surprised.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>If Gandalf hadn’t come by that day, she truly didn’t know what she would have done.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Father.” Straightening, he let his eyes drift over the stranger before settling on Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The stranger shook his head, turning back to Gandalf and, in the process, turning his back to Losnyrn.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf shook his head, paying no more mind to Losnyrn as he moved closer than the stranger did.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Even at the simple question, Gandalf said nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>My wife and child are in this city, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Something else to ask Gandalf about, she supposed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stopped in the far corner of the room, the moonlight lighting him softly though he didn’t stand in a beam.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf, Thorin’s gold-mad.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“The Arkenstone?” Gandalf’s brows nearly disappeared into his hair.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gaze somewhere far away, Gandalf nodded.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s breath left him in a low exhale, his shock and his awe clear to see when she looked up.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He wasn’t just making it up, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Silently, Gandalf held out a hand.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>After another moment or so of examining the Arkenstone, Gandalf nodded.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But what Gandalf said made sense.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was right.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She was such a fool, she still wanted to believe that Gandalf was wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Shaking her head, she looked up at Gandalf again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She wouldn’t let the people she cared about die, either, like Bard and Rûna and Sigrid, Legolas and Tauriel, Gandalf and Radagast and Beorn.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Even as Losnyrn opened his mouth, Gandalf’s voice filled the tent.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As quickly as she’d looked toward him, Belda spoke over Gandalf in a swift explanation clearly intended for Bard and Rûna, though her glare didn’t leave Thranduil.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That name, he knew, but Gandalf and the Elves flinched as though they thought he’d appear among them at the summons.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bard couldn’t muster the courage to break the moment; Rûna seemed as speechless as he was, Gandalf and Rosteth watching the two combatants with ancient sorrow mixed with fresh hope.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“We are not your pets to be commanded, Mithrandir.” It wasn’t the first dismissal he’d tossed at Gandalf, but it was the most distracted.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Her words hung heavy in the air for long moments before Gandalf ushered her out, Rûna moving to follow before Belda said something quietly to her.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>After another half-hour or so, Bard dismissed himself as Gandalf entered, Rosteth accompanying him back to his family’s place.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Belda felt as though she’d melt away as she and Gandalf walked away from the tent, the purpose that had fueled her all the way from Erebor replaced with simple fatigue.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“What do you hope to accomplish with that?” Finding a bench near a fire, they sat, the small hop up to the Mannish level almost too much for her flagging energy; Gandalf helped her up, voice gentle.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf chuckled, though the sound was colored with sorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Belda nearly fell off the bench, Gandalf startling as well at Rosteth’s voice.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Rosteth’s head snapped up, eyes wide and disbelieving, but Gandalf nodded solemnly, confirming Belda’s words, and Rosteth turned back to her task, glancing up at Belda now and then as she listened.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Or without basis,” Gandalf confirmed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Mostly?” The concern in Gandalf’s scent was unmistakable, though more subtle in his tone.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf hummed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf cleared his throat.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was on foot in the distance, his staff and hat unmistakable even from so far away.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Kíli’s breath caught at the command, though he knew none but perhaps Gandalf would understand the Khuzdûl.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s roar—magnified as Kíli had heard from him when Dwalin had challenged him under the Carrock, and when he and Thorin had fought in Hobbiton—broke through the shouting and tore Kíli’s eyes from Belda as the Wizard stormed toward the prince.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Losnyrn turned to face Gandalf, but didn’t let go of Belda, dragging her around with him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Kíli couldn’t believe his eyes when Gandalf swung his staff at the prince with both hands, connecting with a crack that echoed over all the plain.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was nearly apoplectic, standing beside her, and Bard—just in front of her, from Kíli’s angle—just looked confused, but Belda—<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>3) I had Gandalf thwacking Denethor in RotK in my head when I wrote that scene, in case you can't tell (^u^)Russian notes: Part of me's inclined to just tell you to go back and check the earlier chapters, but I'll be nice.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Ironfoot,” Gandalf breathed, breaking her from her thoughts.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf set off toward the rider; with a last, terrified glance toward the gates, she followed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The effort of keeping up with Gandalf helped keep her mind on the task at hand, though he wasn’t running by any means.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>A sound left Gandalf, partway between a hum and a growl and a groan.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Belda snorted, Gandalf echoing her.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Dain sat back, eyes on Gandalf and Belda as they approached; Gandalf called up, “Come now, Lord Dain!”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf the Grey,” he drawled snidely, “And you’ve brought a pet!”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf banged his staff against the ground, cutting her off before she could respond.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As Dain’s eyes returned to him, Gandalf thundered, “A legion of Orcs march on the mountain, led by Azog!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Lip curling, Dain glowered at Gandalf, obviously bristling even through the armor.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Looking again to the gates for a long moment, he frowned again at Gandalf and Belda.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She felt eyes on her, and looked up to see Gandalf watching her with a small smile.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sounded older than she’d ever heard him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The Orcs were likely a foregone conclusion—he didn’t know the Wizard well enough to trust his word, but Belda clearly did, as did Rosteth, and that was enough for him to take Gandalf’s word far more seriously than he might have otherwise—but perhaps they wouldn’t come.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Perhaps Gandalf was wrong, after all.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The ground under them shook, and Gandalf turned to follow her gaze as the rumbling grew to almost painful volume.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Horrified, Gandalf breathed, “Were-worms.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Resolve tempering the fear, she turned to face Gandalf.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>Gandalf reassures Radagast after Saruman is mean to him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Prompt from hobbitkink ‘Comfort fic with Gandalf reassuring Radagast after Saruman is typically mean to him?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf is currently smoking his pipe whilst sitting in the home of Radagast, the brown and fellow Istari trying to offer wisdom and support for the problem that is currently plaguing the younger wizard seems to be having – if he can get a word in.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“He’s just always so mean Gandalf.” grumbles Radagast, trying to keep himself calm by cuddling a hedgehog.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I,” starts Gandalf, knowing exactly who the who is.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Ooh, did he now.” says Gandalf trying a different approach.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Better?” Gandalf asks bringing Radagast back from his comatose haze.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yes!” answers Radagast snapping back to reality, but with a much calmer appearance, before promptly bursting into tears, throwing himself at Gandalf for a hug.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“My dear friend, have you got anything to drink?” asks Gandalf gently causing Radagast to spring into action.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Have you got anything a little stronger?” asks Gandalf unsure of just how old the milk is.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Watching Radagast  from the other side of the room Gandalf smokes his pipe making ever larger rings and at one point a boat “Oh that’s clever.” says Radagast staring in wonder and amazement.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No, close but no,” says Gandalf mysteriously.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ignoring Radagast’s sigh Gandalf reaches into one of his many pockets before holding aloft the new wonder.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“What is it Gandalf, what is it?” asks Radagast practically bouncing with exciting.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf nods before speaking “When smoked, it has a most pleasant effect on the mind.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And so Gandalf the grey and Radagast the brown two of the great Istari sat and deepened their bonds of brotherwizardhood by getting stoned and bitching about Saruman until the sun came up, when they were both hit by the mother of all hangovers.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf left with his horse on some secret wizard thing and immediately the mighty dwarves of Erebor dropped their weapons…and their trousers.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>All is silent in the clearing, even Gandalf who stands poised to reveal the sun and kill the trolls cannot quite believe what he is seeing.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>From the top of the large rock above the clearing Gandalf shouts “Dawn take you all, and stone be to you!” dramatically striking the rock with his staff, splitting it in half, allowing the sunlight behind it to pour into the clearing.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>All the dwarves cheer for Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>If anyone asked Gandalf how the peace talks were going his answer would be somewhere between not very well and disastrously…but as it happens no-one was asking his opinion and the wizard was most put out.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Lord Dáin, stand down there are many things,” starts Gandalf, trying his best to calm the situation and not leave these idiots to the mercy of the oncoming army.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>For a moment Gandalf does wonder if Thranduil is dead – a blow such as that would easily have killed an orc, but a groan of pain reassures him all is still relatively well.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>A Half Elf/Half Dragon, has joined the Company and Thorin is furious that Gandalf recruited Her.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She’d been travelling with the company of Thorin Oakenshield for some months now, mainly on the say so of the meddling wizard Gandalf, as he thought she would not only be useful when confronting Smaug but that it would do her good to get out of that little cave…of course being half elf and half dragon made life a little difficult, the dragon was easy to hide…it's not like she had wings or anything, just the odd scale, very sharp claws and the ability to breath fire, to most people who met her, the young half dragon just looked like a small elf, not much taller than a dwarf, but with pointy ears and graceful movements.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“My dear you can do it, can't you?” questioned Gandalf innocently enough.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“She’s only half dragon Thorin.” says Gandalf placating manner.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Oh, well it's…elf.” mumbles Gandalf in answer, fumbling with his pipe.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The dwarves hired Bilbo to be their burglar, they hire Gandalf’s apprentice for another reason.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s apprentice was really quite happy to follow her tutor on this madcap venture that he had instigated.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Although that being said they weren’t actually going to share it with Gandalf…or his helper.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>(It had been decided that the witch and the hobbit should go alone as neither where dwarves and Gandalf had buggered off, as he was want to do.)<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She signs without reading the document, something Gandalf had warned could one day land a person in hot water.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It might also have had something to do with the fact that Gandalf the Grey, wizard extraordinaire wasn't with them, meaning Thorin could do as he pleased with no fear of being reprimanded by the old coot.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thankfully for the company of Thorin Oakenshield, they chanced upon Gandalf the Grey, a wizard extraordinaire, who had friends and acquaintances all over Middle Earth.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>“It’s not that cold Gandalf, really.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Hmph,” Gandalf snorted as he came up behind Radagast, rubbing his hands together.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Some tea would be nice,” Gandalf said to his back.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf smiled at him fondly, walking over to him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Oh yes,” Radagast replied, giving his coat to Gandalf, who hung up it next to his.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As Gandalf was drinking, Bilbo just stared at Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“What?” Gandalf asked tersely.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sighed and glanced at Radagast, who shrugged.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf shifted uncomfortably.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf waved his hand.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo narrowed his eyes as he sussed out what Gandalf was saying.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yes!” Gandalf smiled widely.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He crossed his arms and glared very hard at the wall over Gandalf’s shoulder.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“What?” Gandalf asked, bewildered.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Bilbo swallowed and followed behind Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He felt Gandalf touch his shoulder and glanced up.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And these are his cousins and business partners; Balin and Dwalin Fundinson and Dori Rison,” Gandalf said with a smirk, as the other three men came around and stood behind Thorin.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Let’s sit down,” Gandalf said as he sat in a chair nearest the desk.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He moved to sit across from Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Bilbo flushed and hastily sat next to Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Make the home seem homey, which Gandalf insists you’re good at.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
 “That’s fine,” Gandalf said smoothly cutting in before Bilbo could get even more worked up.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Beside him he felt Gandalf chuckling and trying to hide it behind a cough.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>Gandalf had offered to bring him back to the Shire on his horse, but Bilbo had insisted on going alone, and a hobbit can be terribly stubborn, and finally Gandalf gave in.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As it was rumored, it was Gandalf who came as a disturber of the peace.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was, however, expected, because Bilbo came running out to the gate and called out to the wizard, “Gandalf, finally!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf took it with good grace though, half-grinning in his long beard.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Once he got them all mugs of ale and a platter of cakes (because there Should Always Be Food), he turned to Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But I have often visited Gandalf, who was healing from battle wounds in Rivendell the last years, and I have also been conversing privately with Lord Elrond and Lady Galadriel.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>So I asked Lord Elrond and Gandalf for council when I was in Rivendell last month and showed the Ring to them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Over the course of a few chilly, firelit evenings, Bilbo and Gandalf had told her and Tauriel, Gilraen and Mir – and weren’t they a strange little company, on a strange, secretive quest – all about this business with the Ring.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf knew them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Master Gandalf,” she said, “please tell me about orcs.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf frowned at his pipe.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf suddenly, brightly, beamed at her.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf takes over with the tale of the battle he fought at Dol Goldur, which wounded him so grievously.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I was wondering, are you immortal?” Gandalf doesn’t take offense.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They can now descend its forested hills and follow the azure river all the way to the Emyn Muil, where according to Gandalf the terrain will become too rocky and steep to continue on its shores.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Tauriel, lean and tall, and Ysaude, wide-hipped and almost as tall, are diving and splashing about and generally having lots of fun; Gandalf, looking surprisingly skinny and frail without his big robes, is half-submerged and talking quietly to Gilraen, who is washing her long, black hair.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Later in the evening Gandalf tells about his century long relationship with Radagast, another wizard who apparently keeps a more domestic lifestyle in a forest on the other side of the Misty Mountains.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf frowns.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Now that is an interesting thought,” Gandalf speaks.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She knows Gandalf well and Gilraen is already a good friend; little Bilbo and young Ysaude are both very likeable.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Mir will lead Bilbo, Ysaude and Gandalf through the underground tunnels.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf quietly laughs in his beard.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s thundering look and Ysaude’s quiet giggles get soon lost in the growing darkness and stillness Mir usherers them in.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They are grateful for Gandalf’s staff, which spreads a soft, blue light even under water.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“These places may have currents which can draw you under.” Gandalf hands Ysaude his light, and then the girl takes a few deep breaths and dives.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Arwen shushes the other two, “Gandalf and I will figure something out.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf and Arwen immediately stick their heads together to speak about the crossing to Oroduin.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf says, “Only that which Bilbo carries will truly render one invisible.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It takes Ysaude and Gandalf and Mir to get him to calm down, but after a while he is at least not squeaking and flinging his arms around anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf manages to catch a bewildered bat and whispers to it; quickly it flies off.<|endoftext|>


<|endoftext|>“Uncle Gandalf?” he says, squinting at the visitor.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Hey, man,” Gandalf says, reclining on the steps and taking a drag on his joint.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yeah, well I kinda thought I should be here for this,” Gandalf says.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Well, you see, I know this guy,” Gandalf says.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It’s like this business thing,” Gandalf repeats.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf trails off.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Oh, no, man!” Gandalf says, suddenly snapping to.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Aw, come on, man,” Gandalf whines.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“A little harsh, man,” Gandalf says.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When he comes back outside a few minutes later, Gandalf is still on the steps.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“And stay away from my pantry.” Gandalf opens his mouth to protest.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’ll come back later, then!” Gandalf calls as Bilbo shuts the door, perhaps a little harder than he intended to.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf waves from the steps and takes another drag on his joint.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I got the pizza,” Gandalf says.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Well, I said I’d come back later,” Gandalf says with a shrug, causing the towering stack of pizzas to sway in a way that makes Bilbo nervous.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf casually steps over the pile of people still on the floor and safely deposits the pizza boxes onto the kitchen counter.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Who are these people?” he asks Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Eat up, man,” Gandalf says, handing him a plate.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sits and watches with an amused smile on his face, but Bilbo thinks it’s more likely from what he’d been smoking earlier than from the present company.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He makes to stand up, but Gandalf pushes his back into his seat.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“He’s here,” Gandalf says.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf opens the door to reveal the final guest.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Ah, Gandalf,” he says.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Sorry, man,” Gandalf says.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You haven’t told him – I didn’t say – you insufferable idiot!” But Gandalf just shrugs, a loopy smile on his face.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It’s all good,” Gandalf says.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thorin looks quite unable to talk at the moment, so Gandalf steps in.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We need someone to help us, someone we can trust, and Gandalf has suggested you.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf has fallen asleep across the sofa in the sitting room, and Bilbo hasn’t the heart to move him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Ah, Bilbo!” Gandalf says.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looks supremely uncomfortable at the large security presence - in fact, Bilbo notices that most of his companions are shifting about rather nervously.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I took a guess on the danish, and Gandalf’s told me how you take your coffee.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I mean, you and Gandalf seem to know each other well enough.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He, too, glances over at Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Once everyone has gathered their luggage from baggage claim, the group splits; it’s mostly brothers leaving in pairs, and at the end, it’s Thorin, Bilbo, Fíli, Kíli, and Gandalf left behind.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Are you coming with us?” Thorin asks Gandalf as they wait for their Uber.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Nah, man,” Gandalf says.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf waves goodbye as the other four climb into their Uber and it drives away.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Hey, man,” Gandalf answers after several rings.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf - ” Bilbo begins, only to find that the words are indeed reluctant to come out.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf, what exactly is it that Thorin does for work?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I like to call him a collector,” Gandalf says.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Con men, if you want to cut to the heart of it,” Gandalf says.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yeah, did I not mention that?” Gandalf asks.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yeah, okay, that one’s on me - that’s by bad,” Gandalf says.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Think of it like Thorin’s Robin Hood,” Gandalf says.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf, I have been in Chicago for less than twenty four hours and I have already been around more crime than I have in the past few decades of my life,” Bilbo says, pinching the bridge of his nose and closing his eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I wouldn’t exactly call the scope of the con that Thorin and Bofur are running out of this pub ‘little.’ If only you’d been here to see what I have witnessed so far tonight, you wouldn’t be arguing with me right now.” A beat goes by and Gandalf says nothing, which makes Bilbo’s heart sink.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He pulls it out, and sees that it’s from Gandalf:<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf and his boyfriend, Radagast, would occasionally make an appearance, though Bilbo suspected that their visits were less about being helpful to the company’s cause and more about the fact that they could drink for free at the bar.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And he loves his uncle Gandalf too, despite their differences.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo looks up, with shock to match the triplets’, to see his uncle Gandalf standing next to them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’m Gandalf,” Bilbo’s uncle says.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“And Gandalf means, well… me.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo barely dares to open his eyes, and when he does, he sees Gandalf in front of him, pistol held tightly between both of his hands.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looks dumbfounded at the three bodies before him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf, get us out of these things.” He gestures with is bound hands.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf obliges, pulling out a pocket knife and cutting the ties.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That was the worst acid trip of my life.” Gandalf shakily reaches into his pocket and produces a joint and a lighter.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He lights the joint and takes a nice, long drag on it before handing it back to Gandalf, who grumbles in annoyance.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf, you should start bringing Radagast with you if he’s still in town.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo watches it go, and then looks over to the pub in time to see Gandalf haul an enraged Bifur through the front door.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf has his arms hooked under Bifur’s armpits, and Bifur is waving his fists about wildly, two middle fingers flying proudly in the direction they’ve just come from.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Babe, no,” Gandalf whines, but Radagast merely shakes his head.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He looks at Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf chews nervously on his lower lip.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf considers this a moment, then nods.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“About a half hour walk,” Gandalf says.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf walks up to the voice box by the front door, somewhat nervously, Bilbo thinks.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Hey, Elrond, it’s me, Gandalf,” his uncle says.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Nah, they’re just friends,” Gandalf says.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf leads them up to the third floor, and knocks at the first door on their right.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You can’t just bring people here, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yeah, they’re all cool,” Gandalf says with a shrug.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Um, Gandalf…?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf bowls ahead before the rest of Bilbo’s question can escape his mouth.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Uh, I haven’t told them.” Gandalf’s voice is shy; Bilbo’s never heard this tone from his uncle before.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Elrond sighs and looks at Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf folds his arms across his chest defensively.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“He only sells his stuff to bad people,” Gandalf counters.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“What bad people?” This comes from Thorin, who is looking at Gandalf with narrowed eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Well, um - ” Gandalf stammers.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No, no, no, it’s all cool,” Gandalf says, as reassuringly as he can manage while simultaneously taking several steps back from Thorin in a defensive retreat.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Look, I ran some numbers for him for a bit last year, okay?” Gandalf huffs.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo and Gandalf follow them, and Elrond offers his services; just because he’s had his medical license revoked doesn’t mean that he didn’t still spend eight years in med school.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Elrond nods before ducking over to speak quietly with Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo can’t help but notice that a sizeable wad of cash stays in Elrond’s hand, no doubt an offer of payment for his hospitality, plus most likely whatever Gandalf owes him for things that Bilbo does not even want to begin to think about.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Unfortunately, Gandalf’s mood has gone in quite the opposite direction.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thorin says that it’s too risky to go by Radagast’s apartment, but he did finally concede to allowing Gandalf to turn his phone on briefly twice a day to check for any messages or missed calls, but none have come.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>In what Bilbo suspects may have been a genuine attempt to comfort him, Dwalin suggests to Gandalf that, had the Wargs indeed managed to overpower Radagast, there would have been some very public display of retaliation, and most likely a body would have turned up by now.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Once he’s satisfied with a quick count of everyone who’s run past him (twelve, plus Bilbo and Thorin; Dís and Gandalf had respectfully backed out of the evening’s plans), he grabs Bilbo’s hand and pulls him outside the bar.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Of all the people Bilbo might have expected to see tonight, his uncle Gandalf had not been one of them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The only one presently unaccounted for is Gandalf, and it’s not long before they come across him while rounding a corner, locked in a scuffle with one of the guards.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf bends to pick up the dropped weapon.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo whips around to see - once again, Jesus Christ - Gandalf holding the gun out in front of him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Quickly they disappear from sight, and Bilbo is left alone in the dark street, winded, bruised, afraid, and still clutching onto the hand gun he’d taken from Gandalf like his life depends on.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He can feel the skin on his knuckles break and split open as he lands; the hand gun he’d grabbed from Gandalf back in the warehouse digs painfully into his side from where he’s stashed it in his jacket pocket.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s face is twisted in annoyance, his arms crossed defensively over his chest.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sniffs.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Look,” Gandalf says after several seconds of charged silence.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Beorn’s the best bet we have right now,” Gandalf assures them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He looks at Gandalf for a long moment before saying, “Okay - we’ll go.” He opens the car door and steps out; the other three follow suit.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf scowls at him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf gives directions to the drivers, and they load back into the cars for one more trip.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Two rainbow flags frame the front door, and there’s a sign that stands next to the front porch steps that reads: “Queer Lodgings.” Bilbo has to stifle a chuckle; of course Gandalf would think to bring them here.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Speaking of which, it’s Gandalf who’s leading the way up the front porch steps and into the house, Thorin right behind him; Bilbo jogs to catch up.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf,” he says coolly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Well, been busy,” Gandalf says with what Bilbo thinks is an almost nervous laugh.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“We need somewhere to lay low for a day or two, and I thought that you’d be the perfect person to help us,” Gandalf says.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looks over to Thorin, wordlessly signaling for help.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Shouldn’t be a problem,” Gandalf says quickly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Actually, we’ve had a bit of a long night,” Gandalf says.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He looks at Gandalf, who’s sitting to Fíli’s left.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“So, what is it this time, Gandalf?” he asks casually.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf crosses his arms over his chest defensively.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had been right, in a sense, when he’d described Beorn’s business as a B&B.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Thorin!” Bilbo and Gandalf yelp at the same time.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thorin rounds on Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Bilbo, be a good lad and help me get your things out of my car before Gandalf and I leave.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I need to get Gandalf out of here - I mean, well out here for a little bit,” Radagast says.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Christ - that was you too?” Radagast says, and Gandalf nods.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I knew Murray was dead, but… Jesus, Gandalf.” He sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>After Radagast and Gandalf departed (they were headed for Beorn’s family farm, about an hour outside of the city, which was less of a farm and more of a small house attached to a lot of land these days), the company regrouped to discuss the plan.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf would have loved it, Bilbo thinks idly as he takes in the sight.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf told me you guys were just small time criminals.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He tries to think of Thorin, of Fíli and Kíli, of the company - even of his uncle Gandalf and Radagast.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I traded in any hopes of a promotion for Gandalf five years ago when I realized that he and the Dirty Baker’s Dozen were only ever going to be an observation report and never a completed objective.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf’s killed four fucking people in all this,” he says.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Radagast has barely cut the engine when the front door of the house bangs open and the entire company comes spilling out, followed closely by Bain and Tilda, and - to Bilbo’s surprise - Gandalf and Dís.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Dís has her arms wrapped around Fíli and Kíli; Bard has his kids in a group hug; Nori and Mera are still wrapped up in a tight embrace; Tauriel is being congratulated and welcomed back by the remaining members of the company; Gandalf and Radagast are smiling fondly at each other.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>“Gandalf!” he hissed, “What are you doing here?” The man-Gandalf Greyhame, Bilbo’s publisher and friend-chuckled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf grinned.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Well, I had to check that you actually turned up for your holiday,” Gandalf told him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You’re not and everyone can see it-except, apparently, you!” Gandalf scolded him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I…what…we’re moving?” Radagast handed a Bellini to Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That is rather the point of a cruise,” Gandalf pointed out.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Bilbo!” Gandalf told him sharply.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“If not when!” Gandalf corrected him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Drink this,” Gandalf said more practically and handed Bilbo his Bellini.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stared after him fondly,<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>He found it hard to say  Gandalf  even to himself, so different was this being from the old man that he knew, gray and weary with long journeys and the weight of his terrible wisdom.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>A recognition that was neither Frodo’s, nor Gandalf’s, but its own, came welling out of that portion of Frodo’s mind that never left the Ring.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>From somewhere high above, he heard a voice that Gandalf knew and trusted, that the Ring knew and hated.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was a soldier–no, a healer–in a war of some sort.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf!” The dream had separated them at last; Frodo was himself once more, sitting on the grass of Lórien with his old friend beside him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Ah,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sighed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Half of what the wizard was saying made no sense to Frodo, but the thought that Gandalf also longed for a home to which he could never return struck him with sudden pity and an intense fellow-feeling.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“A dream, Frodo,” said Gandalf, staring off into the midnight shadows where the starlight filtered through the treetops.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf gave him a keen and evaluative glance.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf smiled, the lines of his face deepening.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Oh, I am very much from this world,” said Gandalf, laughing as if at some private, rueful joke.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Well,” said Gandalf, “everything, really.” He looked about for a pipe, but the dream had failed to provide one.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I–I do know what I’ve chosen, Gandalf.” Here in the dream he could say what he could never bear to in the waking world.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf did not deny it, but looked at him thoughtfully.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Something within him–a much younger self, the hobbit-lad who had thrown his arms around Gandalf’s knees when the old wizard visited his uncle–was crying out in protest.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But it was Gandalf beside him, reaching out to give comfort and to receive it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Frodo thought again of how Gandalf had looked at the Balrog, of that dreadful splintered recognition.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Even the shield of that other dreaming self–and this was still Gandalf’s dream, he recognized and partook in this music, he was making it, made by it, native to it–could hardly keep Frodo from being torn apart and swept away in glory and in terror.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>In all of the other visions, Frodo had been able to find some mask, some metaphor, that would enable him to understand at least a part of what Gandalf was remembering.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As if that brought him closer to whatever kind of creature Gandalf was, at this unutterable beginning of his existence, he began to understand his surroundings.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was overwhelmed and frightened because Gandalf was overwhelmed and frightened.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And yet it was the same being, just as Gandalf was the same being.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But the Ring was blazing on his hand and in his soul, and Frodo knew with the intense and immediate certainty of dreams that if he saw who it was that Gandalf was defying, he would burn like a handful of dry leaves.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>I thought old Gandalf would set him on fire!"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He made it sound far less frightening than it actually was, focusing mostly on Legolas and his teasing of Gandalf, which had Rosie laughing so hard she nearly spilled her tea.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He found Gandalf sitting near the middle of the ship, underneath the mast, his pipe glowing gently in the darkness.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf chuckled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf blew a smoke ring up into the air, and they watched it float up towards the sails before scattering in the breeze.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sighed, and blew another smoke ring up onto the breeze.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"It was not a hobbit that killed him," Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The journey was not quite as monotonous as Gandalf had predicted.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>October 6th came with dark dreams and a great deal of pain in his shoulder and in his chest, but Elrond and Gandalf remained by his side the whole day long—out on deck, in the bright sunlight—and though it was difficult and painful, it was easier to get through the day than Frodo had expected.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When he was not learning surprising and sometimes alarming things about what lived in the water beneath them, Frodo was sitting with Bilbo, when he wasn't napping, or with Gandalf, who wanted to hear about all of what had been going on in the Shire, down to the smallest doings of the smallest hobbit child.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He had settled on the deck in front of the bench where Frodo was seated between Elrond and Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"There was that nice song you wrote for me after Moria," Gandalf said mildly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Especially Gandalf, who seemed to find it extremely amusing to get to listen to a lament for himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf laughed out loud, an outpouring of joy as sudden and bright as one of his fireworks.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf pointed out Alqualondë in the distance across the water, glimmering like a pearl nestled between beaches of rainbow sand.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He looked away again, back toward Gandalf, who was laughing again, leaning on his staff although Frodo was certain he didn't need it any longer.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"You are going with Elrond and his household, for the moment," Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As Gandalf led Shadowfax down the gangplank, Lindir came up from the cabins with Frodo's pack and Bilbo's in his hands.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The days turned into weeks, and there was still neither sign nor word from Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>In fact, Gandalf returned only a few days later.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Hullo, Gandalf!"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf raised his bushy eyebrows.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"So I can," said Gandalf as he took a seat beside Bilbo, "and so I have.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf's eyebrows rose again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf rose and went to pull a scroll off of a shelf full of them tucked into little nooks.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Well, all of the folk who lived there have ended up in Valinor, either by sailing or through the Halls of Mandos," said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"No, not yet," said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They said farewell to Elrond and Celebrían and Galadriel at the harbor, and Gandalf led the way to a stable where Shadowfax waited for them, munching contentedly on oats.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"On the road again with Gandalf!"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was a song Frodo knew, so he joined in on the chorus, and Gandalf, after he was done laughing, also sang along.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo asked Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf replied, chuckling.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The elves were delighted to have a new audience for their songs, and to tease Gandalf for his beard and bushy eyebrows.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>At least Gandalf and Bilbo had known him before all of that.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"There is Lórien," said Gandalf, gesturing with his pipe.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Of course they have," said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>he asked Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Now you rest," said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf seemed to have settled in for a good long smoke, so Frodo went out alone to walk a little bit, examining the flowers and berry bushes that he did not know.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn and Gandalf and the others had drawn him off and all of his thought was focused on the Black Gate, until I put the thing on.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Sauron would have still been, though," said Frodo, "and it was your Rings that kept Lórien and Rivendell safe and fair, and helped Gandalf to achieve his tasks—though all we knew in the Shire was that he made really remarkable fireworks."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf agreed that it should be so, and Galadriel and Elrond also—and so too did Manwë give his willing consent."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo and Gandalf were in the kitchen; smoke curled around Gandalf's head as he blew smoke rings, before it drifted lazily to the hearth and up the chimney.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What was his name, Gandalf?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf blew another smoke ring and peered closely at Frodo; whatever he saw seemed to satisfy him, as he did not say anything, only settled back in his seat and turned to Bilbo.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Bilbo shall be writing another book before long," Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
   “He says he knows Gandalf-“<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
   “How do we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf’s?” In response, Frodo fixed his eyes on the back of Strider’s head and said,<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
   “Gandalf...” again he cried, “Gandalf!”<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>"Gandalf!"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"I do apologize for not writing first," Gandalf said, straightening up.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf quickly moved to the center of the house where the ceiling was highest.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf laughed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was then he noticed Frodo sitting in his playpen and staring up at Gandalf with huge eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Frodo, this is my dear friend, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Can you say, 'hullo, Gandalf'?"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He looked at Gandalf and shrugged.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"That's quite all right," Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He ran his hand over Frodo's bedhead and Frodo promptly reached for his beard and pulled on it hard enough to make Gandalf wince.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf asked, regarding the lad thoughtfully.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf narrowed his eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>In fact, he didn't look a day older than the last time Gandalf had seen him, over a decade ago.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Indeed I am," Bilbo said proudly, and Gandalf could see in his eyes that he wasn't lying.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The two of them enjoyed tea as Gandalf told him all that he had been doing since their last meeting.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Rather than risk him toppling it over and possibly hurting himself, Gandalf quickly stood up and lifted him out and into his arms.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf asked gently.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"I don't know," Gandalf admitted.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf kept two eyes on Frodo, and did so most curiously.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was so lost in thought he almost missed Bilbo shout, "He's headed for the china!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf snapped to attention and hurried over to pick up the little lad just as he was reaching a hand up to grab one of Bilbo's good china plates from the cabinet, which would have surely broken had he touched it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The china was spared, but the very minute Gandalf had Frodo in his arms, he began crying again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Once again Bilbo rushed to take him from Gandalf, and once again Frodo became calm as soon as he was in Bilbo's arms.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"I don't believe he likes me very much," Gandalf said, trying not to sound as hurt as he felt.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Would you like something, Gandalf?"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Oh I'm fine, thank you," Gandalf said, and reclaimed his place at the table.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Before Gandalf could answer, Bilbo had already deposited Frodo onto his lap.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf tensed, waiting for the inevitable torrent of tears, but to his surprise it didn't come.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf smiled and put an arm around his waist so he wouldn't fall.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Frodo took his beard in his fingers and began playing with it, causing Gandalf to chuckle at the ticklish sensation.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"You go ahead and eat, Bilbo, I'll do it," Gandalf offered, wanting to feel useful.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf regarded Frodo with a thoughtful look on his face.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf laughed merrily as he moved to the high chair and buckled Frodo into it, patting the little one on the head.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf shook his head.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Exactly," Gandalf nodded, eyes twinkling.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>If Primula and Drogo thought Bilbo was good with children, they should have seen Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He jumped up and ran all about trying to catch the bursts of light, and soon wore himself out so much that he fell asleep right in his playpen, an opportunity which Bilbo and Gandalf took full advantage of as they sat down and relished the quiet.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>For a while this seemed to work; Frodo would build something with the blocks, knock it over, and then start again as Bilbo and Gandalf talked of all matter of things.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But then Gandalf asked, "My friend, may I trouble you for a pipe?"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Hold my pipe for a second," he said, handing it to Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Not till you're older," Bilbo said as he sat down again and took his pipe back from Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Frodo stood in front of the wizard's legs and tried to reach for Gandalf's pipe while he was distracted, but he caught the lad just in time.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"I am sorry Frodo, but your uncle clearly said no," Gandalf said, shrugging.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He turned to Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf raised his eyebrows, wondering what his friend would do.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Frodo reached his hand through the bars and howled, but Bilbo ignored him as he rejoined Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf followed him and sat down with him in the front yard, but asked, "Are you sure it's wise to leave him alone?"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I told him no clear as day and here I've got company and he just insists on- he broke out of his thoughts when he noticed Gandalf laughing next to him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"My dear Bilbo, if you could only see the look on your face," Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf laughed again but gently massaged the bump.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"It appears hobbits of all ages desire pipeweed," Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf gave him a reassuring smile.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He smiled and roused himself out of bed to see Frodo jumping up and down, laughing and trying to grab Gandalf's staff, which was changing color and had small lights spouting out of the top.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"The last I heard from Balin, he was leading an expedition into Moria," Gandalf said, and Bilbo did not like the look on his face or the sound of his tone when he said it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf shook his head.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked at him intently.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf raised an eyebrow.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf crossed his arms.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo and Gandalf had been so absorbed in their conversation that they hadn't noticed what Frodo was doing.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The word came out like a growl, and Bilbo accompanied it by shoving Frodo in the chest hard enough to knock him over, sending him backwards so his head hit the floor with a thud so loud it made Gandalf wince.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There were many things Gandalf could think of to say to that, namely having to do with why Bilbo was completely ignoring Frodo's cries of pain, but he settled for saying, "Bilbo Baggins, don't you think that was a bit unreasonable?"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>His face was so contorted that Gandalf hardly recognized it, and he forced himself to keep a calm tone.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo stormed off and Gandalf set his staff aside so he could hold Frodo with both hands.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Shh, there there, it's all right," Gandalf murmured, holding him against his shoulder.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Frodo sobbed into his cloak and Gandalf ran his fingers through his curls to make sure there was no bump or bruise.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf asked incredulously.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When Bilbo didn't answer, Gandalf gave him a hard glare.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Easy for Gandalf to say, he thought.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had never been in the role of a full-time parent.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf shifted to allow Bilbo access, but Frodo clung to him tightly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The look in his eyes was so heartbreaking that Gandalf almost felt like crying himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He buried his face in Gandalf's shoulder and wouldn't look at Bilbo.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He tried to lift Frodo up, but his fingers were locked around Gandalf's cloak.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"He's afraid of you, Bilbo," Gandalf said softly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He leaned in closer and Frodo pushed his face farther into Gandalf's shoulder.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Frodo hesitated, but when Bilbo began to sniffle, Frodo crawled across Gandalf's lap and into Bilbo's arms.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The hobbits hugged each other hard and Gandalf smiled, feeling relief wash over him like a wave.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The next few days were some of the fondest in Gandalf's memory; by now Frodo had wormed his way into his heart as easily as Bilbo had.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo was grateful for the adult conversation and an extra pair of hands for when Frodo got fussy or made messes, and the three of them lived peacefully together until the morning came when Gandalf looked out the window and saw the white wizard passing through the fields.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"My head of my order has arrived in the Shire," Gandalf said when they sat down to breakfast.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Yes, I feel I've already overstayed my welcome," Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo protested, but nonetheless he agreed to walk down to the pasture with Gandalf to meet Saruman and that they would part ways from there.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"To meet a wizard even greater than Gandalf is a high honor indeed," Bilbo said, giving a little bow.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"I suppose that's not surprising," Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Saruman was staring at the oxen and Frodo with a grin that Gandalf found a bit disconcerting.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf tried to take him from Saruman, but the wizard held him high.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He grinned at Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had never seen his eyes so full of rage.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Saruman, please," Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"I beg you tell me why you felt the need to do such a thing," Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"But he's only a baby," Gandalf said, puzzled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Saruman shrugged his question off and Gandalf felt a little shiver despite the warm day.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When Saruman raised his eyebrows, Gandalf said, "He is a dear friend of mine, after all."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf hurried back up the hill to Bilbo's house and quickly rapped the door with his staff.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"I sincerely apologize for my advisor's behavior," Gandalf said, shaking his head sadly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When Gandalf didn't move to come inside, Bilbo asked, "Are you leaving us now?"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Yes, I'm afraid I must," Gandalf said, giving Frodo a pat on the head and kneeling with his arms open.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo set Frodo down and entered Gandalf's embrace.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Of course, my friend," Gandalf said, and stood up.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Can you say goodbye to Gandalf?"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He waved a tiny hand and Gandalf waved back as he straightened his hat and turned to leave.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Saruman was waiting for him rather impatiently at the bottom of the hill, and as they walked Gandalf noticed the white wizard was taking no pains to avoid trampling the flowerbeds the hobbit gardeners had planted.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>At one point a child who Gandalf recognized from one of the parties came running and begging for fireworks, and Saruman glared at her and held out his staff menacingly until she ran away.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf said nothing, but found himself wishing he were still inside a hobbit-hole in Bag End instead of wondering whether Saruman was still the kind and gentle wizard he so fondly remembered.<|endoftext|>


<|endoftext|>"This is Gandalf!"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Gandalf!"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Frodo stepped forward, reaching out to brush a hand against the worn sleeve of Gandalf's robe.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf quirked his bushy eyebrows.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He gestured in the vague direction of Frodo's room with the toasting fork and Gandalf ducked just in time.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Whoops, sorry, Gandalf, didn't mean to nearly whack you there."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He sat down on the bench next to Bilbo, who was talking animatedly to Gandalf, and devoured the toast.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Well, I bring word from Dale for you, Bilbo," Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Here you are, Mr Gandalf, sir," Frodo said, handing him the bag.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf thanked him, and rustled through it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Well, Frodo my lad, it's yours to give to the new lad or lass down at Gamgee's," Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Both Gandalf and Bilbo hastened to cover their ears.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf followed, more slowly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"A good strong name for a good strong lad," Gandalf said, coming out onto the steps.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo ducked back into the house for a moment, then he and Gandalf followed more sedately.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bell Gamgee, up and about already, bid fair to be intimidated by Bilbo, not to mention Gandalf, but Bilbo laughed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"There's a pair of lifelong friends," Gandalf remarked.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>He had never met the wizard, but Gandalf had always spoken very highly of his dear friend and knowing how much Faramir loved lore and reading, had urged him to one day visit the wise wizard.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Lord Elrond, this is Fa—” Glorfindel had been in the middle of introducing Faramir to Elrond when Gandalf had turned around.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You know this man, Gandalf?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir has been a dear friend of mine since the time he was a mere child of three, running around on unsteady legs chasing his older brother.” Faramir laughed slightly at Gandalf’s words.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Though, I fear if you show him your library, he may never leave it.” Gandalf’s eyes sparkled with humour and even Elrond let out a small laugh, before addressing Faramir once more.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Denethor sent you?” Gandalf seemed ill at ease know that it was his father who sent him here.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Both Elrond and Gandalf looked interested, and it was clear that they knew of parts of the dream and what they meant, and the scholar in Faramir wanted to ask them right now for answers.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I must leave you now, but as you are acquainted with Gandalf already, I will allow him to escort you to your rooms.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He and Gandalf caught up on what had happened since the last time they saw each other, which was several years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had spent a long time in the library of Minas Tirith, reading through old letters and transcripts dating back to the late second age and early third age.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir had helped all he could, but Gandalf was more private than usual and Faramir had his own duties in Ithilien to attend to.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He and Boromir used to race each other to see who could reach Gandalf first when they saw him riding towards Minas Tirith.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir, however, became more eager to spend more time with Gandalf the older he got, desperate for anything he could learn from him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf chuckled at the memory of two young boys sprinting towards him and throwing their arms around him whenever he approached the White City.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf opened a door to the library of Rivendell and once more Faramir found himself speechless.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had been talking to him, but he found himself unable to listen.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Seeing his enthusiasm, Gandalf patted him on the back with a smile on his face.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir smiled at Gandalf’s words, for they meant a lot to him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He had doubted himself for as long as he could remember and to have someone as wise as Gandalf place faith in him was a confidence boost, assured him that he was right to take his brothers place.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Murmurs from around the council began to cease as Lord Elrond walked in with Gandalf, who took a seat to the Hobbit’s right, with Lord Elrond on the other side of the wizard.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>To his surprise, even Gandalf stood up and began to argue, trying to break up the argument between the elves and the dwarves, but was soon dragged into the argument himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf walked up to Frodo and placed a hand on his shoulder for comfort.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Frodo smiled at Gandalf, and then Estel moved forward and knelt before Frodo.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Faramir,” Gandalf called, and he turned to see him stood with Elrond and Estel.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf must have seen the worry on his face, for he let out a small laugh and smiled at him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“We can only hope that, Faramir,” Gandalf said, a smile on his face.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was heading towards the stables to get Anorroch when Gandalf approached him, telling him that it may be best if his trusted horse was left behind, in case the road became dangerous.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir did not want to leave his companion behind but decided to do so on Gandalf’s advice.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf assured him that Lord Elrond would take care of Anorroch while he was away, and if anything happened to him while on the quest, Elrond would personally deliver Anorroch to the Steward.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He did not think his father had received word from Rivendell, for both Gandalf and Elrond seemed surprised to see him when he arrived.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Frodo nervously walked forward, joining Gandalf at the front, with the rest of the company following.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Of course, Gandalf he knew well, though as their guide, he had not managed to speak to his old mentor very often during their travel so far.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>At night, they would all sit around a fire, and Gandalf would talk about histories of the different lands they were traversing, and it took Faramir back to when he was a child, desperate for Gandalf to tell him anything about the places he had been to.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf has travelled across nearly all of Middle-Earth and knows these lands well.” He chuckled slightly and pointed out the River Bruinen in the distance.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir sat on a rock, watching as the hobbits played a game from the Shire, but he caught part of a conversation that Gandalf was having with Aragorn.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Is Théoden King well, Gandalf?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked disturbed by the news Faramir relayed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf thanked him for the information and returned to planning which route to take with Aragorn.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf, we could pass through the Mines of Moria.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But something passed over Gandalf’s face, making him look disturbed at Gimli’s idea.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gimli looked as if he was going to argue but closed his mouth when he remembered that Gandalf was the wisest of them all and knew the lands of Middle-Earth better than the rest of them combined.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He ran past Gandalf and looked out over the area, staring at a grey cloud in the distance.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As Aragorn and Gandalf shouted to hide, the Fellowship descended into a frenzy.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had no doubt that Saruman was no aware of where they were and would likely send orcs their way.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The passage south is being watched,” Gandalf told them, and they were all distressed at the news, knowing their plans had been thwarted.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf led the group on once more, heading further up the mountain.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I believe you are both alike and would benefit from one another’s counsel.” He then walked on to talk to Gandalf and helped him to clear the snow.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was in front, trying to carve out a path as he moved along, allowing easier passage for those behind him, but the vast amount of snow was making it hard for any of them to move.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The snow reached Faramir’s hip, and completely covered Gimli who could not see above the path that Gandalf had created.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>However, Gandalf became clued as to what the voice was.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf, we must turn back!” Aragorn shouted, receiving the backing of Faramir and Gimli.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>If Saruman knew where they were, he was powerful enough to thwart them, but Gandalf shook his head.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>However, as powerful as Gandalf was, Saruman was more so, and a great streak of lightning hit the top of the mountain, sending an avalanche of snow raining down upon them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Let us go through the Mines of Moria,” Gimli suggested as he had done earlier, but Gandalf looked stricken at his proposal once more, and it was clear that Gandalf believed the Mines held some peril.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Let the Ringbearer decide,” Gandalf said, and they all turned to look at Frodo, who, like Merry and Pippin, was turning blue and could not stop shivering.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Frodo?” Gandalf asked, and Frodo hesitated, unsure of which path to take.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“We will go through the Mines,” he said, and all but Gandalf let out a sigh of relief.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“What do you think it is that Gandalf fears in the Mines?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They walked over to the cliffs, and Gandalf hovered around, looking for something and he ran his hand along the walls.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Dwarf doors are invisible when closed,” Gimli explained to Faramir, and he was overheard by Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Eventually, Gandalf found a particular part of the wall and stopped, running his hand over it and muttering.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“What do you suppose that means?” Merry asked Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>If you are a friend, you speak the password and the doors will open.” Faramir watched as Gandalf turned back towards the door, held his staff towards the centre of it and started to utter the password in Elvish.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Confused, Gandalf tried again, still speaking in Elvish though he changed his words.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Quickly giving up, and muttering to himself, Gandalf now attempted to push open the door, but to no avail.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“What are you going to do then?” Pippin asked, and Gandalf, frustrated with his efforts, lost his temper somewhat.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Everyone sat around in silence, waiting for Gandalf to come up with the right words.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir tried to think of something to help his old mentor but could not think of anything Gandalf had already tried.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>By this point, Gandalf had completely succumbed to defeat, and was slumped on the floor.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What’s the Elvish word for friend?” he asked, and Gandalf moved from the floor to stand beside him, uttering the word ‘mellon’ as he stood before the door.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Into the mines!” Gandalf shouted, and they all turned back to run.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s staff was the only source of light the nine members of the Fellowship had as they traversed through the Mines of Moria.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It is a four-day journey to the other side, let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed.” Faramir certainly hoped that Gandalf’s estimation was wrong, and it would take less than four days.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And he hoped that these fouler things Gandalf spoke of were not encountered.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stopped and turned to see that everyone’s attention had been caught by the silver they saw and explained what it was to those who did not know.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yes, I never told him, but its worth was greater than the value of the Shire.” Frodo looked up to Gandalf in shock at his words, as was Faramir.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>After passing through the mithril mines, they reached a junction with several doorways and waited for Gandalf to lead them on, but he looked around, rather confused, with his memory failing him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Odd, as he had been leading them through the mines with no issue up until this point, but Faramir could see it written all over Gandalf’s face, the older man truly had no memory of ever being here.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Not even Gimli knew his way down here and so they waited for Gandalf to remember.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It is a long story,” he replied and Faramir laughed, pointing towards Gandalf, who still seemed no closer to figuring out which way was the correct way.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As they finished their conversation, they saw Gandalf jump up quickly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf held up his staff to illuminate the room, and after seeing it with light, Faramir knew it was much more than just an incredibly large room.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf tried to stop him, but he was too far ahead, and so they all followed him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf walked over to the tomb and read to the group what was written upon it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But Gandalf pried a large book from the hands of a skeleton next to the tomb.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As Gandalf finished speaking, a loud noise was heard from the room.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Everyone held their breath, expecting enemies to be alerted to their presence, but nothing happened other than Gandalf slamming the book shut and turning angrily towards Pippin.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Pippin looked sheepish, and though Gandalf did not truly mean his words, it clearly hurt the hobbit, though Faramir had no time to dwell on it as a drumming noise was heard, and with every beat, it was getting louder and faster.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Legolas and Aragorn drew their bows beside him, whilst behind them, Gandalf held Glamdring, shielding the four hobbits, whom were ready to fight themselves if they had to do so.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That spear would have skewered a wild boar,” Aragorn said, and Gandalf smiled slightly, eyes dancing with laughter.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“To the Bridge of Khazad-dûm,” Gandalf said, knowing they would not survive another attack in the small room they were in.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“What is that?” he asked Gandalf, who had frozen himself, eyes closed whilst he was deep in thought, or perhaps he was worried.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The bridge is near,” Gandalf said, as he urged Aragorn to the front.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf pointed to a narrow bridge in the distance, connecting two sides of a great chasm, a sheer drop into lava beneath it, and that was their destination.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Do as I say,” he continued, when Aragorn stumbled, confused as to what Gandalf was going to do, “swords are of no more use here.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He urged Gandalf to jump next, and the wizard jumped further than Faramir would’ve imagined possible for the older man, and he joined Legolas on the other side.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Over the bridge,” Gandalf shouted, urging them on, and they ran single-file over the bridge, the wizard waiting until they were all over and waiting at the back.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Instead of following them, Gandalf had stopped halfway across the bridge, facing the growing fire and from the midst of the flames, a great, black, winged creature appeared, roaring at Gandalf and breathing fire from its mouth.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The entire body of the creature was covered in flames and was the tallest living thing that Faramir had ever seen, but it seemed that Gandalf was not intimidated by the creature.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You cannot pass!” Gandalf shouted, still stood before the Balrog with his staff raised in the air.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The members of the Fellowship shouted at Gandalf, urging him to flee with them rather than take on the creature.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But the Balrog stretched its wings and drew up to its full height in front of Gandalf, whose staff started to glow as he chanted.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Wielder of the Flame of Arnor!” The Balrog drew what Faramir assumed was a sword and held it high above his head, bringing it down to Gandalf as he spoke the next words, “the dark fire will not avail you!” As the Balrog’s sword came upon Gandalf, he protected himself with his staff, a great flash lighting the chasm as the sword rebounded off the shield Gandalf had created.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>His mind went into overdrive worrying about Gandalf, for they needed to get out of there as quickly as possible.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You shall not pass!” Gandalf shouted, louder than before, and raised both sword and staff above his head.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>All members of the Fellowship breathed a sigh of relief, and Gandalf turned around to walk away, his work done.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As they began to exit the mines, they heard the whip, and turned back around to see that the whip had caught Gandalf’s ankle and dragged him down.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He too longed to run towards Gandalf and helped him, but he knew to aid Gandalf would put him in danger, and his top priority was keeping Frodo, and the rest of the hobbits, safe.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked up at them all, something close to fear in his eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Despite this, the pain he felt knowing Gandalf was gone nearly overwhelmed him, and he felt the beginning of tears in his eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>For as long as he could remember, every time his father had sneered at his scholarly interests, Gandalf was there to encourage him, taking on the role of mentor after seeing something in the Steward’s younger son.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Does he not realise that without Gandalf the quest is all but lost?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He felt shame for his earlier internal outburst at the man, and now realised why he was so highly regarded, and though they may no longer have Gandalf, the quest would continue, and their faith could be placed in Aragorn, who had demonstrated extraordinary leadership skills over the last few weeks.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>With no time to grieve for Gandalf now, he helped Merry and Pippin to their feet as Aragorn went over to Frodo, who had wondered off slightly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It occurred to Faramir that after the trauma of losing Gandalf, all of them had completely forgotten about the injury that Frodo had sustained due to the cave troll.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>With night approaching so quickly after arriving at the elven realm, Faramir knew that had they stopped outside Moria to mourn Gandalf for longer than we did, the orcs would’ve been right on their heels.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He cast his mind back to earlier in the day, when he had thought all things were lost after Gandalf’s fall.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Despite his new-found optimism, the main thing on his mind was how much it hurt to lose Gandalf, and now they were safe in Lothlórien, he had time to truly reflect on his death.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He had known Gandalf from the age of three, when his mother introduced him to the wizard who was visiting Minas Tirith to use the Citadel’s library.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And from that moment on, Gandalf had been a huge part of his life.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf meant a lot to you,” Legolas said, sneaking up on Faramir, and sitting beside him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Tell me where is Gandalf?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf the Grey did not pass the borders of this land.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Without Gandalf, hope is lost.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“A lament for Gandalf,” Legolas told the hobbits, who did not understand the elvish language, and they looked to the elves hidden in the trees in admiration.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir listened to their words, almost laughing at the accuracy, describing Gandalf exactly as he had known him during the times, he would visit Minas Tirith.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Though he would admit, if he had known what would happen to Gandalf, he would have never left his side, eager to soak up every last moment with a man who in many ways was like a father to him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Though Aragorn and Legolas were well travelled, they were not able to traverse Middle-Earth as Gandalf was.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir was suspicious of Gollum, having learned from Gandalf the story of his attachment to the Ring.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The four of them gasped in shock for before them dressed in all white and a white staff in hand, was Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As he had walked over the bridge, he saw that the chasm below them seemed endless and falling would mean certain death, but somehow Gandalf stood before them, very much alive.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir was too shocked to say anything, but he did bow his head towards Gandalf as a mark of respect.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You fell,” he said, and Gandalf’s face contorted, reliving the memories of what followed his fall.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He had never, and doubted he would ever, meet someone as extraordinary as Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf…” Gimli started, but did not continue speaking as the wizard looked puzzled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf?” he said, as if he had never heard of the name before, but then he smiled in recognition.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf the Grey.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I am Gandalf the White, and I come back to you now…at the turn of the tide.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Why, Faramir was unsure, but he assumed Gandalf did not want anyone to realise that he had been brought back as a white wizard.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was well known that Saruman was the most powerful of the wizards, and now Gandalf was also a white wizard, could he match his old master in terms of power.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They are with Treebeard and the ents,” Gandalf said, “they are safe.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn,” Gandalf answered, “a great power has been sleeping here for many years.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Beside Faramir, Aragorn chuckled at Gandalf’s words.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You still speak in riddles.” Gandalf returned the laugh, the first smile Faramir had seen on his face since they reunited.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The ents are going to wake up and find that they are strong.” As Gandalf finished, Gimli opened his mouth to protest once more, but Gandalf dismissed him, “stop your fretting, master dwarf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“There is trouble in Rohan,” Gandalf spoke, as if he was reading Faramir’s mind, “and it will not be easily cured.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They continued walking, everyone speaking to Gandalf, trying to get whatever information they could from him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You need not worry for Frodo, my lad,” Gandalf said, appearing suddenly next to Faramir and making him jump.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“During your time in Lóthlorien, Frodo was summoned by the Lady Galadriel, to have a glimpse of what the future may hold,” Gandalf began to explain, and Faramir realised this must have been where Frodo had disappeared to that night.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As Gandalf finished speaking, they reached the plains of Rohan again, the forest now behind them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf whistled a tune into the wind.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It is said that the Meeras were the most intelligent of horses and superior in both speed and strength, and that only the Kings of Rohan and their sons could mount them, and of course, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The horse approached Gandalf, who bowed his head to him, and then extended a hand and was granted permission to stroke the horse’s nose.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf climbed atop Shadowfax, with no saddle or stirrup, much to Faramir’s wonder, and the others also mounted the horses that Éomer had lent them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir sat beside Legolas and Gimli, keeping themselves warm by the campfire as Aragorn and Gandalf spoke quietly among themselves, looking off towards the east.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Don’t you think this Gandalf is grumpier than the old one?” Gimli whispered, making both Faramir and Legolas chuckle slightly at his words.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Though in truth, Gandalf’s return had lifted their spirits immeasurably.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf and Aragorn joined them around the fire and soon the group began to sleep, everyone apart from Faramir, and Gandalf, apparently, who approached the younger man.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“There is no need to be on guard tonight, Faramir,” Gandalf said, observing that he looked alert rather than sleepy, “Shadowfax will awake us if there is any danger.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked at him sympathetically, knowing all too well of how the Steward’s words haunted his younger son.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It was not one of those dreams, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That is not me, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir bowed his head, staring into the fire, ashamed of his dream and not wanting to see the look in Gandalf’s eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>How could he bare to see disappointment in Gandalf’s eyes, the one who had always supported him?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What would Gandalf think of Faramir becoming such a heartless man, one that watched his own father die?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Rather than disgust, he saw compassion in Gandalf’s eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf dancing to the hobbit’s tunes would truly be a sight for everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s words had put his mind at ease, and he vowed to think upon his dream no more.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir noted that they looked just as unhappy as the rest of Edoras, though it was clear that they were acquainted with Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame,” their leader said, “by order of Gríma Wormtongue.” The guard’s eyes darkened as he said the name, spitting his words out.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf nodded, and they all reluctantly agreed to hand their weapons over.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Your staff,” the guard said, and Faramir saw that Gandalf had made no move to hand over his staff.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The guard looked worried, possible afraid that Gandalf might try something, or maybe it was that he feared Gríma and his repercussions, but after a moment had passed, he nodded and turned around, leading them into the Golden Hall.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Playing the part of old man, Gandalf leaned slightly on Legolas, but turned back to playfully wink at Faramir, Aragorn and Gimli, which brought smiles to their faces.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir also noted that Gandalf had kept his staff our of view to those in front of them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late, Théoden King,” Gandalf said, his voice echoing around the room.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Why should I welcome you, Gandalf Stormcrow?” The King looked to Gríma for support in the same way a child would look to his father, and Gríma whispered something in his ear once more.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gríma chose to step forward then to address Gandalf, inching forward with every word he spoke.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Be silent,” Gandalf commanded, making Gríma stop speaking immediately.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The guards who had been lurking in the shadows moved to attack Gandalf, but he was allowed to move forward towards Théoden, as Faramir and the others fought them off.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There were not many guards, only those who seemed to be in Gríma’s counsel as the guards in the Rohirric armour were more than happy to let Gandalf help their King, and they made no moves to intervene and protect the guards who were being subdued by Faramir and the others.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf began to speak to Théoden, obviously beginning the process of returning him to his former self, but Faramir was too busy fighting off the guards to listen to the words he was saying.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>With the guards now dealt with, Faramir watched as Gandalf tried to free Théoden from the spell which he had put under.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You have no power here, Gandalf the Grey.” Angered, Gandalf threw off his grey cloak, revealing his white robes, and Théoden was blinded by a bright light, the same light that had blinded Faramir in Fangorn Forest a few days before.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound,” Gandalf said as he thrusted his staff forward again, throwing Théoden back in his chair.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“If I go, Théoden dies,” Saruman told Gandalf through Théoden.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf advanced further, staff in the air and he threw Théoden back, so he was crushed further against his throne.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Be gone,” Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Suddenly, Théoden jumped from his throne and lunged at Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Expecting this, Gandalf thrusted him back with his staff and he fell back onto his throne in a heap.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Breathe the free air again, my friend,” Gandalf said as he approached him, a smile upon his face.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Your fingers would remember their strength better if they grasped your sword,” Gandalf said, and the guards stepped forward with the King’s sword in hand.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He saw very little of Gandalf over the three day period in Edoras, as he was deep in counsel with Théoden King, making sure that he was up to date with everything, and so this meant he hadn’t had the opportunity to speak with the King, or Lady Éowyn, for that matter, as she spent all her time by her Uncle’s side, reluctant to leave him now he was back to normal, or perhaps afraid that if she wasn’t near, it would all be a dream.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>At first, Faramir thought there was a problem with Théoden and Gandalf, who they could see from their position atop the hill in Edoras, for that was where he seemed to be looking.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir and Aragorn had carried the two children back to Meduseld and left them with servants in the Golden Hall, whilst Legolas and Gimli headed down to the fields outside of Edoras to inform Gandalf and Théoden of their new arrivals.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir looked around the room, seeing that Théoden now sat on his throne, Gandalf beside him, both with anguish on their face.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron,” Gandalf explained.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He turned to Gandalf and spoke, “I know what it is you want of me, but I will not bring further death to my people.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As much as Faramir agreed with Gandalf that action needed to be taken in order to stop Saruman, he also understood Théoden very well.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Then what is your decision?” Gandalf asked, and Théoden hesitated for a moment.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Théoden went to his rooms to prepare himself for leaving, and when he left, Gandalf stood and let out a sigh of frustration.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The city was busier than Faramir imagined it could be, and Gandalf was heading towards the stables in the opposite direction to everyone else meaning they had to fight their way through the crowd.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“They flee to the mountains when they should stay and fight,” Gimli said, struggling to keep up with the fast pace that Gandalf was setting.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They had reached the stables, and in no time at all, Gandalf had found the stall that Shadowfax was in and let him out, mounting him immediately.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“The Grey Pilgrim,” Gandalf mumbled, “that’s what they used to call me.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And then, Gandalf was gone, speeding away on Shadowfax, to where, Faramir knew not, but Gandalf never did anything without purpose, and he trusted his judgement.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was so strong to the point where Faramir almost believed the horse could actually understand him, and Gandalf had often said that the bond he shared with animals, in particular Anorroch and Beridan, reminded him of the elves, something that Faramir always took pride in.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Though they coped well without Gandalf, losing Aragorn was different.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Many people, his Uncle and Gandalf included, had called it the ‘gift’ of foresight, but Faramir would always scoff at that, for he did not see it as a gift, and he would be glad to be rid of it, though he knew this dream in particular was important, and despite it obviously being the middle of the night still, he had to speak to Théoden King.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>After all these years, Gandalf was right, possessing the gift of foresight could be a tremendous ally.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>A man who, despite being so far away, Faramir recognised immediately as Gandalf, and Gandalf was then joined by several other men on horses, who came charging towards them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir could now see that they were very close to Isengard, and the journey involved a short trip through Fangorn Forest, which seemed much less daunting than it did a few days ago when they had been reunited with Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“We’re under orders from Treebeard, who’s taken over management of Isengard,” Merry said, gesturing towards what Faramir had thought was a tree, but he realised his mistake as the tree moved to approach them, greeting Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Rather than speaking to Gandalf, as Faramir expected him too, or hurl insults at the hobbits who had managed to outwit him, something Faramir would like to hear the tale of later, Saruman goaded Théoden.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What do you want Gandalf Grayhame?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You were deep in the enemy’s counsel,” Gandalf pleaded with his old friend, desperate for any information which could aid them in their fight against Sauron, but Saruman merely laughed at Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was broke out of his thoughts as Saruman fired a bolt of something towards Gandalf, and he held his breath for a minute before realising that Gandalf was fine.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Whatever Saruman had conjured did not affect Gandalf in the slightest, and he spoke up to his old friend.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Whilst he and Éomer had been talking, it appeared that Gríma had made the decision to remain alongside Saruman, who was cast from the order of wizards and the White Council by Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir felt ill at ease to leave them here, but Gandalf was right, as always, with the ents surrounding him, there was no better place to keep an eye on him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was only when Gandalf called his name that Pippin looked away, and reluctantly handed it to the wizard, who hid it in his robe.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir only hoped Gandalf would keep a close eye on the Palantír, for he knew that while they were useful to gain information and communicate, they could also cause damage in the wrong hands.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Frodo and Sam are captured by Faramir the day after Gandalf leaves with Pippin for Minas Tirith, but they appear in different books/movies.As mentioned in the intro, the next chapter won't likely be uploaded for a fortnight at least.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I don’t know what has happened to them since, but as far as I am aware, Gandalf is the only one we have lost.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf is dead?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn struggled with the powerful object, and it eventually dropped to the floor and was covered by Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf ran over to the hobbit, and whispered something, and Faramir felt a great sense of relief wash over him when Pippin blinked and let out a large breath.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf whispers to Pippin, who whispers back.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Faramir!” Gandalf called from across the room.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s words sat uneasy with Faramir as he walked through the corridors of Edoras.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Forgive my intrusion,” he said, aware of the eyes of Théoden’s guards that were now upon him, “but Gandalf requests your presence.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Théoden rushed past him to meet with Gandalf, and when he returned to the room, he noted that Pippin was now sat up, no longer frozen in fear.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring,” Gandalf explained, to the relief of everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf noted that Sauron was now aware that the Heir of Elendil has come forth, and how the enemy is beginning to fear the strength of men, and the strength they could hold combined.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“They will be,” Gandalf said, and then whispered something to Aragorn.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What was said, Faramir did not hear, but as with everything Gandalf said, it was obviously important.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I ride for Minas Tirith, and I will not be going alone,” Gandalf now announced to the group, gesturing towards Pippin.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Everyone sprang into action then, and Faramir made his way over to Gandalf to volunteer to ride to Minas Tirith alongside the pair of them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘Would it hurt him to show it every once in a while?’ Faramir thought to himself but smiled outwardly as Gandalf patted him on the back before heading off on Shadowfax.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was then that he acknowledged the second man who had entered his room, his friend and mentor, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I must say, Faramir, I did not expect to see you back in the city so soon.” His tone was almost accusing, for Gandalf had told Faramir to stay in Edoras rather than return to Minas Tirith, but Faramir explained what he had seen in his vision, and though he assured them that both Frodo and Sam escaped unharmed and with the Ring, Gandalf was deeply unsettled by what he had to say.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Boromir understood in the end,” Faramir defended, not wanting his brother to be thought of in the same ilk as his father, but Gandalf merely grinned.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Give the poor man a chance to breathe before bombarding him with questions!” Gandalf barked, and Pippin looked rather sheepish, a faint blush appearing on his cheeks.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf, they took the road towards Cirith Ungol.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s eyes went wide in horror at Faramir’s words, and Pippin sensed the air had changed, the smile leaving his face.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“What does that mean, Gandalf?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Why?” Gandalf asked Faramir, ignoring Pippin, who continued to ask questions.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gollum?” Faramir nodded, and Gandalf seemed deep in thought.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked out the window, towards the east where the black cloud was heading ever closer to the city.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir knew what he looked for, and he wondered if Gandalf had a guilty conscience for sending the two hobbits on this mission, a mission that the more Faramir thought of it, the less confident he was of the two surviving the return journey, though he did not voice that thought with anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I hear your father did not take well to your absence,” Gandalf said, changing the subject.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s mouth turned upwards in a small smile at Faramir’s words, which confused the younger man, for it was not often Gandalf was amused by Denethor’s treatment of his younger son.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I haven’t seen him since yesterday morning,” Gandalf asked, quickly changing the subject after a silence had descended upon them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I hope I did not cause too much trouble in lighting the beacons,” Pippin said, and now Faramir was aware of what he had been wondering just moments previously, “but Gandalf said it was of utmost importance that I succeeded.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I should’ve guessed Gandalf had something to do with it.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf didn’t explain.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He told Imrahil about every detail he could remember at Rivendell, and how Gandalf had fallen in Moria.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had spoken of how without the aid of Rohan, Gondor did not have the numbers to survive a siege of this magnitude, and if they were already at the fourth circle, it would only be a matter of time before they reached the top.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was losing hope that Rohan had answered the call of aid from Gondor when Pippin and Gandalf had gone behind Denethor's back and lit the beacons.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had explained to him that the siege would hold for some time, but if they were not helped, it would take a miracle for the siege to completely work, and the Black Riders he could hear screeching in the distance were surely not helping the matter.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The only person he knew well enough in the city to ask for help was Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was on the sixth circle, helping the archers and soldiers with trebuchets to defend the lower levels.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf shouted after seeing him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Gandalf, it's Lord Denethor.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Pippin saw Gandalf's expression change.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir had once told him that Gandalf's visits were often the things he looked forward to most as a child.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He could see Gandalf was conflicted between remaining on the walls and helping the soldiers there, and rescuing Faramir, who was about to be burned alive.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"The Rohirrim," he heard Gandalf said, and Pippin's heart lightened.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Spirits lifted by the sound of the horn, Gandalf had made his decision.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf seemed to know the building which Pippin was describing, for he was turning corners before Pippin had told him which way to travel.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf threw the doors open, and to his relief, there was no sign of fire, but Denethor had a torch in his arms, and he and Gandalf were talking to one another, shouting was perhaps a better word to use, but Pippin was not listening to them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf, knowing that Faramir was still in grave danger, placed him back upon the stretcher and rushed him back to the Houses of Healing with Beregond.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He turned to find Gandalf approaching him, a grave look upon his face.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn was confused, but was now used to Gandalf's ways and followed, knowing that Gandalf would have only come to find him if it was urgent.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"I am sure by now, you are aware that the Witch King has been slain," Gandalf said, and Aragorn nodded.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Had the words not been from Gandalf's mouth, he would struggle to believe it, but Gandalf would not tell lies in such a moment.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Rather than joyous at the news of their victory, however, Gandalf still looked grieved.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"They call it the Black Breath," Gandalf explained, and Aragorn gulped.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"We must hurry Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf explained what had happened to Faramir, how he had been struck by a Harad dart and badly poisoned, and that is where Gandalf believed the Black Breath took its hold on him, for all nine of the Nazgûl surrounded the battlefield.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But being brought to the Houses did not end Faramir's anguish, for his father, the Steward Denethor, had taken it upon himself to build a pyre to burn both father and son upon, though fortunately Pippin and Gandalf had managed to save Faramir.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As they approached the door to which Faramir was behind, Gandalf stopped, and whispered.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Good Lady, Ioreth," Gandalf said, approaching the Healer, "I have brought you the help I promised."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Gandalf said it was called the Black Breath," Boromir said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He could also sense anguish and stress at his relationship with his father, and he now realised why Gandalf did not want Faramir learning of Denethor's death too soon, for it would crush him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Eagerly awaiting news were Boromir and Imrahil, as well as Pippin and Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Easy now,” a voice said, and Gandalf walked into his room, approaching the bed in which Faramir lay.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Now that is just the shadow talking, I do not think it has fully departed yet, nor do I think it will for some time.” Faramir tried to listen to Gandalf’s words, but he was overcome with a huge sense of doom and worthlessness.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Listen to me, Faramir,” Gandalf said, unusually stern.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was tired of Gandalf trying to persuade him that the dreams he rather ironically lost sleep over were a gift.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf made sense, a lot of sense, but Faramir supposed it mattered no more.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I must be going,” Gandalf said, standing and heading towards the door.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf warned me this could happen.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I understand that this Black Breath or whatever it is has put you in a dark place, and Gandalf seems to think it will be hard to escape, but first, stop blaming yourself for these men’s deaths.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And then there are your Rangers, Gandalf, and this Aragorn and the other friends you’ve met on your journey also care a great deal about you.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf and the Healers do not wish me to tell you this whilst you are not recovered, but I believe you have the right to know before we depart this evening.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Faramir, are you well?” Imrahil asked, his concern growing and he thought that perhaps Gandalf was right, and Faramir was not ready to hear this news.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was grateful he was able to speak to Boromir, Imrahil and Gandalf before they left, and his mind was ever drawn to them as they marched.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir had also been told by Imrahil that Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Gandalf were unharmed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was Gandalf who placed the crown upon Aragorn’s head.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When he entered the room, he saw that the other three hobbits and Gandalf were there already, and Frodo beamed at him when he saw him enter, making Faramir feel that everything that had happened over the last year had been worth it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I do hope I will have an invitation to your wedding, young man,” Gandalf said, as he walked by, preparing to escort the hobbits home.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>For those such as Aragorn and Gandalf, whom Faramir would see very soon, the farewells were quick, for he would be reunited with them soon.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>Gandalf!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was announced next, and the old man nodded and turned his solemn attention to Frodo.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Bring out the Ring, Frodo!” Gandalf said grimly, “The time has come.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Stranger things have occurred, but never such as an enemy wizard!” And listening again he heard the tale of the capture of the creature Gollum, and how Aragorn and Gandalf had pressed it for all the information it had.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Then the room felt colder and Faramir looked suddenly to Gandalf as he repeated from memory the curse of the Ring:<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Never before has any voice dared to utter words of that tongue in Imladris, Gandalf the Grey,” Elrond said as the darkness passed and the company collectively took a breath.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“And let us hope that none will ever speak it here again,” Answered Gandalf quietly, “Nonetheless I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Then, Gandalf said: “We should seek a final end of this menace, even if we do not hope to make one.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But ready yourself for a sequel when they return!” Said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“The messengers who are to be sent with the Ring.” Gandalf said calmly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was decided, after the Council came together once more, that Gandalf too would join the messengers in their task.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>By the end of their search, Merry, Pippin, Samwise, Gandalf, and Aragorn had all joined as well.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>For a short while, Gandalf and a small chosen few had set out in search of the Black Riders which had apparently come searching at Lord Elrond’s doorstep.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Farewells were given in the great hall by the fire, and with all the company gathered, they waited only for Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Then, out from the doors came Elrond and Gandalf and Elrond said: “This is my last word.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
For a fortnight they traveled until reaching the borders of the land Gandalf had proclaimed Hollin.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had hummed discontentedly; no, had Pippin 

not

 examined the maps of the land like all else in the company?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Master Gimli, we make for Dimrill Dale, if we climb Redhorn Gate on the far side of Caradhras, we shall come to Dimrill Stair, and then to Mirrormere and the Silverlode!” Said Gandalf, coming over to where Gimli sat.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Moving to the front, Faramir came beside Gandalf and Aragorn.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“But what do you guess is the reason?” Gandalf said with interest: “It is enough surprise to see four hobbits, not to mention the rest of our merry band.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Then we must be more careful,” Said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked about and whispered: “We must stop talking aloud, rest quietly, and set the watch.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>To Gandalf, Aragorn rushed, and to Legolas, Faramir did the same.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“And in that case, then so,” Said Gandalf grimly, “is Redhorn Gate, and how we can get over that without being seen, I cannot imagine.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Then came Gandalf, and Faramir saw his long eyebrows poking out from the edge of his wide brimmed hat.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf snuffed the air and turned to the men.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What do you think of our course now, Aragorn?” Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Who knows indeed!” Gandalf said, and then a thought crossed his face and he said: “But there is another way, a dark, secret way, that we have not yet spoken of.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We must face Caradhras with all the swiftness of an eagle, come snow or misfortune, we must continue.” Aragorn said quietly, looking to Gandalf solemnly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf and Aragorn nodded.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Then Gandalf turned and told the Fellowship of the decision and what was advised.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Slowly, Faramir made his way to Gandalf and said as his teeth rattled: “‘Tis not as bad as I hoped but Gandalf!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“His arm would have then grown long indeed!” Said Gimli from behind, “To trouble us here three hundred leagues away!” Gandalf looked at the sky pensively, “His arm is long….”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
The company nodded and looked to Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf then took up the sticks and with a word of command, 

naur an edraith ammen!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I have written 

Gandalf is here

 in the flames so if there is any to see, then at least I am revealed.” Said Gandalf, placing the wood upon the ground, and at once the company rejoiced and joined about the fire.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“If Gandalf were to light a flame we could escape this cool prison.” Said Legolas, looking at the snow in wonder for the snow troubled him little and he alone remained still light of heart.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“If Elves could fly over mountains, they might fetch the Sun to save us!” Grumbled Gandalf, and then quietly he said: “I cannot burn snow.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It is no use!” He said turning to Gandalf, “We cannot help it now, whether they be good or evil, we cannot continue.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf nodded and spoke loudly: “We must go down at once!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf again passed around the 

miruvor 

from his pack and after each had broken their fast and drank, he called council of the company.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“We cannot go forward to Redhorn Gate as of now,” Said Gandalf, warming his hands above the fire Gimli had made, “Our journey remains ahead of us and now we have no choice but to go on or return to Rivendell.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“You are right Frodo,” Said Gandalf, “To go back is to admit defeat, and face worse defeat to come, yet… I see it - a way in which we could pass through the mountains,”  Gandalf brought out his pipe and lit it, “but it is more evil than Redhorn Gate.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“I cannot say, my thoughts turned to it only twice: once before our quest, and once I spoke of it to Aragorn, but he was against it, at least ‘til the pass of the mountains had been tried.” Gandalf puffed his pipe, his expression dark.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“The road I speak of leads to the Mines of Moria.” Gandalf said, and at once Gimli’s head lifted and in his eyes was a keen light of interest.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“What dark things dwell in there that Gandalf himself dreads?” Worried he.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“We must try.” Said Gandalf, “Since our forlorn travels on Caradhras, our plight has become more desperate.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I will tread it with you Gandalf!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Of course not!” Gandalf said, “Who would?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>For you followed my lead through chilling snow, but I warn you Gandalf!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“I do not wish to go to Moria.” Said Legolas softly, “But I will follow where Aragorn or Gandalf lead.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I do not wish to go,” Frodo finally said, “but neither do I wish to forsake the advice of Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Then let us be off,” Said Gandalf wearily, “The door lies south-west of Caradhras, some fifteen miles as the crow flies.” And so the company hastened through the night and day, until they came across a barren country close to Moria.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gimli walked by the heels of Gandalf, so eager was he to come to the halls of his forefathers.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Well, here we are at last!” Said Gandalf, “This door itself is a great testament to the friendship of Elves and Dwarves in Elder Days gone past.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The doors are shut and hidden, and the sooner we find them the better, for night is at hand!” Said Gandalf and he sighed loudly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Until at last, Gandalf found a smooth grooved wall of stone, and muttered words of magic under his breath and Lo!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Come now Gandalf, what does it say?” Asked Pippin eagerly as he stared at the shining door.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It seems to me that these doors are governed by words, and the word to this door has in no doubt been forgotten.” Said Gandalf thoughtfully.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“But Gandalf, you mentioned that you had passed through these Mines before.” Said Sam worriedly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I did not come this way.” Gandalf replied.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf’s eyebrows bristled and he turned to Pippin sharply.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>If that does not shatter them, I am allowed a little peace from foolish questions and I will seek for the opening words.” Said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Into the gateway!” Shouted Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“I do not know, Master Samwise, I do not know… “ Came Gandalf’s voice from somewhere in front of Faramir, “Now, let us have some light, and see if we can make our way in this deadly dark!” And soon, a bright light shone from the wizard’s wooden staff.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“How long do you expect us to travel in this dim cavern, Gandalf?” Said Faramir, taking a sip of miruvor; the wizard had passed the flask about again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf led the weary company, Glamdring grasped in his left hand, and his twisted staff shining in his right.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf and Gimli led the way, sometimes pausing to converse, for even the Mines of Moria were intricate for one of dwarf-kind.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I have followed Gandalf into darker pits and if there is any path to find, he will find it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They travelled again for hours until at last Gandalf came to his first serious check.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“I have no memory of this place at all…” Said Gandalf, leaning against his staff like it would help him remember.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“What’s that?” Cried Gandalf, and soon Pippin had confessed that he had dropped a stone into the well.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Fool of a Took!” Gandalf growled, “This is a serious journey, not a hobbit walking-party!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That is a signal if I ever heard one,” He whispered to Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Yes…” Said Gandalf quietly, “And I do not like it.” Then turning to Pippin he said: “You, Pippin, can go on first watch as a reward for your foolishness.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf woke the Fellowship later, and announced that he had made up his mind and that they were to take the right stair.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“I have chosen well,” Said Gandalf, pleased with himself, “But tonight, we will rest here, and seek for better ways on the morrow.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Since Faramir gazed about, he missed most of Sam, Gimli, and Gandalf’s conversation, but he heard the words “

mithril

” “

Thorin

” and “

Bilbo

,” and he thought back to the Council and remembered the frail hobbit that told his tale of the finding of the Ring.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
At length, they woke to another day, and over breakfast Gandalf announced that this would be their last day in Moria, for everyone was loathe to spend another night in its dark halls, no matter the previous splendour.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Maybe,” Said Gandalf, “But I guess we are above and to the north of the Great Gates; and it may not be easy to find the right road down to them.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
And Faramir watched as Frodo and Gandalf came to the stone, and listened as Gandalf read the inscription: “These are Daeron’s Runes, such as were used of old in Moria.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He looked upon it for a long time in silence before he heard Gandalf speaking: “It seems to be a record of the fortunes of Balin’s folk,” He said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“The Chamber of Records?” Said Gimli hoarsely, “I guess that is where we now stand.” Gandalf ushered for Gimli to come to his side, and continued to read out what he could.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“And here is the last page…” Gandalf sighed, “I fear their end was cruel.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There is nothing more... “ Gandalf stood in silent thought.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf looked around and said: “They seem to have made their last stand by both doors,” He sighed, “So ended the attempt to retake Moria!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I now know where we are!” Answered Gandalf, and he relayed his knowledge on where they should travel next to leave the dark of the Mines.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But, Gandalf had hardly spoken when there came a great, rumbling noise: a rolling 

Boom 

that sounded as though to come from the very depths below.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“No!” Gandalf said, “We must not be shut in.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Do not close it yet!” Said Gandalf, he sprang to Faramir’s side and drew himself up to a great height, the air about him growing ever darker.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Quickly, Gandalf stepped before Faramir and flashed a light from his staff.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There is no hope of escape that way.” Said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Then, the footsteps grew heavier and louder, and swiftly, Faramir and Gandalf wedged the Western door with broken swords and crushed shields.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And, being afeard, the orcs rushed out of the chamber, above the din Gandalf shouted: “Now is the time!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“We must go now!” Shouted Gandalf as he helped cut the spear protruding from Frodo’s chest.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Not yet!” Gandalf said, “But quickly, down the stairs!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir looked back, and saw nothing, save for the small glimmer of Gandalf’s staff.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Then at once came Gandalf in a rush, and the wizard stumbled and landed upon the dusty floor.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Come!” Said Gandalf, and he gestured for Gimli to follow him in lead.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“What could be worse than orcs?” Thought he as the drum beats echoed in the dark, “Whatever great evil it be, it seems to have shaken Gandalf thoroughly, and that is no minor feat!”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Soon the Fellowship groped the walls in silence, the sound of pursuit far behind them, and Gandalf led them forward, using his staff to feel his way like a blind man.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>After traveling a mile in the dark and descending at least seven flights of stairs, Gandalf halted.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>If an orc band sprang upon us now I do not think I could muster even the strength to speak!” And Gandalf made motion to sit on the stair.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Faramir walked beside Frodo and began examining his chest as Gimli and Gandalf conversed, it would not do for the hobbit to swoon as of now.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It is red.” The dwarf looked at Gandalf, “What can it be?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Still… we can only go on.” Said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“There is some evil here -” Faramir began to say, but he saw Gandalf had stopped.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Let us hope fire is not what lies between us and pursuit.” Murmured Gandalf, “Come!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Indeed!” Said Gandalf, “But look ahead!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Now I understand…” Said Gandalf, and Faramir did too.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Fly!” Cried Gandalf, “Fly!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
The Balrog reached the Bridge, and Gandalf stood tall and erect in the middle of the span, and further behind him stood Aragorn and Faramir, poised with their swords shining, ready to run to the Bridge again at any moment.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It raised its whip and brought it down with a crashing crack, fire burning in its hideous nostrils, and yet, still Gandalf did not falter.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“You cannot pass,” Gandalf said, and a great quiet fell, for even the orcs became silent, “I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Go back to the shadow!” Then in a great booming voice, Gandalf cried once more aloud: “You cannot pass!”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>there stood Gandalf, his small figure proud in defiance of evil.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I am with you Gandalf!” Shouted Aragorn.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
But, at that moment, Gandalf lifted his staff and with a cry aloud his smote the Bridge before him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir froze and watched in horror as Gandalf’s staff broke asunder and fell from his right hand.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But it was too late, Gandalf staggered and fell, and grasped vainly at the stone, and slid into the abyss.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Then, with a sinking sensation, Faramir’s thoughts turned to Gandalf, their leader, his friend.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>we cannot stay here… Farewell Gandalf!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf dying like that -” Sam paused and took a deep breath, “He was a fine friend if I ever had one.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I remember Gandalf’s words as clear as the waters, but no joy does the deep bring me, for he remains, and I must flee.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Mithril!” Exclaimed Gimli in wonder, “Is this the mail-coat Gandalf spoke of?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir still refused to let his thoughts return to Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf the Grey set out with the Company, but did not pass into the borders of this land.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Alas!” Said Aragorn, “Gandalf the Grey fell into shadow.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It could be said that in his final hours, Gandalf fell from wisdom into folly, going needlessly into the web of Moria.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life,” Said Galadriel gravely, “Those that have followed him knew not his mind nor purpose.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Then, Celeborn apologized, and told of Gandalf’s days in the West.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And had not my designs gone amiss Gandalf the Grey would have governed, but it is not so, and if it had mayhap things would have gone otherwise.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Eventually, the companions began to speak of Gandalf, but Faramir never took part in their conversation.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But, often he heard the music of the Elves, and Legolas explained that it was a mourning song for Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was our guide and I admit you probably knew of his plans, but not me!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“No.” Faramir said softly, “You are more worthy than I. Gandalf saw that.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“But Gandalf is gone.” Said Aragorn angrily.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Us.” Said Aragorn icily, “But you cannot see it.” Then Aragorn walked away, and Faramir stared quietly at the ground until his resolve broke, and he fell to the forest floor, weeping for Gandalf, his brother, and his home.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Beyond Lothlórien I do not know what Gandalf intended to do.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Under their shadow Elessar, the Elfstone son of Arathorn of the House of Valandil Isildur’s son, heir of Elendil, has naught to dread!” But then the visage of King’s fell from Aragorn and he was small again, and he spoke to himself: “Would that Gandalf were here!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He had accepted it all: Aragorn’s doubt, Gandalf’s fall, and his longing for home, and he felt anew.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>In this matter, I cannot advise you, for I am not Gandalf, and though I have tried to bear his part I do not know what design he had for this hour or whether he had one at all.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“It is as Gandalf feared then,” Said Gimli as he helped Faramir up again, “The West is no longer safe.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He must know of Gandalf’s fall… The 

crebain

!” Faramir staggered a bit in excitement.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>For though we have lost Merry and Pippin-” Faramir cast his eyes downward again, “-we have not  lost  anyone but Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Perhaps some bout of sorcery was done here?” Said Gimli, he brushed Legolas’ arm in comfort, “However, it cannot be Gandalf… Perhaps it was Saruman with a wicked plan of his?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Did not Gandalf say once that Saruman had many spies?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir stared, for here in splendour was Gandalf, though he was changed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf!” He said, “Gandalf!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf!”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf…” The old man said, “Yes, that is what I once was called… Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You may still call me Gandalf.” He stepped down from the rock and wrapped his grey cloak round once more and at once it seemed like the sun had been covered by a cloud, for his brightness was diminished.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No, I did not find them,” Said Gandalf, “I did not know of their plight until a great friend relayed it to me.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Did he?” Said Gandalf, a twinkle in his eye, “It is news to me, yet it does not surprise me.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf said nothing, but listened intently, committed - it seemed - to recall all he had lost.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>At last, when the Hunters had finished, it was Gandalf’s turn.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“And one last message I have for you four.” Said Gandalf, as his story came to a close.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf fell silent and shut his eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir looked around once more: Gandalf’s eyes were still shut.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I was pondering the messages once more.” Gandalf said, opening his eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You have come in a happy hour Gandalf!” At once, the dwarf sang loudly in his natural tongue, joyful, for all to hear.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Come!” He shouted, making his way to the sloping end of the shelf, “Since Gandalf’s head is now sacred, let us find one that it is right to cleave!”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Come!” Said Gandalf, gesturing to Aragorn and Faramir, “We have spent enough time together as parted friends.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Now is the time to act!” They walked swiftly down from the shelf, and followed Gandalf through the wood of Fangorn and out again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf huffed, “I shall not walk.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Time presses too much!” Then Gandalf gave a long whistle, which rang clear in the dimming light and amazed all.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We are going to battle together.” At last, the horses gathered, Aragorn and Faramir mounted Hasufel, Gimli and Legolas rode Arod, and Gandalf at the head upon Shadowfax.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“There lies the Gap of Rohan,” said Gandalf, “It is now almost West of us.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Battle and War!” Said Gandalf, “Ride on!”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Then we must raise our speed.” Aragorn said, and Faramir felt the Man turn in his seat and lock eyes with Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Not long!” Cried Gandalf, “Look!”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“It is called Edoras!” Said Gandalf, and he pointed to the highest hill, whereupon sat a great hall.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I will be your counsel until we reach the King’s court.” Said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf pointed to a green mound, upon it grew small white flowers; “

Simbelmynë

,” He said, “Men call them so, and often they grow on Men’s graves.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They cried out to Gandalf, and Faramir watched amazed as the Wizard answered in the same tongue.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“We have not come unbidden surely,” Aragorn said, he leant back against Faramir only a little, “Gandalf was bid to return with Shadowfax, and Théoden is a companion he has known long.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
One of the guards stepped forward inclined his head to Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We are not so ill mannered to resist a King at his door-step.” Said Gandalf, and easily he relinquished his sword into the hands of the Doorward.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Háma hesitated, and looked disconsolate at Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Nonsense!” Cried Gandalf, “Is the King to deny an old man his cane!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There was a silence, in which, Gandalf walked forward, his arms outstretched in greeting.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Then, Théoden’s eyes at last caught Gandalf’s and he cleared his throat.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I greet you, travellers, and maybe you seek welcome under my roof, but I doubt you shall find it here, Master Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Tell me, Gandalf Stormcrow, why should I welcome you?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He turned his head ever slightly and saw Aragorn looking intently at Gandalf as he spoke.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“The courtesy of your hall has lessened as of late, Théoden of Thengel,” Gandalf eyed the bent King in his throne, “Has not the messenger at your gate reported the name of my companions.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Then, Gandalf began to sing:<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
As Gandalf sang, Faramir noticed a change.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I have not passed through fire and death to hear bandy crooked words with a serving-man till the lightning falls!” Then Gandalf raised his staff high, and there was a great roll of thunder.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Will you not ask for help?” Said Gandalf softly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Upon reaching the great door to the hall, Gandalf rapted against the door and cried: “Open!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir turned to his companions: Aragorn stood thoughtful by his side, watching Gandalf and Théoden exchange sparse words with interest.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Theoden turned to Gandalf and said not in the voice of an old man but clear and hard: “Dark have been my dreams of late, but I feel as one new-awakened.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I would now that you had come before, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Their horses ran swiftly; Théoden and Gandalf led the procession, Snowmane and Shadowfax ever diligent.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Likely Aragorn, Gandalf, and Éomer are making counsel inside.” Faramir thought, turning his gaze away.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Then they went to the tent; inside they found Théoden and Gandalf deep in council, and Aragorn was bent over a map, tracing the lines of past paths with his finger.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Then, Faramir saw that Gandalf had ridden ahead.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“And what of Gandalf?” Called Gimli.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That is bitter news for him,” Laughed the King, “No luck will be with Wormtongue, if Gandalf is behind him.” He paused then, on Snowmane, and thought.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf!” He cried merrily, and behind him in the crowd he heard Legolas’ clear voice also cry: “ Mithrandir!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf, the White Rider, came upon them, and they fled like cats from water.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>- Gandalf<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They're here because gunpowder exists (Gandalf's fireworks) and I couldn't think of another plausible way to destroy the bridge.5.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>Gandalf the Gray, Wizard of the immortal Istari, returned to the White City during a rainy autumn, once again searching for the One Ring.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sensed that the long-awaited time of crisis was approaching.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>A conversation he had with his fellow Wizard Radagast the Brown had led Gandalf to think of the Library and archives of ancient Minas Tirith.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf suppressed an oath upon realizing how many records from the time of Isildur there were in the library of Gondor.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf, called Mithrandir by the humans of Gondor, looked up to the welcome sight of the Lady Finduilas, the wife of the Steward of Gondor.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was very interested in making the acquaintance of Finduilas’ offspring, and was fond of human children (in fact, all children) in general.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Beginning to gather up his research to keep it safe from small and possibly sticky fingers, Gandalf greeted “Lady Finduilas, always a pleasure.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf found his eyes captured by a remarkably solemn and piercing gaze.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“But I see Gandalf has a set of newer books here – copies of older documents.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’m good at that.” the young Gondorian Lord offered, meeting Gandalf’s eyes with sincere desire to help.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Can you spell it in those languages?” Gandalf asked in growing surprise.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Turning to Gandalf, Finduilas offered.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Smiling at the offer of real help at last, Gandalf explained how the object he was looking for disappeared not long after the Last Alliance of men and elves, when it had been in the possession of Isildur.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Anything like that.” Gandalf smiled as Finduilas took a goodly portion of the old manuscripts he had gathered, and proceeded to peruse them with delicate skill.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Were it not for the fine lines on the lady’s face, it could have been twenty years ago, the teenaged Finduilas offering to help Gandalf search the archives of Dol Amroth in exchange for hearing her favorite stories once again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As the afternoon wore on, Gandalf found his attention straying from his search in the old manuscripts, to the fey Lady and her grave younger child.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sincerely hoped that the rumors of her health further deteriorating were untrue.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf would miss Finduilas for her own sake, for he had allowed himself to care for the girl as he did few humans, but he would mourn her even more for the loss of her moderating influence on her hot-headed, stubborn husband, Denethor, the Lord Steward of Gondor.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had carefully arranged the marriage of Finduilas to Denethor (so as to bring that bloodline back to Gondor).<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I would not have you wear yourself out.” Gandalf observed gently.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Worry over him?” Gandalf observed the boy more closely.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Boromir will be a great warrior.” Finduilas said “I have seen it – and Faramir shall be as well, though it is not what he would aspire to, in less dark times.” Looking at her more closely, and recalling that Finduilas bore strongly the foresight that sometimes came with Númenorean blood, Gandalf carefully asked “Then what is your concern?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Looking again at the child, still reading diligently, Gandalf asked “You can’t be worried he will mistreat the boy?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Your assistance, and the boy’s, have saved me many days work, and you have been one of my more astute research assistants over the years.” Gandalf explained.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked again at the quiet boy.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf chuckled to hide his unease.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The boy turned his attention to Gandalf and nodded solemnly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Had Gandalf known it was the last time he would see her, he surely would have embraced her.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Turning to Gandalf, the Steward said “As for you, I will keep the promise I made to my father that you can do your research here, old man, but you will not draw my wife into it anymore!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Raising an eyebrow at this excessively hostile greeting, Gandalf had yet to speak before Faramir said “Mother came to the library to fetch a book to read when we encountered Mithrandir.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Where did you hear that?” Gandalf inquired.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Hmm.” Gandalf considered.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf leaned forward, engaged, and at the same time wondering at the oddity of being drawn into a discussion of comparative ethics with a five year old.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Hello, Mithrandir.” Boromir greeted the Wizard politely enough, but in a reserved way that made Gandalf regret that Boromir already seemed to have taken on his father’s wary attitude toward the wizard.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was clear to Gandalf, and to Faramir, that the latter was more of a command than a request.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf chuckled at Faramir’s clever re-construing of Lady Finduilas’ instructions.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Well after midnight, Gandalf the Gray woke to an odd sound in his bedroom chamber.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Taking the Wizard’s shock as a request to please continue, Faramir held the book out, and flipped to a marked page, showing Gandalf a passage that nearly made the Wizard forget completely the time of night and the tender age of this research assistant.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The Lord wrote to his cousin in Minas Tirith that it was sad irony the great lord had survived the siege of Barad-dur, only to fall before a party of orcs.” Faramir, every inch his scholarly mother’s son, looked up at Gandalf, explaining earnestly “Easendor is close to Isildur – adjust for the accent near Gladden fields, and give the scribe who copied this letter into the book a spelling problem, and you’re there.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf nodded absently in agreement, further noting “great man is a reasonable translation of King, particularly given the likelihood the original letter was written in some form of Sindarin.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Lovely beings, elves.” Gandalf commented absently, collecting his travel bags.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You’ll not be away swiftly, and everyone will be upset.” Faramir then fixed Gandalf with a very hard look, for his age and state.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>An eccentric Wizard I may be, but I cannot leave the five year old son of my host to find his own way home.” Gandalf pointed out, impatient to be away, but mindful of his duties.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf would normally not have left the care and discipline of a five year old child to his ten year old brother, but he recalled the strained dinner he had attended in the great hall that evening.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The Steward had not mentioned his younger son once, despite Gandalf praising the lad’s scholarship.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Talking to the young Lord Sendar and the old Captain Tyrel, Gandalf had learned that Denethor never mentioned his younger son if he could help it, despite praising the elder near constantly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Boromir, for his part, had been well-behaved during the formal dinner, far from the boisterous child Gandalf remembered from his previous visits.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was unsurprised when Faramir quietly guided them through hallways, pausing to enter hidden tunnels once or twice to evade guards.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir huffed, and Gandalf pointed out, “Possibly not, in this case.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf nodded.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf felt more and more the pressure to be away, but love for Finduilas, and growing admiration for her children, made him stay.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As Gandalf rode swiftly away from Minas Tirith toward the site where Isildur may have lost the ring, the Gray Wizard decided that he should indeed make a point of returning to the White City on a regular basis.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The story of how Faramir came to be Gandalf's pupil.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf the Gray, called Mithrandir, helped me learn what I would need to wed a Lord of the White City, for he wanted to bring greater elven strength to the blood line of the Stewards of Gondor.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf doesn’t show up in this one, though it was his idea that motivated Faramir to write the essay that brought Denethor’s attention to Faramir.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>In which Gandalf goes to Dol Amroth and does not find what he was looking for, but does come to an unexpected realization, courtesy of the Brothers Hurin and Prince Imrahil's family.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The waterfalls of Imladris sung him to sleep, and Gandalf dreamed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf awoke with a shout.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf replied shortly, "I saw nothing of any use."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It could not be, Gandalf assured himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No, Gandalf had been thinking of the ring, and of Bilbo, whose invitation to visit he had recently declined with regret, and the two unrelated ideas had combined in an illogical manner.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf chuckled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Please," Gandalf interrupted wryly, "Do spare me your ever-flattering description of my dear brother Saruman."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He waited until Gandalf had lit his pipe and begun to relax before asking, "So, if you do find the One Ring, what are you going to do with it?"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Elrond was in a much better mood, and well disposed towards aiding Gandalf in his mission.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The work that Elrond was neglecting in favor of playing archivist was almost entirely falling upon Erestor's shoulders, since Erestor's adopted son Melpomaen, Gandalf's normal research assistant in Imladris, was off knight-erranting with Elrond's twin sons.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Murmured Gandalf, his eyes twinkling.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Terrible, yes indeed, but promising, for Gandalf's purpose.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf scolded.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Elrond reassured Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And so Gandalf the Grey found himself bound for Dol Amroth's sunny shores, just as green spring gave way to summer's sun-drenched splendor.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Also a man well-known to Gandalf from the days that Aragorn Isildurchil had served in Gondor's army and Dol Amroth's navy under the name Thorongil.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And that was just that Gandalf knew of.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Telemnar," Gandalf greeted, preparing to talk his way on to the man's ship, despite the potential of an overexciting voyage - always a possibility which could not be discounted when it came to Telemnar.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stared at the many crates and barrels being off-loaded from the ship, and the greater stack on the dock, clearly intended for Telemnar's holds, and marked for destinations in the opposite direction.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Still, Gandalf felt the need for haste, and accepted the situation without demur.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It wasn't until they were well on their way with a following wind at their backs that Gandalf finally inquired as to his good fortune, "I am glad for the ride, Telemnar, but you clearly lost a small fortune, and did look to be headed home, besides."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf asked, stroking his beard thoughtfully.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It gave Gandalf a great deal to think about, as the stars came out overhead.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Once, many years ago, Adrahil had aided Gandalf in identifying the source of a poison which had been used by Sauron's agents to tracelessly slay many of the Lords and powerful of Gondor.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>On the last, Adrahil had been in his eighties, and he'd endured torture near unto death protecting Gandalf's secrets from orcs and worse at Minas Morgul.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>If Gandalf owed a debt to any man living, it was Prince Adrahil of Dol Amroth.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What he might need now, Gandalf could not even begin to imagine.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>In less time than Gandalf would have thought possible, they were sailing up the harbor towards Adrahil's reddish-pink sandstone castle, the waves blue-green in the mid-morning light.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Taking off a message tube, Telemnar tossed it to Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Whatever urgent matter had impelled him to order Mithrandir brought to him at all haste had apparently been resolved, but Adrahil made clear that Gandalf was still most welcome to Dol Amroth.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>A second parchment, in a scribe's more measured script, promised that Gandalf's room would be made ready for him, and invited him to dine with the Prince and his court that evening.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Adrahil's castellan, a new man whom Gandalf didn't recognize from his last visit some dozen years ago, greeted him at the dock.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf shocked the poor fellow once by carrying only one small satchel, and then shocked him again by insisting on going directly to the castle's largest library.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The young official asked as Gandalf set a rapid pace through cool courtyards full of singing, trilling fountains, shaded by large, sheltering branches, and smaller trees bearing ripe lemons, oranges, and limes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>After finally convincing the man that he did not, Gandalf was able to begin his research, at last.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf the Gray, Wizard and immortal Ithron, paused his research in frustration.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked up to find a grinning eight year old, both taller and tanner than he recalled, but quite unmistakably the late Lady Finduilas' younger son, Lord Faramir of Gondor.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf commented.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>With the assistance of Finduilas' clever son, Gandalf's progress improved rapidly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf, frustrated with the paltry results of their research, barked to Faramir to check the catalog in Quenya.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf considered that for a moment.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf chuckled despite himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf asked, the note of power again in his voice.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf proceeded to explain that he was looking for ways to destroy an object of great evil power.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf held his tongue.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But Gandalf didn't think there was anything to be gained by arguing about it, so he merely instructed Faramir to return to the Quenya catalog and see what he could find.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf scolded.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked at him intently.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf murmured, disturbed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir said, meeting Gandalf's eyes again so that the Wizard could read that he told the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sighed in frustration.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf said bluntly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked at the boy, reconsidering.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf mused aloud in answer, "Mostly Sauron locked these weak objects away in secret rooms, releasing one or another only to cause a specific mischief.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf murmured,  very frustrated, for they had still found nothing about how to defeat the one ring, save taking it to the fires of Mount Doom.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The only elves who had the strength of will to resist the Sauron's call through the rings were too powerful to be allowed near the one ring, just as Gandalf was himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf commanded.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf grunted.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf worried, but the child would explain no more.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>At Adrahil's invitation, Gandalf attended dinner that evening in the breezy great hall of the old sandstone castle.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There appeared to Gandalf to be almost fifty of them, but it might just be that they moved so quickly and made so much noise that every one child seemed more like two or even two and a half.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf did notice that Lords Faramir and Boromir were sitting on opposite ends of the table of children.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He sat with a host of other big, husky young teenagers and pre-teens, including two slightly younger lads whom Gandalf would later learn were Imrahil's heir, Elphir, and his next oldest son, Erchirion.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And though Gandalf knew that Adrahil had been taken aback by his patient and easy-going son, the old sea prince had always been a good father despite his well-known fire, and he loved all of his children and grandchildren deeply.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>During the dinner, Gandalf was amazed to see Denethor's sons acting like children, albeit engaging and well-behaved children, as opposed to curious little miniature adults, and said so.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The following morning found Gandalf in the archives again, continuing with his mission.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That is not to say that Gandalf didn't miss Elrond, or Melpomaen, or, for that matter, Faramir's late mother, but the boy was by any measure of the words a scholastic prodigy.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He lacked the dedication of an adult scholar - he often disappeared in the late afternoons and early evenings, leaving Gandalf to struggle on by himself, and have to interact with the archivists' staff, which was in some ways more annoying.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Having Faramir there to request more parchment and quills, or to politely ask young Lord Boromir's loud friends to go about whatever lesson had sent them to the archives more quietly, was a boon to Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had forgotten, if indeed he'd ever known, that eight year old children were apparently preoccupied with inane jests, the punchlines of which they often forgot or bungled, and the repetition of which they hardly ever tired of.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There were several afternoons when Gandalf had to institute a "no talking except for the mission" rule.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf gave him the afternoon off, hoping that would help.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was somewhat impressed at how Imrahil managed to combine pride and a scold in the same level comment.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Boromir apologized, not with a stunning amount of sincerity, but well enough that Gandalf felt obliged to accept it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was fond of Imrahil, but had little patience for rebukes from a young man who understood so little of what he was trying to do.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf explained tersely, "Faramir has a responsibility that goes along with his intelligence and his heritage.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Imrahil flushed, looking more like his fiery sire than Gandalf had ever seen him before.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf gaped at this firm command from the normally vivacious, easy-going Princess.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf tried to rally his arguments again, even as Adrahil shook his head in warning.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"My dear Lady," Gandalf began, "If I do not use all the resources at my disposal, including your nephew,  young though he may be, there may be no future other than slavery and pain for all your children.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>For the first time in the conversation, Gandalf was truly listening, rather than just waiting out objections he felt were unworthy.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf, at length, conceded the point.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir seemed to care much more for the opinions of his brother and his Dol Amroth kin, and Gandalf could see why.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sought the boy out, intending to apologize.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf decided that was as auspicious a moment for his entrance as he was going to get.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir, with a large bruise on his forehead, was pouting at his brother in a way that made Gandalf think he was about to either burst into tears or say something unfortunate.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The Wizard's arrival spared him either outcome, and although Gandalf had wanted to ask what they were talking about, he kept his focus on something more important.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Still, I should have remembered that a boy your age needs sunshine and rest," Gandalf said kindly, "I will endeavor to do better, in the future.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf berated himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Boromir looked torn between going and staying, but as Gandalf reached the part of the tale of the Quest for Erebor where the dwarves and Bilbo fought the three trolls, the young teenager elected to stay.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Not much to Gandalf's surprise, Boromir liked the battle scenes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He played very close attention during the entirety of the part where Gandalf and the dwarves fought their way free of the Goblin-king.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir, on the other hand, preferred the tale Bilbo had passed on to Gandalf, of how he had bested the creature Gollum with his riddles.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Which Gandalf did.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Eye-sore and hoping to assuage his curiosity over the brothers' conversation the previous night, the afternoon found Gandalf following the rock-cut steps down to the sheltered side of the castle.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>A bemused Gandalf queried the watching Imrahil, from the shelter of the open-ended tent best positioned to watch the heated battle.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Repeated Gandalf, looking at the chaotic scene again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf asked, unable to hide his amusement.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf let it go; the child was young, and he was still helping.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf mainly kept to the library, appreciating the assistance that Faramir offered him in the early afternoons and evenings, and the occasional late night, but not allowing himself to become reliant upon it again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When he'd had all even he could tolerate of books and scrolls, Gandalf would join Prince Imrahil's warriors and the children at their morning training sessions.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf observed that Faramir applied himself doggedly to his arms lessons, if not with the brilliance and flair he showed when assisting Gandalf with his research.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The youth was so far advanced in his academic lessons, even in mathematics which was apparently his weakest subject, that neither Imrahil nor Adrahil had any objection to Faramir spending the time the other children spent in lessons with their teachers in the library with Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And Faramir certainly seemed to enjoy the time, and having Gandalf's attention.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf found his way down to the beach to watch them several times a week, enjoying the sea breeze and the chaos.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf occasionally noticed Adrahil observing Faramir's not infrequent flouting of the rules involving how high a child of his age was permitted to climb before diving off into the water, but Adrahil rarely called attention to it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf could understand why.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was, rather to Gandalf's surprise, Imrahil with whom young Faramir was the most likely to clash.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That wasn't strictly true, so far as Gandalf knew.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was the first time, in Gandalf's memory, that the boy had called Minas Tirith home, and the word sounded strange coming from his mouth.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was well aware that Imrahil had hammered into each of his children's understanding at an early age that "Just because Daerada is involved, does NOT mean you have adult supervision.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf suspected that was particularly with respect to Faramir and Boromir.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>If they let their nephews get away with just a bit more than they might have otherwise, if they lavished them and the other grandchildren with additional affection and presents above and beyond what they might have otherwise during these summers, well, Gandalf could understand.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He found himself prone to the same sort of indulgence, even towards Boromir, whom Gandalf found exhausting.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>At one point during the summer, Faramir and Gandalf came to another dead end in their research, and Faramir shocked the Wizard by cursing a blue streak.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir saw the shock on Gandalf's face, and clapped both hands over his mouth.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf's first impulse was actually to be impressed as much as appalled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir heard them just fine without Gandalf having to speak them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But Faramir did not always get away with his flouting of the rules, nor would Gandalf have expected him to.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The following day, Faramir scared Gandalf as well as Imrahil by leaping from the high mast of Boromir's ship with Boromir's team's flag.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf could see the boy say "uh-oh," though Faramir was too far away to hear his voice over the sound of the waves.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>With some words of encouragement that Gandalf also couldn't hear, Boromir shoved Faramir towards the shore.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Whatever transpired in the changing house went unheard by Gandalf and the others on the beach.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Imrahil rejoined Gandalf and Adrahil under the shade of the tent.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>His gray-blue eyes went to Gandalf, and then he smiled guilelessly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf grimly suspected that the wily old fox's knees were just fine, but he went, anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf let him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf spoke again, "And everyone pays for them, from time to time.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf pointed out fairly, "And she has two older brothers to fight with, whereas you have the disadvantage of only one."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Imrahil," The old Prince began, after first sending everyone but Gandalf away on one errand or another, "I think that the time has come for you to rule in my stead, as Prince-Regent."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Both he and Gandalf knew of Adrahil's aches from his many years of service, both in the navy and clandestinely.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As he said that, Adrahil winked over his son's shoulder at Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It filled Gandalf with unease.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf asked.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And he invited Gandalf to join him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Only afterward, pouring iced wine and fruit for Gandalf, did he turn the topic to more serious matters.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But Adrahil must have a reason, and a good one, for bringing Gandalf here to tell him this.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>So Gandalf took a deep breath, and asked, "Oh, yes?"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But it would certainly be a desperate measure, and Gandalf said so.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Calm thyself, Adrahil!," Gandalf snapped, putting some of his power behind his words, "You and I, all five of your grandchildren, and thousands of other souls live here, as well, after all!"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Adrahil....." Sighed Gandalf,  his heart aching, understanding why his old friend was torn between jeopardizing their hope for the future by destabilizing Gondor, and saving one beloved child.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sighed again, "I will help if I can, but Elladan is most often not in Imladris.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sighed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf snorted.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Adrahil's contingency plans were much in Gandalf's thoughts over the following days.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was not the type to panic easily, and before Gandalf arrived in Dol Amroth, he had apparently been ready and willing to fake his nephew's death, and send Faramir far away from everyone and everything he'd ever known, so far from his family that he might never see them again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The boy himself showed no sign of being in so much danger, at least not that Gandalf could see.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>On the contrary, he was blossoming in Dol Amroth, under the love and regard of Lorias, Imrahil, Adrahil, and even Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was watching Faramir again on a slightly overcast day, while the children played capture-the-flag.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No one noticed, well, no one but Gandalf and Imrahil, but Erchirion must actually have dropped the flag to Imrahil's youngest children, Amrothos and Lothiriel.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Back on the sand afterward, on the way back up to the castle, Gandalf saw Boromir grab Faramir around the shoulders and muss his brother's hair.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stayed in Dol Amroth for another week after that, attending the dinners and the dances, watching the children at their play and telling them stories as well as continuing his research.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It had been enlightening for Gandalf to see Boromir and Faramir with Imrahil and his family.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There was something about Faramir's tactics that one day, using the discounted Amrothos and Lothiriel to steal the enemy flag, that stuck in Gandalf's mind, although he was not yet sure why.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had hardly known what he was going to say, but the words came to him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf smoked his pipe as he considered that.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf took it as an omen.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf explained, thinking to himself that it would not matter how much knowledge he had accumulated, if he had not also nurtured enough such beings who could wield the knowledge.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The Prince of Dol Amroth offered, not bothering to hide a smile at Gandalf's poorly hidden wince at the idea of sailing with Telemnar again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As Gandalf prepared to sail from Dol Amroth to the port nearest the shire, he saw the two small ships bobbing in the harbor, as Boromir and Elphir led their brave crews in another game of capture-the-flag.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf hoped that they would be ready.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>Gandalf it was that last spoke to Faramir ere he rode east.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘But I can say this: you [Faramir] have an air too, sir, that reminds me of, of—well, of Gandalf, of wizards.’<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Mithrandir among the Elves, Tharkûn to the Dwarves; Olórin I was in my youth in the West that is forgotten, in the South Incánus, in the North Gandalf; to the East I go not.”<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>“Hello, sir,” he said, and Gandalf shook his head, laughing slightly as he did at such a formal gesture from a young person.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You may call me Mithrandir, or Gandalf if that is easier.” Faramir smiled at his words and Gandalf returned his gaze to Finduilas.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Boromir says they are the best, and he said you have a massive dragon one,” Faramir said eagerly, his apprehension at first meeting Gandalf now completely gone.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He had perked up, eyes wide with excitement and Gandalf laughed, marvelling at the wonder that is human children.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I assume Mithrandir is busy?” Finduilas said, aiming her question at Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He turned back around to wave at Gandalf who, despite only just meeting him, liked the child.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Well, two children exactly like Boromir would certainly be a handful,” Gandalf joked, laughing and remembering the last time he had seen the elder son, running around with boundless energy, slaying imaginary orcs and winning battles for Gondor with his wooden sword.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As night was approaching, Gandalf sat in the library, desperate for information he may have missed on previous visits.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Oops,” a small voice uttered, making Gandalf jump slightly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf laughed, thinking that perhaps Finduilas was wrong and her two sons were more similar than she thought.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Many a time in the past, Boromir had snuck off to seek Gandalf out when his parents had wanted him elsewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But in truth I have finished here for tonight, so I will call upon you for help tomorrow.” Gandalf’s heart softened at the look of disappointment in his eyes and came up with an idea.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was not too sure that he was welcome at Minas Tirith.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He had found Boromir earlier on that day, and although he put on a brave face, Gandalf knew he was hurting inside.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf smiled to know that despite his protests, Boromir was still a child at heart and not as grown as some thought him to be.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>After listening to Boromir get upset about his inability to help his younger brother grieve, Gandalf left him alone and sought out the younger of the Steward’s sons, hoping to help him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf saw no tear marks on his face, but it was clear that the child was in a lot of pain emotionally.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>For a while, there was no noise apart from the hustle and bustle of the city below them, but the silence was eventually broken, as Gandalf heard the young boy sniffing, trying to hold back tears but not successfully doing so.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf offered him a handkerchief, which Faramir took gratefully and tried to wipe his eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf did feel somewhat awkward sat beside the five-year-old as he cried, unsure of what to do or say.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>This surprised Gandalf, for Denethor had become a strict and cold man, a man who Gandalf had assumed would be ashamed at his son’s tears.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was not unloving, because he had certainly loved his wife and oldest son, and though Gandalf had come to realise that he did not often show it openly, it was still clear that Denethor loved his second son as well.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was often harsher towards the young boy, wanting to mould him into a soldier despite his young age, and this meant that Gandalf would never have thought that Denethor would tell his son there is no problem with tears.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I wanted her to stay.” Gandalf felt extreme pity for Faramir at those words, for there was no one more important in a person’s life than their mother, and this young boy may not even remember her by the time he reached adulthood.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Did you want her to stay in pain?” Gandalf asked, taking a slightly different approach to comfort and Faramir shook his head at his question, “of course, you didn’t.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And so, as simply as he could, Gandalf explained to him what life after death is like.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf remained in the White City for a month, helping both of the boys with their grief.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Without the love of a mother, Gandalf worried for Faramir, a very young child who needed both attention and affection from an adult and feared that he would receive little of either with Denethor so clearly in mourning himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was clearly close to his mother’s family in Dol Amroth, as was Boromir, and so before he left the White City, Gandalf approached Denethor with a proposition concerning his two sons.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Denethor lost his mind at Gandalf’s idea of sending both the boys to live with their Grandfather, Adrahil, for a few months until the presence of the Lady Finduilas was less felt around the city.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf told Denethor that it would do them both good to spend some time at the sea with their family who they do not see enough of, but he was met with a glare full of hatred and a string of accusations that he was trying to steal his sons from him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The Steward told Gandalf that under no circumstances were Boromir or Faramir leaving his side.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf knew that both boys were in good hands, for it was clear to him that they were loved by their father, even if he did not show it, but he still worried for them, and so he kept his promise to Finduilas and returned to the city time and time again over the years to look out for her sons.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Boromir, now fifteen and seemingly too old for embraces, held back and waited to his brother to let go, but extended an arm to the wizard, and Gandalf saw in his eyes that he was happy to see him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir and I will join you both shortly.” Boromir bowed to his father and then led Gandalf out of the room.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The two spoke of Boromir’s progress in the Army Academy and Gandalf noted the pride in which Boromir spoke of his ability to fight and protect his nation, though all Gandalf could think of was how it was disappointing that such young men spent their lives training for war.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Dinner was a rather quiet affair, and Gandalf observed the dynamic between the family of three.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>His birthday was the happiest that Gandalf had seen him since before Finduilas had passed, and he thrived around Imrahil and his cousins from Dol Amroth.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The gratitude in Faramir’s eyes was something unlike Gandalf had ever seen before, and he threw his arms around his father.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There were definite problems between him and his father, and he doubted that he was the only person who could see that, but what Gandalf could see, was that above anything else, Denethor loved and cherished his second son, and it put his mind at ease.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“At just twenty, he is already the Captain-General, the youngest ever,” Denethor continued his long praise of his eldest son, and Gandalf felt a sense of pride as Boromir’s accomplishments were listed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I know that when I pass on, I am leaving Gondor in good hands.” Denethor once again continued to praise his son, but Gandalf noted that he had not seen Faramir since his arrival, nor had Denethor mentioned him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>To Gandalf’s surprise, however, Faramir was nowhere to be found.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf recognised the noise as a sword cutting through the air and feared the worse, though there was no clash of it hitting another sword.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Moving closer, Gandalf was shocked to see that it was Faramir who was taking his frustrations out on the dummy and the boy was clearly exhausted, for he was barely able to hold his sword upright.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Guilt ran through Gandalf as he realised he had startled him and Faramir lowered his sword as he recognised the man who had sneaked up on him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf watched as his strokes became sloppier, due to tiredness, which seemed to only frustrate him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I can’t!” he shouted, something he had never done in Gandalf’s presence before.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I can’t be weak,” he said in a voice so frail and broken, Gandalf barely heard him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I cannot lift heavy weapons, Gandalf, so I use a bow and arrow.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I do not want to be a warrior.” Gandalf knew that about him, he had known it since he had met him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It hurt Gandalf to know that young men such as the one sat beside him would have to fight a war that should have been ended long ago.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>After a short while, Gandalf felt a weight against him and turned to see that the exhausted Faramir had now succumbed to sleep and had slumped against his shoulder.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Looking at the young man, Gandalf was shocked to see how awful he looked.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“When who improves?” Gandalf asked, confused as to what Boromir was talking about.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I thought he was dead, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was so pale, and there was so much blood.” Gandalf put an arm around Boromir, who had quickly become distressed, and Gandalf was in shock at the story that he had been told, and he immediately worried for Faramir.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That lightened Gandalf’s mood a little, to know that although Faramir had been seriously hurt, he was going to be alright.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf didn’t know how long he had been awake for, but with Faramir lingering between life and death, he doubted Boromir had slept properly since they brought him back.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Reluctantly, Boromir left, and Gandalf headed into the Houses of Healing to see Faramir for himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Peering through the opening in the door, Gandalf spotted the Steward beside his sons’ bed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Not wanting to intrude on a private moment between father and son, Gandalf promptly left the Houses, deciding to visit the young lad when he was awake.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stayed away for most of the day, allowing Boromir and Denethor all the time they needed to speak with Faramir, but he was still eager to see him, having been worried for him during his short stay in the city.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf took a good look at him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf doubted he would have the strength to leave his bed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It looks worse than it is,” he said, following Gandalf’s eyesight.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>For a while they spoke, about the latest book he had read, about how he loved Ithilien, about the things Gandalf had seen on his latest journey, and whatever else came to mind.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was truly happy that Faramir would be fine, even if it would take him a few weeks to recover.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir smiled at Gandalf as he left the room.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was shocked at Denethor’s outburst.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>In many ways, their shorter lifespan was a gift, for living for an eternity was not as pleasing as one may feel, though despite this, it had always seemed unfair to Gandalf that those with the shortest lives died so young to protect the other inhabitants of Middle-Earth.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The glimpses that Gandalf got of him with a sword showed he had become a more than fair swordfighter as well.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir remembered how Gandalf had left without a word when they last met, and in the six years since, he had heard nothing from the wizard, not even the usual letter he received on his birthday.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf chose to keep that from Faramir though, not wanting him to direct his anger towards Denethor.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No forgiveness is needed, my friend.” Faramir smiled at his words, and they embraced, and Gandalf felt a huge sense of relief to know that their relationship wasn’t damaged.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was silent as Adrahil’s body was lowered into the ground.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There was hardly a dry eye around, for the old man was dearly loved, and Gandalf himself felt sorrow, for the Prince was someone whose company he had always enjoyed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was among those who left, and he looked back from a distance as Adrahil was honoured by his two remaining children, and his grandchildren, of which there were six.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I am sorry about your Grandfather,” Gandalf said, sympathetically.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was truly a great man, as is his son, who will make a fine Prince of Dol Amroth.” Boromir nodded his thanks to Gandalf, and taking a good look, Gandalf could tell that the young man felt tremendous grief at the death of his grandfather, a man whom he was close to.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was during these celebrations that Gandalf sought out Faramir, who after a small beverage with Boromir, Erchirion and Elphir, sat alone in his grief, as he ever did.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Refill?” Gandalf said as he approached him with a jug of wine in his hands.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No, thank you,” Faramir replied, and Gandalf took a seat next to him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Well, this person must be very wise,” Gandalf said with a smirk on his face, remembering the conversation he had with a then five-year-old Faramir just after his mother had passed away.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>However much Faramir mirrored Adrahil and Ecthelion though, Gandalf had long thought that he was most like his father Denethor, or at least Denethor of long ago before he changed into the cold man he now was.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had never voiced this opinion to Faramir, fearing that the young man would not understand, and Gandalf had often thought that the reason they clashed so much is because of the similarities between them, that when Denethor looks at Faramir he sees the man he should’ve been himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The two spoke more of what they had been doing since they last saw each other, and Gandalf noted that Faramir seemed most at ease when he was speaking about Ithilien, and of course, his brother, Boromir, whom he was still as close to as he had been when they were children, despite their respective duties meaning they have little time to see each other.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was pale, and still, and trapped in a nightmare full of horrors that Gandalf could scarcely imagine.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It had been a long and testing few days for the people of Minas Tirith, and Gandalf had been by their side to aid them the entire time.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>For the first time for many decades, Gandalf felt somewhat hopeful at the thought of defeating the darkness.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
When Gandalf last parted from the younger son of Denethor, he said it would be some time before he saw him once more, though Gandalf himself never imagined that it would be nearly a decade before he saw his friend, and this was not how he wanted to see him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>One I fear will have to wait,” Gandalf replied, not having the time to explain it here.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Gandalf!” Pippin said as he ran towards him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“A halfling?” He murmured in shock, and Gandalf remembered the dream that Boromir had mentioned that lead him to Rivendell, the dream that had originally belonged to Faramir.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I’ve already met two of them.” At Faramir’s confession, Gandalf nearly dropped his staff, aware of the two halflings he spoke of.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
He returned quicker than Gandalf expected, and he looked far worse off.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Once more, Gandalf wondered what words Denethor had chosen to speak to his son, for the look on Faramir’s face was the one he usually wore when his father had less than kind words for him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When Gandalf had been told of Boromir’s demise, he grieved terribly for the young man, but the grief that his brother held was clearly tearing him apart from the inside, and he had no one to share his grief with.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Not even his father, for the tensions between them had only grown in Gandalf’s absence.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I must return to my chamber.” And with that he was gone, leaving Gandalf’s heart filled with pity.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Imrahil looked dejected at the news, and Gandalf stepped aside to give him time alone with his nephew.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As Aragorn tended to him, Gandalf thought on his parting with Faramir as he had undertaken his father’s mission to retake Osgiliath.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf remained sat down, listening to the passer-byers, and his ears pricked up at this particular conversation.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
At this, Gandalf sprung up and interrupted the conversation, heading towards them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“What you say is true?” The man nodded, and before he could reply, Gandalf had taken off and rushed towards the main gate, hoping it was not too late.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Feeling dejected, Gandalf found a quiet corner, and allowed a small tear to fall from his eye.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“His eyes,” Imrahil said, bringing Gandalf out of his day-dream.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf watched as Faramir’s eyes slowly opened, struggling to adjust to the light.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>After many years of war and darkness, a happy event such as a wedding was something that brought warmth to Gandalf’s heart, especially this wedding in particular, for it meant that Faramir had the biggest smile he had seen on him for a long time.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There was a light in his eyes that Gandalf hadn’t seen since before his mother had passed away, and it was down to Éowyn, whose eyes held a similar light.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked across the room and spotted Faramir, who watched the pair dancing, and headed towards him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Thank you, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You certainly are,” Gandalf jested, making Faramir chuckle slightly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You gave her your mother’s cloak?” Gandalf asked, noting the starry, blue mantle wrapped around Éowyn’s shoulders.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There were toasts to the happy couple, wishing them a long and happy marriage, and Gandalf even heard a few jests aimed at the groom that made Faramir blush.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Confused, Gandalf turned to him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Did he suffer?” Gandalf knew who he was alluding to.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But Gandalf wanted the subject changed, for the day shouldn’t be marred by anything.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“What brings you here, Gandalf?” She asked as she took Elboron back into her arms.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faramir gave his son a kiss, and his wife, before turning to Gandalf, clearly happy to see him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“We were not expecting you Gandalf.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The hopeful look on his face nearly destroyed Gandalf, knowing this was the last visit Faramir would receive from him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They laughed a while, reminiscing of old memories from Faramir’s own childhood, and Gandalf knew that the time was right to tell Faramir that he would be leaving.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I don’t understand.” Gandalf let out a deep sigh, knowing it would be hard for the man in front of him to hear what he was about to say.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The confusion left Faramir’s face as he understood what Gandalf meant.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He looked towards Faramir, letting the young man know that he was one of those people, but it seemed to do little to comfort him, for Gandalf could see the emotion in his eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked at the young man fondly, thinking of the journey he had been on since he had met him over thirty years ago and felt a surge of pride run through him, for years of war and being constantly belittled by his father had not changed him at heart, and he was still the same caring, gentle boy he had met back then, now a man who was so unsure of himself, but Gandalf knew he would be just fine without his guidance.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked at Faramir’s blue eyes, still slightly damp with the start of tears, but they began to change, and light returned to them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I will miss you and your random visits, Gandalf.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They had one last evening of story telling together, and in the morning, Gandalf and Faramir embraced as he left, bidding each other farewell once more, but this time, for the final time, as he headed for the Grey Havens, and a lifetime of peace in Valinor.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And after greeting those they had not seen for many years, Gandalf sat down and listened intently, as Legolas told him all about the life of the young boy he had met several years ago in Minas Tirith.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s staff and his tattered hat rested on the man-sized cot across from Bilbo’s own bundle of straw and blankets.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Just tea, please,” echoed Gandalf’s voice from somewhere around the smial and Bilbo startled a little when it didn’t come from the expected direction of the kitchen.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Nevertheless, when he entered the kitchen a few moments later, a tray laden with food in his hands, Gandalf was already seated as comfortably as he could at the table, eyes twinkling as ever, and if he noticed that Bilbo’s hands shook with something more than mere eagerness and that his cheeks were redder than surprised excitement, he chose not to comment upon it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s visit was short, rather disappointingly so, in Bilbo’s opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Have you finished your book yet?” Gandalf asked at one point and at first, Bilbo only shrugged in lieu of an answer.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“‘And he lived happily ever after, to the end of his days.’” His own smile was only half-hearted, barely more than a self-deprecating smirk, but Gandalf’s eyes crinkled in genuine affection and his tone was gentle, when he said:<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They parted after nightfall, and it was only after Gandalf disappeared behind the road’s turn when Bilbo remembered his unfinished letter.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But wizard’s ways are never straight, meandering instead all over Middle Earth to wherever their wizarding business calls them, and thus it was no wonder that when at last the towers of Dale rose above the horizon in front of Gandalf’s weary eyes, the tenth anniversary of the Battle of Five Armies was long past and people were already making preparations for the eleventh.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf patted the neck of his horse, a tall steed of marvellous endurance; a gift from his loyal friend Thengel of Rohan, and murmured a few words in Sindarin into his mane.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Le suilon, Mithrandir,” the Elven archer bowed her head when she reined in her horse to fall into step alongside Gandalf’s.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I remember you,” Gandalf replied, hiding his smile in his beard.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf, she knew, was familiar with half of her story, and smart enough to easily put together the rest.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And how is Bard enjoying his kingship?” Gandalf chuckled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“And you’re there to remind him not to be over-reverent in the face of royalty?” Gandalf’s eyes twinkled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf barked out a laugh.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Whereas Thranduil likes his bread honeyed on both sides, I can imagine,” Gandalf chuckled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Tauriel left him with vague words about seeing to his accommodation soon after they entered the great city, disappearing into the maze of winding corridors and stairways with familiarity that left Gandalf looking after her with a raised eyebrow.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The King rose from behind his desk, stacked with paperwork, and went around it to clasp Gandalf’s hand in both of his own.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ten years had passed since Gandalf last saw Thorin, and now the wizard carefully kept his face in check as not to betray his surprise at the sight.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Not idly do the great Istari pay visits to mortal kingdoms,” Thorin remarked, and Gandalf couldn’t shake off a feeling that the sarcasm in that statement was missing its aim by a mile.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Though Gandalf was less surprised when he noticed that the window faced West.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>A harbinger of ill news, they call me in many realms, Gandalf remembered.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Despite the light casualness of the question, Thorin seemed to be worried, and Gandalf believed he knew why.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Good,” came the murmured reply, and Gandalf sensed relief there, mixed with disappointment.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Well then–” Thorin began with a businesslike nod of his head, every inch the impassive King again, and Gandalf was having none of it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>From anyone else, Thorin wouldn’t have tolerated such bluntness; and truth to be told, even Gandalf was a little surprised when the King only nodded again, uncharacteristic acceptance in his tone: “We may.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Balin was awaiting him in his designated chambers, already stuffing his pipe, when Gandalf arrived.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Well met, Gandalf!” The King’s advisor greeted him with unpretended enthusiasm.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“A wizard is never late, if that’s what you’re suggesting,” Gandalf grumbled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf hummed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf fished out his own pipe and accepted Balin’s pouch of pipe weed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf huffed out a puff of smoke.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Nothing new under the sun, when it comes to Thorin,” Gandalf scoffed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He handed it to Gandalf, who read it silently, little puffs of smoke from his mouth taking no shape at all.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He knows that Bilbo is alive and well, he writes him every year – but you know, Gandalf, that sometimes the head can’t convince the heart.This–” Balin indicated the fragment of a poem, “–is a Lament.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Dwarves!” Gandalf swore.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“What?” Balin looked from him to Gandalf with alarm that the latter began to understand when the messenger added: “Lín, the midwife, is asking for any healers that can help.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf barely had the time to shed his travel cloak when Fíli barged into the room, half of his ceremonial garb still on from when he sat in Court as the crowned Prince and the Heir apparent, eyes wide with worry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I’m afraid there’s no time to lose.” Her eyes alighted on Tauriel and Gandalf and she grunted in satisfaction.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf nodded and patted young Fíli on the shoulder as he went past him, following the midwife back to the private chamber.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo would have liked this look, Gandalf thought to himself as he surveyed the form of His Royal Highness, Prince of Erebor, sprawled unconscious on the floor.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The poor boy looked close to fainting again when they told him later that without Tauriel’s help, his wife would have bled out, and that it was Gandalf’s spell that brought his newborn daughter back from the brink of death.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was humming under his breath a little tune for the wee baby girl almost lost in the folds of his robe, the peach fuzz on her cheeks black and the slivers of her newborn eyes the deepest blue, already a mirror image of their grandmother.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Then she turned to Gandalf, sharp eyes glinting with curiosity.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Oh, that.” Gandalf tugged the sleeves of his robe a little further down, carefully adjusting his grip on the baby.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Tauriel’s happiness is not in my hands, but you - you saved my child, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s pleased face turned serious.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Anything, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf leaned on his staff and levelled Fíli with a stern gaze.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It means, my Prince,” Gandalf sighed, “that you should never underestimate midwives.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf nodded to himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Balin ordered wine to be brought in and Gandalf emptied his goblet with gratitude.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thorin sat by the window, staring into his goblet, unheeding of the occasional glances his family threw his way, until Gandalf came to sit next to him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Some years ago he would have fought Gandalf, denying the weariness of his spirit, but today he didn’t have the willpower to hide.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s tone gentled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Bilbo misses you,” Gandalf replied exasperatedly, “not your letters.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That it is, O King,” Gandalf confirmed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf must have stolen it and delivered it to Thorin.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf is staying at the Green Dragon tonight,” Thorin explained.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>How dare he!” exclaimed Bilbo, realising a bit too late that his fury might look like an over-reaction to being denied the opportunity to grant Gandalf a proper Hobbit hospitality.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You!” Bilbo sputtered in lieu of a greeting as soon as he spotted Gandalf sitting on a bench in front of the Green Dragon inn, puffing away at his pipe as if enjoying the beautiful evening was his only business in the entire Middle Earth.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Bilbo Baggins!” Gandalf boomed, eyebrows drawing together.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf smiled gently: “I was trying to help you.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That was my business and mine alone–” Bilbo pressed on but Gandalf only shook his head.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf coughed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf hummed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What’s this devilry, Gandalf?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It’s more than a bit of snow in the passes over Misty Mountains during winter,” Gandalf admonished him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf regarded him for a while with a familiar expression that Bilbo came to associate with a cryptic statement soon to be uttered.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Tell me, my friend,” Gandalf asked conversationally, “How does your garden grow?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf closed his eyes for a fraction of a second too long.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf?” came the hesitant question.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo sat down next to Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They had a life-long friendship with Gandalf; a lot passed between them that didn’t need to be said aloud.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf laughed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I know, my dear fellow,” Gandalf replied earnestly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had assured Bilbo that the cough that ailed Thorin wasn’t anything worse than a common cold, caught several weeks prior on one of the last days of their trek through the Misty Mountains.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“A couple of days sweating in bed will finally get it out of his system,” Gandalf advised and right he was, as usual.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You gave me a silver-steel shirt of immeasurable worth, you wrote me sad pining poems  - yeah, Gandalf told me about that, by the way – you kept writing me letters filled with praise that would make a cave troll swoon and you’ve travelled across half of Middle Earth to visit me in my humble hobbit-hole, for what?<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>Gandalf!”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Bilbo,” Gandalf warned.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo turned to look at it, outlined by blazing light as Gandalf came up behind him with his staff aloft.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“My name is Bilbo, and this is Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s staff prodded him in the side, and Bilbo cleared his throat.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo could hear Gandalf chuckling under his breath; he graciously ignored it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“As I said, Gandalf and I have been travelling long and far, and hobbits prefer to have a mid-afternoon tea.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“A pleasure to know you, Hilgë.” Gandalf sat next to Bilbo with a creak and a groan, tucking his long grey beard into his belt to keep it out of the way.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hilgë’s empty eyes closed, her lips trembling, before she looked up at Bilbo and Gandalf again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Why have you not moved on, my child?” Gandalf inquired.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo and Gandalf kept watch by the staff’s light as the shifting silver began at last to fade, dissipating into the air like rain into a river.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Old Farmer Trygstad and his sister were waiting anxiously outside the root cellar, and their eyes widened when Bilbo and Gandalf emerged unharmed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When Gandalf refused, he offered it to Bilbo.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Travelling with Gandalf, who was always getting into some sort of trouble or another, it was little wonder the poor horse’s nerves were fragile, but Myrtle was cut from hardier cloth.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As they rode side-by-side, Gandalf lit his long-stemmed pipe.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You did well today,” Gandalf remarked, watching Bilbo’s smoke-ring float above Myrtle’s shaggy brown head like a crown.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>With unusual tact, Gandalf said nothing, and embarrassment soon replaced Bilbo’s annoyance.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“There is a hostel a few miles ahead in Nuroth called the Hound and Crescent,” Gandalf said, pointedly changing the subject.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf tutted disapprovingly, a puff of smoke emerging with each  tut.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf,” Bilbo said, a tad impatiently, “I am fifty years old.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I only wish you would be more careful,” Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“What my mother would think,” Bilbo finished, and Gandalf cut him a rueful glance.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo and Gandalf attracted many stares as they passed through the main road, and Bilbo suspected that this time it was not Gandalf’s absurd hat that was garnering such attention.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The inn looked disreputable, its bricks chipped and the sign so weathered as to be illegible, but Bilbo made Myrtle comfortable in the stable and followed Gandalf inside.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Good evening, Master Dil,” Gandalf called, and the Man lifted his head, squinting.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Why, well met, Master Wizard!” he exclaimed, coming ‘round the counter to offer Gandalf a creaking bow.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"How does a hobbit come to travel with Master Gandalf?"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Master Baggins's business often brings him my way,” Gandalf said, giving every indication of thoroughly enjoying Bilbo's discomfort.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo shot Gandalf a slight glare before two heaping bowls of stew and brown bread were set before them on the counter.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>By the time he and Gandalf went upstairs to seek their beds, Bilbo was hungry, tired, and very cross.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I thought you might like to wash the dust from your hair,” Gandalf said, making himself comfortable on the straw mattress nearest the window and pulling out a bound book from one of his innumerable pockets.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Where shall you go from here?” Gandalf asked.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I could travel with you for a little distance.” It was not unusual for them to part ways -- Gandalf was in the habit of disappearing to do secretive, wizardly things, though somehow they always managed to find each other on the road again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You will find your rhyme,” Gandalf assured him, drawing Fleetfoot up to keep pace at Myrtle’s side.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It is not something I would sing at a tavern, let alone a proper table.” His poems had steadily grown worse, however kindly Gandalf denied that it was so.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Hmm,” Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Easy, easy,” Gandalf soothed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It fluttered its wings self-importantly before perching itself atop Gandalf’s knobby walking staff.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Good morning,” Gandalf said, and to Bilbo’s amazement, the raven answered him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf untied the pouch and gave it over to Bilbo, who nearly fumbled it in his surprise.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf hemmed and hawed at length before putting the paper on his knee and taking out his pipe.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo looked up at him in astonishment, but Gandalf seemed reluctant to say more.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Give us time to confer.” Gandalf offered the bird a generous chunk of salted venison, which seemed to appease it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“He must be gravely ill,” Gandalf murmured.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yes, thank you,” Gandalf said dryly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He left the wicked wraiths for Gandalf or Saruman, as he had learnt his lesson with Wryn Evar.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Though Gandalf was sincere, Bilbo could see that he was disappointed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Tell her that I thank her for her letter and that I am riding to Erebor in the company of Gandalf the Grey.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf produced Foehammer from who-knew-where to sheath it at his belt, and away they rode.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Though they were met by a guard of wood-elves upon entering, Gandalf declined to visit the Elvenking, citing urgent Istari business.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Oh,” Bilbo sighed, and he heard Gandalf chortle softly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As soon as it touched his finger, the world went grey and blurry at the edges, and Gandalf’s gaze seemed to slide right past him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo handed Myrtle’s reins over to Gandalf; if they wanted to avoid notice, it wouldn’t do to have leather straps floating about in mid-air.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No, no,” Gandalf interrupted, “no need to trouble the Lord of Dale over a humble passerby.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf led them to the far south of the city, closer to the lake, where the shining spires did not shine quite so bright and the faces of the Men were grimmer.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf immediately singled out a pair of rough-looking Men sitting at a table, drinking deep and arguing bitterly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Good evening, friends,” Gandalf called, hobbling on his staff as he approached the table, looking altogether feeble and harmless.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf took a seat, and after a hesitation, Bilbo did the same, wary of being sat on by an oblivious patron.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf affected a grimace of alarm.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Master Athel, who had spoken so derisively about Gandalf’s chances, was more than eager to air his grievances to a new audience.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No market,” Gandalf sighed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf waved over the hassled barmaid and slipped her a generous palmful of coin.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"I had not heard of this jewel," Gandalf prompted.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s eyebrows rose.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo was prepared to think the story nothing more than an alehouse yarn -- it sounded fantastical, and the brothers were well and truly drunk -- but the consternation on Gandalf’s face made him reconsider.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Where did you hear this?” Gandalf asked.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And her legs,” Athel said, and Bilbo and Gandalf barely made it out the tavern door before the first stool went flying.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They took an attic room at the nearest inn, and Bilbo went upstairs while Gandalf arranged for a meal.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was very quiet that evening, and it was not until they were tucking into a hearty supper by the fireplace that he broke his silence.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Doubtless it has been exaggerated in the retelling,” Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf said nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Walkways rose to the ceiling in ever-spiralling terraces, and the fathomless depths of the chasm below kept Bilbo close to Gandalf’s legs, lest he be pushed off a scaffold by an unsuspecting dwarf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The guardsman tasked with bringing them to Lady Dís was unresponsive to Gandalf’s attempts at conversation.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo kept to Gandalf’s other side, but he could not help but stare at the lines of indigo ink on the dwarf’s massive arms and on the crown of his balding head.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“In here,” the dwarf grunted, halting so abruptly that Bilbo ran into Gandalf's legs.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Thank you,” Gandalf said politely, and Bilbo scurried to get himself through before the doors were slammed shut behind them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Welcome to Erebor, Master Baggins,” she said, her voice deep and commanding, “and well met, Master Gandalf.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Well met, my lady,” Gandalf replied, coming forward to take her fingers courteously in his.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“We breakfasted,” Gandalf demurred.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s face was like a thundercloud.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Lady Dís cast a glance over at Gandalf, as if for permission.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It is not the sort of magic you imagine,” Gandalf said, a hint of a laugh in his voice.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You have our discretion,” Gandalf assured her.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked pained.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>” Here she nodded respectfully to Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Having apparently decided that he had let Bilbo struggle along himself long enough, Gandalf interjected himself into the conversation once more.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Of course,” Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s fingers were tapping restlessly over the stone in his staff, his expression contemplative.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I am sure,” Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf would share his thoughts when he chose and no sooner.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was relieved to feel Gandalf’s presence at his back, for it gave him the courage to offer Lady Dís his hand this time, which she took with no hesitation.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s pile of blankets was abandoned already, cushions stacked at one end.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There was a look in the lad’s eyes that reminded Bilbo very much of the awe in the eyes of the little ones who were privileged enough to see Gandalf’s whizzing firecrackers.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There you are, Bilbo.” Gandalf was seated at the table with Lady Dís.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Ach, I was to tell you that Thorin sends his apologies, Master Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf accepted a cup for himself, a knowing glint in his eye.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Have heart,” Gandalf told them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He kept near to Gandalf, dodging burly dwarvish bodies as best he could and clenching his fist to keep his ring securely on his finger.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The unusual sight of a tall Man accompanying the prince and princess resulted in many second glances, but Gandalf was known and highly-regarded enough in Middle-earth to earn no more than a few respectful whispers.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As they reached the relative privacy of the alcove, Gandalf put his hand to his heart and made a cordial bow.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You are not changed at all, Master Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Well!” Gandalf said, sounding pleased.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Master Baggins and I are at your service,” Gandalf said, in careful undertones.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf came forward to bow, but Thráin’s haughty gaze seemed to pass right through him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Forgetting that no one could see him, Bilbo shuffled closer to Gandalf, offended on his behalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He needn’t have worried; Gandalf stepped forward again, planting his staff calmly between the two dwarves.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s pleasant expression did not falter, but Thráin’s children looked horrified.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Master Gandalf has travelled far to visit you.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf remained for a moment, his face impassive, before turning heel gracefully and walking in the opposite direction, down toward the great entrance.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Wait, wait,” Bilbo whispered, tugging as subtly as he could at Gandalf’s robes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf still had not returned, and the fire had gone out.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>In any matter, Gandalf will return to us, surely.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>If only Gandalf were here!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The instant that Bilbo saw Gandalf’s distant figure appear on the field before Erebor’s gates, he abandoned his perch on the bridge wall and darted down the path to meet him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf did not so much as flinch when Bilbo barrelled into his legs.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo took off his ring, and Gandalf’s curious look was taken by alarm.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There is something very wrong with the Arkenstone, Gandalf, very wrong indeed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>oh, Gandalf, I think it was Black Speech.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It could hardly have been expressed  less  coherently, but Gandalf’s response proved that he had gotten the gist of it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Tell me everything,” Gandalf demanded.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf betrayed little as he spoke, even as he described the dreadful argument between the king and his children.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Well,” Gandalf murmured, “this is a very sorry state of affairs.” He hefted up his staff and began to walk.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No,” Gandalf said sharply.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You must look at it for yourself, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Perhaps,” Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>This is Master Baggins.” Gandalf nudged Bilbo’s shins with his staff, prodding him forward.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It is an honour to make your acquaintance, Mistress Eagle.” He tore his eyes away long enough to look to Gandalf for an explanation.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Then again, Gandalf was known to collect an odd assortment of friends.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He and Gandalf made camp in the shelter of the trees.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was a mild enough night that there was no need for a fire, but Gandalf lit a small one nonetheless.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf puffed on his pipe and added another branch to the fire.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I am certain you did,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo sat with Gandalf, stealing a corner of his robes to guard against the cooling wind.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When Gandalf groused at him for wriggling, he finally confessed, in a hushed whisper, “She .<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>A chuckle slipped past the stem of Gandalf’s pipe.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>.” He heard Gandalf chortling to himself, and it took everything he had not to grit his teeth.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo heard Gandalf chuckling again, and he felt his cheeks grow hot.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The rumble of her breath and Gandalf’s humming lulled him into complacency, and he closed his eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo and Gandalf returned to Erebor at dawn's first light, just as the procession left the front gates.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo heard Gandalf’s sharp intake of breath, but it was not until he glimpsed the shock on Frerin’s face that he realized what had been said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s lips were pursed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo presumed that they would go directly to the throne-room, but Gandalf left him in the dressing-room to collect their things.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo packed up Gandalf’s spare cloak and a book or two and saw that everything was put back in its place while he waited.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The door burst open and Bilbo halted his swing not an instant too soon: it was Gandalf, and in his hand was the Arkenstone.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf!” Bilbo gasped.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“We must remove this from the mountain post-haste.” Gandalf stuffed the stone in a handkerchief and thrust it towards Bilbo.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s staff flared.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He passed dozens of dwarves, running at full tilt with their spears and swords outstretched -- it gave him a moment’s concern, but Gandalf had never had difficulty getting himself out of trouble before.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was nowhere to be seen, but the Eagle seemed to know where she meant to go, striking forward with confidence.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Through watery eyes, Bilbo glimpsed Gandalf atop an outcropping, his staff a brilliant light in the growing darkness.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He did not trouble himself to wonder how the wizard had gotten there first -- Gandalf had his ways -- but he was surprised to see that he had Myrtle and Fleetfoot with him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Before Bilbo could so much as draw a breath, Gandalf was there beside them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf plucked the dwarf from Bilbo’s arms, settling him gently on the ground before reaching up to help the hobbit dismount.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo knelt to cushion Thorin’s head on his lap while Gandalf examined him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I will need to bandage his head,” said Bilbo as Gandalf studied the lump on the back of the dwarf’s skull.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Nothing at the moment,” Gandalf returned.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It disappeared into the folds of Gandalf’s robes, and it was a smidge alarming how relieved Bilbo was to have it out of his hands.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf lifted the dwarf onto his back with an ease that belied his whitened hair and stooped shoulders, and Bilbo led the ponies.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As soon as Gandalf settled Thorin down, Bilbo emptied his pack and set to work.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf gave him a disapproving look when he lifted one up to examine it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf produced a spare blanket to warm the shivering dwarf and preserve his modesty.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo frowned after her, starting when Gandalf touched his sleeve.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He took the coat that Gandalf handed him, its fabric stiff but only a tad damp, and put it back on gratefully.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sighed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Probably,” Gandalf agreed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He crouched down to help him along, but Gandalf caught his arm.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“How is your head, Thorin?” Gandalf asked solicitously.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Master Gandalf?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf put out his hand placatingly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“We are,” Gandalf confirmed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You really should not be on your feet with a head wound,” Gandalf said mildly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf's expression spoke clearly enough his opinions on the stubbornness of dwarves.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf merely raised his eyebrows.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“He was enamoured of it,” Gandalf continued levelly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The Arkenstone is a black poison whose nature we do not yet understand, but it has corrupted your king.” Gandalf closed his eyes and shook his head.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No.” Gandalf seemed to regret having to say so.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo lunged forward with a cry, but Gandalf had already caught him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He measured out a generous spoonful of powdered ginger-root and added it to the tea, giving it a good stir before pouring the lot into one of Gandalf’s large mugs and placing it within Thorin’s reach.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf kept watch at the cave’s entrance.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>His meekness, however, had also left him; he argued with Gandalf, half-demanding and half-pleading to return to Erebor.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>While the Arkenstone obviously could be returned to the mountain, Bilbo did not see why Thorin must stay with them, but he trusted Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You will ride with one of us,” Gandalf told Thorin at last in a severe tone that brooked no argument.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf led the way, the ponies trotting amicably along the uneven stones.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The notion sat ill with him, and he hoped that Gandalf might be persuaded to send back some word of Thorin to the princess.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>If he and Gandalf could gain Thorin’s cooperation the situation might be salvaged, but Thorin had no cause to trust them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was uncommonly quiet, his attention fixed inward, though he was often watching the sky.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was conferring with Cirwae a distance away, their voices low, and so Bilbo applied himself to the task of cooking a good supper.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Cirwae left to seek her own dinner while Gandalf came to collect his share.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf finished his own meal and set the empty bowl aside with a contented sigh.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf knotted his fingers in his lap.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Perhaps,” said Gandalf, with a droll look.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>A refusal was on the tip of Bilbo’s tongue, but then Gandalf added, “I believe an examination will clear up several matters for us all.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Reluctantly, the hobbit fetched his satchel while Gandalf placed the Arkenstone down onto the grass.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had to have known too.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf murmured under his breath all the while, words that Bilbo would never be privileged to learn but which rang in his ears with a solemn and ancient weight.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Do you see anything?” Gandalf asked.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He glanced up and realized the true purpose of Gandalf’s request.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf made a soft sound of approval, and the Arkenstone was returned to the depths of his cloak.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“A great deal,” Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Flatterer,” Bilbo chided, and was gratified to hear Gandalf’s fond chuckle.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I can tell you this much, Thorin,” Gandalf said, “and you would be wise to listen.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“The Arkenstone will never be taken back into Erebor,” Gandalf declared.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Give me patience,” Gandalf mumbled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo knew enough of the old and enduring enmity between the dwarves and the elves to recognize that Gandalf could not said something more distasteful to Thorin.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You know I cannot,” Gandalf returned tiredly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He tugged at Gandalf’s sleeve.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf gave him a searching look before leading him to the scant privacy of a nearby copse, Bilbo saw Thorin shift, his face alert, as though he meant to take his chance and flee; the next instant, he deflated visibly as Cirwae touched down next to him by the fire, her steady eye stern.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf settled himself against a tree, taking out his ever-present pipe.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I dislike it as much as either of you,” Gandalf said, “but it is for his safety.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf pursed his lips around the stem of his pipe.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Sent by my lady.” Gandalf frowned a little.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked rather shifty.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was unapologetic.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It is,” Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It is merely a theory,” Gandalf harrumphed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You  do  know something,” he said stoutly, for he had his own suspicions too, looming ever larger as Gandalf’s silence stretched on.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf saw his determination and sighed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf led them south, cleaving through a pass that limned the distant dark shape of the Greenwood’s canopy.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf turned in his saddle to look at them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No harm in that, no,” Gandalf said, “but the battalion you asked her to send after you might constitute ‘harm.’”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf always does what is right, even if he sometimes forgets to be kind about it.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Last night was mostly Gandalf’s doing, so you will have to apply to him.” Myrtle lost her footing in the soft mud of the bank; Bilbo tugged her back onto the path, clicking his tongue when she snorted rudely at him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Is that is why you travel with Gandalf?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf turned to watch her go, frowning.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf is as near as kin to me.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf took me in as a child after my mother and father passed, and I’ve been with him these .<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“He is lately turned fifty,” Gandalf called, startling both of them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf laughed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf yanked hard on Fleetfoot's reins, drawing him abreast.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf leapt from Fleetfoot’s back, but Bilbo sat petrified.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>A plume of orange flame billowed from the creature’s snout -- Gandalf cast a shield to catch it, fire battering against the wall of white light, but Bilbo felt a shadow of scorching heat against his face.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Into the air came an eruption of choking ash as Gandalf deflected another blast.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Perhaps if Gandalf could provide the distraction, Bilbo might be able to dash in and skewer it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He stopped some distance behind Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Bilbo Baggins,” Gandalf growled, “leave this instant.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Their wiles did not account for the tricks of an Istari, however -- Gandalf’s light enveloped both of them, deflecting the flames.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The larger one retreated, but the other held its ground, snarling and screaming at Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf managed to dash the smaller drake against the rocky bank, and it tumbled into the water.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf slowly lowered his staff and watched the horizon with a pinched, troubled brow.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Be quiet,” Gandalf snapped.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf examined her wing, seeming to take her word that she was quite old enough to know her own limits, before moving on to the corpse on the bank.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Nor I,” Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“A curse upon this foul creature's head,” Thorin muttered darkly, and then he looked to Gandalf with steely determination in the jut of his chin.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf whistled, and a small brown starling touched down on his staff.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sent the starling to Erebor with the news after they set the dragon’s body ablaze.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf found them shelter in a hollow under a hillside cliff.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When supper was done, Gandalf stepped away with a rather cryptic remark, promising to return in short order.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Thorin Oakenshield!” Gandalf shouted.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked much as he always did -- the drab, harmless grey wanderer -- but there was such an inferno in his eyes that the steadiest soldier of Men would have quailed before him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No, Gandalf, I’m quite, uh, quite well.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That was foolish indeed,” Gandalf told Thorin, very coldly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was still and stiff and did not say a word even as Gandalf sheathed the dagger in the depths of his own cloak.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Are you sure you are not hurt?” Gandalf asked.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No, I shouldn’t have.” Lord Elrond had said as much when Gandalf first brought him to Rivendell, a stricken lad torn from the only home he had ever known.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf believes the Arkenstone is anchored to one.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There was a sense of unspoken urgency in the way in which Gandalf and Cirwae watched the sky, and Bilbo was no less eager to leave this land behind them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You will ride with me,” Gandalf said sternly, and Thorin offered no objection.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked unsurprised to see them, but Bilbo’s heart sank.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf, we cannot let them do this,” he hissed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Hail, Gandalf the Grey,” said she.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Good morning,” Gandalf returned with an affable smile.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“How very like him,” Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>With luck, we shall bring no dragons to your door.” Gandalf clicked his tongue, and Fleetfoot pressed forward, but Thorin slipped down suddenly from the horse’s back.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo tensed, but Gandalf made no motion to stop him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The stillness was broken by Gandalf’s sigh.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf held Fleetfoot back to keep pace with Myrtle as they ate and passed a waterskin between them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo nibbled at his lip, glancing to Gandalf, who met his questioning eyes with a shrug and a faint, rueful look before returning his attention skyward.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf dismounted at once, calling on the rest of them to stay there while he investigated.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo obeyed for a minute or two (which was more than Gandalf ought to have expected by now) before swinging down after him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Dragonfire,” Gandalf confirmed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thorin drifted away to study the other bodies, but Bilbo held to Gandalf’s side.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They may have passed this place on their way to us.” Gandalf was visibly bewildered, if only for an instant -- it was not an expression often to be found on his face.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf,” Thorin called suddenly, an urgent note in his voice.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo looked around for Gandalf only to find that he had disappeared, along with Cirwae.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“After a few weeks of this, my mother called upon Gandalf for help.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was glad it hadn’t taken long, for he wanted to be ready to leave when Gandalf saw fit to return for them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You will have to ask Gandalf about that when he comes.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But Gandalf did not come -- not that afternoon, nor that evening, and Bilbo began to fret.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When it became clear that Gandalf and Cirwae were not returning, the two of them reluctantly dismounted.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>My parents sent me away with Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf!” Bilbo crawled hastily out of their nest, Thorin at his heels.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Is unharmed,” Gandalf was quick to assure him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“They are,” Gandalf agreed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>.” He dropped into a ferocious burst of Khuzdul that contained some un-princely sentiments, if Gandalf’s look of fleeting amusement was anything to judge by.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s brows rose.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“If it were only so easy to break it, I would,” Gandalf told him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“The library,” Gandalf interjected.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It is,” Gandalf said, “and yet it is the knowledge buried there that she seeks.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Stuff and nonsense, Gandalf, I won’t leave you now!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf thumped his staff in a fit of pique, but Bilbo knew it was done out of worry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf seemed both proud and unhappy, but he squeezed Bilbo’s palms between his own.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s countenance softened a little.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Take only what you can carry on your back and leave the ponies,” Gandalf told them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thorin shouldered their blankets and both of Bilbo’s saddlebags, and Gandalf returned his dagger to him with a stern look.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo wished he could feel the same awe; he could only think of what lay before them, and of the thrice-damned stone hidden in the folds of Gandalf’s robes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>His companions seemed to have no such difficulties -- they slept quietly, Thorin curled on his side and Gandalf propped against the slope of Cirwae’s shoulder, his open eyes (which had long ago ceased to unnerve Bilbo) unfocused.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Or perhaps Lothlórien, if Gandalf meant to stay.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf becomes too mischievous by far if he’s been in one place too long, you know.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf and Thorin were sitting together at Cirwae’s neck.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was narrating some story or another, and when Bilbo’s ear snatched up a few stray phrases, he smiled to himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf gave him a severe look, but Cirwae cackled her strange, rusty laugh.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Preserve me from pert hobbits and insolent dwarves,” Gandalf groused.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But he finished the story nonetheless, describing the fall of the evil sorcerer of Men who had been vanquished by the staves of Saruman and Gandalf, the sword of Elrond, and the powerful magic of the Lady Galadriel.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was prevailed upon to tell a few more tales, and though Bilbo had heard them all before, the familiar rhythm of his storytelling was comforting.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf spoke briefly to assuage Thorin’s concerns -- Moria was in the hands of the orcs, true, but Lady Galadriel had the means to sneak them inside its walls without disturbing its unpleasant inhabitants.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo cleaved to Cirwae, but the haunted pallor that had come over Gandalf’s face frightened him more than the breakneck speed of their descent.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf slid from her back to run to Prince Frerin, but Bilbo knew that the dwarf was dead, for no one could survive such wounds.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stepped away hastily as the prince gathered up his brother’s body, and in a clumsy panic, Thorin began to wrench the arrows from Frerin’s throat one-by-one.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf touched Bilbo’s shoulder.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Though Bilbo and Gandalf scoured the valley desperately for survivors, there were no living souls to be found.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>At length, Gandalf surveyed the field and shook his head.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He followed Gandalf back to the outcropping, feet dragging in the wine-coloured mud.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo and Gandalf stood for a moment, watching somberly -- neither one of them, Bilbo thought, wanted to be the one to interrupt.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked as though he might protest at first, but after another pained glance at Thorin, he conceded, “An hour.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf approached to offer his cloak as a shroud.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I will,” Gandalf said solemnly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo uttered a cry, but Gandalf had already caught him up.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He leaned into Gandalf's side, sniffling as he wiped at his face.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yes,” Gandalf said, with great remorse and disappointment.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s smile was a small, sad thing.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Our pursuers are not far behind us,” Gandalf reminded them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The fire was tamped and they left the cliffside, for Cirwae and Gandalf had gone down into the valley.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo knew that Gandalf had seen to it that his remains would be concealed until they could return.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There was a new urgency in the Eagle’s movements and Gandalf’s sober glances, and all felt the tension.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ahead of them, Gandalf began a conversation with Cirwae about the direction of the wind.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The sun was high overhead when Gandalf declared that the ruins were at last in sight.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>In fascination, Bilbo leaned over as far as he dared and overbalanced, but Gandalf caught his collar unceremoniously.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“The Great Gate is guarded by watchmen,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had wandered over to the bald patch of mountain stone, which stretched only a hand’s-breadth taller than the tip of his hat.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They seemed to come to some sort of agreement; Gandalf tapped the stone with his staff, and Bilbo caught his breath as a scrolling image of two intertwined trees appeared across its surface and softly glowed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“There is no time,” Gandalf interrupted.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The suspicion was confirmed by one particularly ugly orc displaying his prize of a dwarf’s head, and it was only Gandalf’s timely intervention that stopped Thorin from taking his knife to them all in a rage.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“A book, of course,” Gandalf replied.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf and Lady Galadriel combed through the book-stands behind the tables, and the Eagles took to the air to scan the highest shelves with their sensitive eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He hefted the book into his arms and went in search of Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had never actually viewed the book himself, but Galadriel was swiftly fetched.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf recovered himself first.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“We will be safe enough,” Gandalf assured him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was fond of mysteries, and there was very little that could confound a wizard.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf did not always mean to be so secretive, really, but Bilbo had found that sometimes he needed a reminder that not everyone knew everything.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“As you wish,” Gandalf said easily, “but all of this is really your doing, Bilbo.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf, do you mean to say that this dragon Saaum  is  the Arkenstone?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked rather impressed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That is the problem,” Gandalf confessed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf, who had been watching them with gentle amusement, began to frown at this.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Even Lady Galadriel stumbled, catching herself on Gandalf’s arm.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Bilbo,” Gandalf cried, his staff aflame, “take Thorin and hide!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I had not counted Smaug of the Withered Heath a fool,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I am as strong as the day when first we met, Gandalf Greyhame.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s hand twitched on his staff, and the pocket of Bilbo’s weskit bulged with a familiar weight.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>His staff arching in a circle of blue flame, Gandalf leapt forward to fight at his lady’s side as the dragons began to recover from their stupor.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They flew in a dizzying cluster, weaving in and out like snakes, repelled by potent bursts from the Lady’s hands and Gandalf’s staff.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Oh,  where was Gandalf?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There came a billow of flame, and Gandalf’s voice shouted imprecations.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo had done his best to explain it to Gandalf and later to Elrond and his healers, but there were no comparisons to be made, no expressions that could encapsulate a sensation so unnatural.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Terrible images assailed him, scrolling before his mind’s eye: there was Gandalf, drowned in flame as his beard scorched and his skin peeled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf could remove the dragon-sickness, the king could have his sanity restored to him, Thorin could go home, and nobody would have to trouble themselves about fire-breathing ruffians again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Really, the only thing he regretted was that he had not spared the time to tell Gandalf that he loved him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Oh, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf would be furious.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Your Highness, Gandalf isn't a necromancer either.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He wanted to ask him to look after Gandalf and ensure that he would not blame himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf the Grey and Thorin brought you here atop the back of an Eagle, and you’ve been recovering ever since.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf would know if she was truly gone.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As his eyes roamed the figures around his bed, seeking reassurance, he realized for the first time that Gandalf was not there.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Where was Gandalf?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>If King Thráin was able to attend council again, that meant he was recovered, and if he was recovered, Gandalf must have already scoured the dragon-sickness from the mountain.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Once he was settled, he again asked, “Where is Gandalf?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had somehow managed to heal him, most likely at the expense of his own power, and yet still he did not visit.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I thought something dreadful had happened to you, or to Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He and Gandalf had quarreled on occasion, as companions are wont to do, but never once had he imagined that his friend would leave him behind.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“And you think he went with Gandalf?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo winced to hear how distraught Gandalf had been to discover him half-dead at the base of the stairs.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She was not willing to die, and by that determination, Gandalf and Galadriel had enough time to summon their healing incantations.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Their last enemy defeated, Thorin and Gandalf had rushed him to Erebor to watch and wait, while Galadriel collected the pieces of the Arkenstone to bury deep in Lothlórien.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf insisted that you would, but Óin had never seen anyone sleep so long.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo was now aware enough to register aches and pains, as well as worries -- he worried about Gandalf, wherever he was; about the dragons who still lurked in the Withered Heath; about poor Landroval, who would now fly alone; about Thráin, who was lost in his grief; and about Thorin, who now bore the full weight of the crown.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They did not linger on Gandalf’s cleansing of the throne-room either -- the mere mention of his missing friend pained him, and the princess was a clever dwarf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf, I think.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was a faunt, clambering through the overgrown forest at Gandalf’s side.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Even the Lady Galadriel could not be contacted for information, for Lord Celeborn’s brief, polite reply had stated simply that Gandalf had not passed the borders of Lothlórien for many months.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Why would Gandalf not come?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Reluctantly, he gave up his morning vigil -- Gandalf would not travel in through the deep snows anyway, and everyone grew fussy when they thought he was liable to catch a chill.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stood at the door, his hat askew and his silver beard dreadfully windswept, and Bilbo had never been so happy to see anyone in all his life.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>In three strides, Gandalf was before him with arms opened wide; every last drop of Bilbo’s resentment and worry flew from his head as he lunged to meet him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Here and there.” Gandalf drew back enough to take Bilbo’s face into his hands.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It took some time before Bilbo felt himself equal to pulling away, and he kept a hand anchored to Gandalf’s sleeve lest he disappear again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf swept off his hat to bend his head to her respectfully.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You continue to work marvels, my dear,” Gandalf said, and with a little laugh she ushered Kíli and Ori away.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf remarked on the cleverness of the chair and pressed Bilbo about how he had been treated in the mountain, seeming pleased by what he heard.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Angry?” Gandalf repeated incredulously, as though the idea were the greatest absurdity he had ever heard.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf pulled up a chair beside him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He would forgive Gandalf, he knew -- he always did.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yes,” Gandalf said, and left it at that.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I should say, you  and  Gimli.” Gandalf paused then, and his eyes flitted from Bilbo’s face to their joined hands to his blanket-covered legs.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf did not refute him, or insist that he was mistaken.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That is a story that requires a smoke,” Gandalf said, industriously packing his bowl.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>While Gandalf’s return had been met with pleasure in most quarters, Gimli’s mother and father were understandably upset.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>To stop Glóin from doing something foolish, Thorin arranged a council to mediate the dispute, and before the king and his most trusted advisers, Gandalf and Gimli told the entirety of their harrowing tale.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There were magic objects enough in Middle-earth that a ring of invisibility had given Gandalf no concern.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had waited as long as he dared for Bilbo to wake, but at length the fear of the Ring finding a new master had forced his hand.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Choosing Gimli as the Bearer had been partly convenience, for he had been in the rotation guarding Bilbo’s door and thus had made himself familiar to Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>(“Oh, this and that,” Gandalf said, waving a dismissive hand.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Their progress was slowed by a handful of dragons that yet lingered after Smaug’s defeat, and Gandalf had incurred severe injuries during their flight from Moria.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Landroval flew directly to Lord Elrond and his healers, but even with the magic of the elves, it had taken nearly a month for Gandalf to leave his bed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When all wounds had been healed, the party returned to the East -- Galadriel to Lothlórien, Gandalf and Gimli to Erebor, and Landroval to the High Cliffs.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“We are fortunate that the Ring was discovered now,” Gandalf concluded gravely.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf said there was not as much of a risk to hobbits, but surely having something so wicked so close to him would have had an effect on him eventually.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf smiled at him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Of course,” Gandalf said, sounding amused, and Master Glóin nodded grudgingly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf settled into his guest quarters and Gimli returned to his post, and the business was resolved to everyone’s satisfaction, or almost everyone’s.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was perturbed to hear that Thráin was still in seclusion, and he went alone one morning to see if he could coax the dwarf from his rooms.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Did you see him?” Dís demanded, but Gandalf would only shake his head, and Bilbo could see that he was grieved.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>A fortnight after the wizard’s return, he asked Gandalf to come to him and told him that he wished to leave before the heaviest snows of deep winter made passage impossible.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf betrayed no surprise at his request.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But I don't need my legs to continue my work, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You sound so much like Belladonna, it is almost as if she stands before me.” Gandalf leaned forward to extinguish his pipe and point its stem at Bilbo's chest.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf said nothing, but the look in his eyes was gentle and sad.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The wheeled chair would be left behind, of course, as it was far too unwieldy to transport over long distances, but Gandalf assured him that they would find a suitable alternative in Lothlórien.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>"Gandalf!"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Gandalf, it's beautiful!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Gandalf?"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"I wouldn't doubt it," Gandalf murmured.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was lost for a moment, squashed between two men in deep blue cloaks, but Bilbo struck off in the opposite direction at once and Frodo made to follow him.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>Bifur looked up at the friend of Gandalf's, who had joined their company just a moment ago and who now was watching him with curiosity.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>Not Mithrandir, not Gandalf the White.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>Ori would occasionally shout, and Bilbo would follow with a hearty "Gandalf!"<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>He glanced back to ensure Boromir and Gandalf still had similar holds on their respective charges; Merry and Frodo.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gimli grumbled something to Gandalf, probably taking offense to the comment on Aragorn's behalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Both he and Gandalf dared to call a somewhat hushed, “Yes!” after their friend's retreating back.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Children,” Gandalf warned half-heartily from where he seemed to be ensuring the hobbits didn’t drown Boromir in the warm water.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“You are as bad as the hobbits, Thranduilion.” Gandalf scolded, even more, half-heartedly thank before.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>If that wasn’t enough proof, Gandalf snorting a laugh into his beard at the Legolas’ words was.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“What he does not mention is that moved an underling out the way of a falling, burning tree, and got willingly strapped beneath it in his place,” Gandalf added, giving Legolas a look Aragorn had no hope of understanding the meaning behind.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf, apparently deeming that answer unworthy offered one of his own, “You are not the only one who was raised with evil breathing on your doorstep, Boromir of Gondor.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>Gandalf was not overly surprised when he and Bilbo were approached by a host of Woodland elves, all heavily armed and looking less than pleased with him in particular.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf did not think in his living memory there was a society more loving and loyal to their rulers than the woodelves were to Thranduil and Legolas and Thranduil was obviously not pleased with him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was good at concealing himself and his feelings, but he did not feel quite as imposing as usual, though he was clearly just as angry as Gandalf had expected him to be.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>In fact, Gandalf was having trouble sensing anything from the elf at all.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>For a moment, Gandalf faltered.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf nearly got a chill form the ice in his voice, and found it quite evenness more unnerving than his father's tempter had ever been, "Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was no fool, he knew when he was being set up, he just did not quite understand how, "I am glad to see everyone well that is well, and I hope that everyone who is not will soon be."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf blinked in surprise, Legolas insisted almost, as a rule, to never be addressed by his formal titles.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Usually, Gandalf would assume such a question was asked to make a point about something, but the sincerity in Legolas's voice startled him further, "I hold no lives above others, Legolas, you know this."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>His bow and twin knives were still strung across his back, and Gandalf found himself wishing that they weren't.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Finally, the young elf broke eye contact to gaze behind the wizard at something that was happening outside of the tent, leaving Gandalf feeling somewhat like a scolded child.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf felt ashamed, he knew his reasons for this quest.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thranduil was good with grudges, to begin with, and Gandalf knew what happened to those who upset his Greenleaf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The effect was that Gandalf was nearly certain he had swallowed boulders and not stones, for how deep his stomach had sunk.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The Prince made to storm from the tent, slamming his shoulder into the Gandalf's as he went, yet he paused in the doorway, "Oh, and Mithrandir?"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Although, he was fairly certain he would have been just as calm and collected as usual had he not been in the company of Gandalf, who appeared ready turn and sprint back into the wilds behind them regardless of the massive pack of orcs who had been following them for many days.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf nearly blanched next to him, and a grimace took up residence on his face, “Yes, although I would not refer to it as such once we enter it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>All of that information, coupled with Gandalfs nearly palpable anxiety, nearly had him ready to run to the Orcs himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf shook his head, “No, it is only dumb luck that has allowed us to keep out of there reach this long.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As if sensing his thought Gandalf muttered beside him, “It’s the trees.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf looked around them warily, “You have heard the tales of Fangorn?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf let out a string of curses next to him and dispelled the goo, “Are you scared of spiders, Aragorn?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf drew his sword, and Aragorn quickly followed, trying to figure out how he was going to fight whatever was coming while still keeping Gollum from escaping in such a tight space littered with roots and holes to trip in.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
When it became apparent none of the elves would speak to them, Gandalf broke the tense silence, “Avaleania, you have my deepest gratitude for the assistance.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Aragorn cut his eyes over the wizard in panic from where he was still sprawled in a heap on the ground where he had fallen, Gandalf had never mentioned that he was not welcome here.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf did not reply, but his expression was telling enough.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gollum had been taken away from them and whisked away to some unknown location under the mountain, and Gandalf found himself glad that at the very least the creature was no longer his problem.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“I 

sincerely

 hope not.” If he was, things were about to go very badly for Gandalf, he had never known Legolas to make an empty threat.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
The elf came to a stop before the pair of them, eyes focused entirely on Gandalf and ignoring Aragorn entirely, which he knew the man was more than okay with.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Although, if Thranduil truly had perished that night Gandalf assumed that Legolas would have already gone up one side of him and down the other, perhaps even resorting to a few blows, which meant that the King still lived.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf pursed his lips for a moment, unsure exactly what to say.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thankfully, he was not wearing his weapons this time, although Gandalf strongly suspected he had several knives hidden on his person somewhere, and could use them with the same deadly accuracy.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf cast a desperate looked at Aragorn, who still stood silently near him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Legolas had stopped himself from continuing and stormed towards the wizard so fast and with such purpose Gandalf had to fight the urge to take a step back, “Who knows you have brought him here?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf had no answer to give him, somehow Thranduil always seemed to have information he should not have, and he yet to figure out how he accomplished it for someone who had no contact with the outside world.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
After so much time spent travelling with Gandalf, he knew that it was not entirely uncommon for people or cities to have a distaste for him, the wizard was an acquired taste to say the least.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Aragorn could have sworn Legolas hid a smrik in another bite of the apple, while Gandalf drew himself up, “Thranduil-”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf looked like he was ready to scream, and then the older elf replied, “I hope you do not plan on making a habit of routinely bringing such distasteful creatures to my home every few decades.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf plowed on, ignoring Legolas’ comment entirely, “To keep him hidden here, in your dungeons where he cannot cause harm and cannot be found.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
The younger elf made to herd them forcefully from the room, but Gandalf, having realized he lost this particular match surrendered, “The Shire.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Never before had Aragorn been ushered out of a room so swiftly, but just as the door was about to slam itself shut once more Gandalf wedged his foot in the door, “Will you ever forgive me, Greenleaf?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They had been allowed to spend three days to rest, another courtesy Gandalf knew was only for Aragorn's benefit, but neither man nor wizard was keen on spending any more time in Mirkwood than they had to.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf was silent for a few more long moments, “Do not judge him so harshly upon this meeting.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf's voice was much softer than he had meant it to be, and he winced at the crack in it when he replied, “Yes.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf had to admit he was glad that moments after his arrival, the twins had whisked Legolas off into the wilderness for an additional week before returning him once more.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
It was also the first time he had seen him completely unarmed, and so Gandalf found himself cautiously agreeing.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“And I hope you never do.” Legolas paused in thought, and Gandalf considered this a good sign, true to Oropher’s line the only time his tongue got away from him was when he was angry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf was reminded of how volatilely Gollum reacted whenever he touched or even saw something that was obviously touched with Elvish light, he did not wish to ponder what pain darkness pierced into the immortal bodies would feel like.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf was reminded of one particularly dark part of Bilbo’s tale in Mirkwood when he was forced to use his tiny blade.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Unlike that night in the tent Legolas was restless, his hands were clasped together but Gandalf could still see where he tapped rhythms softly into his hands with his fingers, “What happened to Thranduil?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Legolas shook his head softly, and broke eye contact for the first time since Gandalf had entered the room and it was only to blink tears from his eyes, “I don’t know, I tried not to but I lost him in the battle, everything was so hectic.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
The young elf sighed and wiped one of his eyes, Gandalf pretended not to notice, “I did not intend to say everything I did that night, when I called for you.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf wished to say he was surprised, but he was not.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf and Elrond often discussed how thankful he had never taught Legolas, even if it pained the young prince.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
A long silence stretched out between them, Legolas seemed to be satisfied with giving Gandalf the opportunity to excuse himself and leave if he wanted for the prince had said his peace.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
But he did not wish for his only good conversation with the Prince in the last century to be over just yet, so Gandalf settled for what he hoped would be an innocent enough question to not get himself in trouble, “How did you know it was Aragorn that day?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf couldn’t help but give a surprised and delighted laugh, endlessly pleased with both the twins display of fierce loyalty and love, and the ability to keep such a secret from their father, “Truly?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf hadn’t been sure if he should come, regardless of the fact he had been invited by Legolas himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She had claimed it was to check on her son's wellbeing, but Gandalf still had the distinct impression that she just wanted to watch whatever happened when Thranduil finally got ahold of him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The elf had not yet been healed and strong enough to bother hunting him down the years before Gandalf had sailed west, now however, he was very much alive and well.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Much do Gandalf’s immense relief, the other two times he had seen Thranduil on this side of the ocean he had been with his beloved wife, and had been too caught up with her to do anything except give him a cold stare.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Surprisingly, the king was not even upset with Gandalf on his own behalf, for the great wound and suffering that plagued his last years in Middle Earth.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf arrived to the celebration nearing midnight as the hastily scrawled invitation had asked.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf glared at them openly, while the two elves merely laughed off his disgust easily.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
The sight in found in the clearing was far more beautiful than anything Gandalf had seen on his walk through these enchanted tree’s.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Eyes only for each other, and a smile was painted on Thranduil's face the likes of which Gandalf had not seen him wear in a millenia.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
There was also something about the ElvenKing that Gandalf had not seen in quite some time, peace and calmness.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Near him Celebrain sniffed, and wiped at her eyes, clearing seeing everything Gandalf was and probably more.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Carefully Legolas climbed atop of the highest table that he could and held up his hands for silence, which descended so swiftly and effectively Gandalf might have thought it a spell, “And now, the moment we have all been waiting so many years for!”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Swiftly he brought the cane down on his knee, snapping it effectively in half, and Gandalf winced at the strength he must have used to accomplish that.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>After several moment he set his son back on the ground, placed both hands on his face and said one of the most sincere, ‘Thanks yous’ Gandalf had ever seen.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Somebody shouted a toast that Gandalf didn't quite catch, but he raised a glass along with the other anyways.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
As the others took a drink, both Legolas and his father gave a long-distance ‘cheers’ in Gandalf's direction before taking a drink.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>But Lith did not wish to risk disturbing the Ranger, and besides, he knew that he could not leave again without at least bidding Gandalf and Bilbo goodbye first.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
'Gandalf was right then, it seems, as usual,' the man said, adjusting the supports.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gimli, this is Lith, who used to go about with Gandalf and visited me in Hobbiton every now and again.’<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
‘Gandalf told me you had gone off again, after the Council,’ the old hobbit chattered on, seeming oblivious to Lith’s discomfort or the Dwarf’s irritation.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘Gandalf probably knows.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
‘When the ring travels south,’ Gimli said to Aragorn, ‘I shall go with you and Gandalf, and my axe shall clear your way.'<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Or perhaps since he had met Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘Gandalf believes that is my doing,’ Aragorn said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>In the meantime, I will do all that I can with Gandalf to prepare the Ringbearer for his journey and for the trials to come, and we must hope that it will prove enough.’<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There was much to do, and Aragorn spent many hours in consultation with Glorfindel and Gandalf, and then later also with Boromir, who had endured long years in strife against the forces of Mordor in Ithilien and Osgiliath, and had many observations to impart on the strength and tactics of the enemy.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf took over the task of sitting with the Elf until he awoke from the trance, and so Aragorn finally found himself free to seek out Arwen.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘Gandalf, I hope.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>All heads turned to look, and Aragorn saw Gandalf entering the dining hall, and with one hand he was steering Lith along by the shoulder.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf prompted Lith into an empty seat near to the hobbits and then sat himself down on the other side.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Lith had his head bowed, but Gandalf looked around the room slowly and firmly, as if challenging any other to object.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn noticed the way Gandalf had to nudge Lith every so often to remind the disoriented Elf to eat.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He rose with an angry gesture and said something Aragorn could not hear towards Lith and Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf muttered something under his breath and picked up his goblet.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn escorted Arwen, as much as one could on crutches, into the Hall to her usual dais to hear the evening song, and Gandalf came in not long after with the hobbits.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>After the first song came to an end—a long lay telling of the Battle of Fornost—Aragorn gave Arwen a chaste kiss and moved over towards where Gandalf sat with the hobbits at his feet.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>On seeing Aragorn approach, Gandalf excused himself and the pair retired to an unobtrusive corner.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘Fear is one thing,’ Gandalf said, shortly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘He will not fall out of a tree if that is what you are worried about,’ Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sighed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘Gandalf,’ he said, softly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf did not seem to have expected the question, and he considered for a long time before he answered.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Again the healing took several hours, and after the surgery was complete, Aragorn left Lith to Gandalf’s care once more, sure that his friend would have no wish for more of Aragorn’s troublesome company this day.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘This is the Elf Gandalf wanted us to look out for,’ Frodo said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘Besides, if you’re already friends with Gandalf, Strider  and Bilbo, Lith, then I don’t think you really stood a chance of shaking us off!’<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘I have known Gandalf and Bilbo a long time.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘It is like to Gandalf’s name, then,’ said Lith.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘I can’t wait to tell Gandalf my name is a better version of his.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The Elves here all seem frightfully busy and important all the time; rather like Gandalf in a bad mood.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He may be known to you, Gandalf, but I trust him not.’<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I don’t think we have any canon support for the use of a similarly complex naming structure amongst the Sindar/Silvans but Legolas himself is called Greenleaf by Gandalf and Galadriel as if it was an epessë, so I am taking that to mean the practice is at least somewhat reflected in those cultures, if not so widespread.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Will Gandalf's warning put him off from this mystery?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn and Arwen go to Gandalf with their discovery, but find they are not the first to know it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
When Arwen and Aragorn found Gandalf, the wizard was seated on a balcony off his reading room studying a leather-bound tome and a roll of maps.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘Gandalf—we know who he is.’<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
‘You know who he 

was

,’ Gandalf corrected at once, but he did not seem surprised at all.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Then there were other clues: Lith’s mixed Silvan and Sindar heritage, his woodcraft skills, and the fact that Lith had been cast out at least 60 years ago, perhaps a decade before Gandalf had found him in Fangorn.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf said nothing to that.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf let out a long, slow stream of smoke.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
‘Now you 

know,

 Lady of Rivendell,’ said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf nodded.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf sighed, and his face grew shadowed as if a gloaming cloud had veiled a bright star.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
‘He 

was

,’ Gandalf reminded him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
‘For answers to those questions you would have to ask Lith,’ Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
‘No,’ said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They had agreed between them that they would do as Gandalf asked and would say nothing to Lith of what they had learned, but Arwen had still been determined nonetheless to meet the Elf properly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
‘Bilbo, you met Lith before he came to Hobbiton with Gandalf, did you not?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They let him out after a week or so and I didn’t see him afterwards ‘till Gandalf brought him to Bag End.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Of course, old Gandalf never says anything, but I think there must have been something that Lith got the blame for, some accident.'<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Lith still kept to himself, although over the next few days he gradually began to be seen more and more often around the house, walking with Gandalf or with the hobbits, or sitting near to Aragorn as he worked.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Aragorn was pleased by the improvement in both Lith's bodily health and of his slow acclimatisation to the valley, for both Aragorn and Gandalf were both much occupied of late with preparations for their forthcoming labours and did not have much time to spare for any of their friends.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Go to Gandalf’s rooms; stay out of sight.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Together they hurried to the oldest part of the house where Elrond and his family resided, for here also were Gandalf’s rooms, and there they hoped to find Lith, if he was not already fled from the Valley.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘For one thing, you have not said goodbye to Gandalf, or Bilbo and the hobbits.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But before Lith could reply there was a sound of footsteps outside and the door to the study opened again, admitting Gandalf in a swirl of grey robes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Lith turned to Gandalf with a look of distress on his face and began to talk urgently in his own lilting tongue.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
‘If Lith is proposing to leave the Valley,’ he interjected, ‘then Gandalf, you must tell him this is not necessary; he will not listen to us.’<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
‘That is because you do not understand!’ Lith burst out, but Gandalf was shaking his head.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf himself had warned them against doing so.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
‘I did not tell them,’ Gandalf said, gravely.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf said nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
‘Regardless of whether it is better to leave or otherwise,‘ said Gandalf at last, softly, ‘I do not think there is anywhere 

to 

go, Lith, not now.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
‘I do not know,’ said Gandalf, and he looked troubled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
‘Do not trouble the seneschal, my lady,’ said Gandalf, smiling benignly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But the wizard would not let Lith hide for long, and the morning of the day after, Gandalf insisted that Lith accompany him to the library.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘And Gandalf too.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Lith would have gone right away if he had not told Gandalf he would assist with Bilbo’s work here, if he could.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What about Gandalf, what did he say about it all?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was right, it seemed, when he spoke of the shadow that closed in around Imladris.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
'What says Gandalf?'<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Lith, of course, was absent from the meal, having taken himself off into the trees some hours ago, though many of the others were present: Gandalf seated between Elrond and Glorfindel, Arwen tonight at her father’s right side with his other advisors, and the five hobbits close at hand.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Nearby, Gandalf and Glorfindel were talking low together, their faces grave and calm, but the wizard’s anger was still like a thunderhead even so many days after Lith had been attacked.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had broken off his conversation with Glorfindel and both were watching Aragorn closely.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf, seeming to know the direction of Aragorn’s ire, raised an eyebrow, a gesture that sang of exasperation and suppressed anger and discontent.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It seemed Lith had also managed to persuade Gandalf not to act on his behalf against the Silvans, and the wizard liked it no more than had Aragorn.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
‘No,’ said Gandalf, still frowning but there was a twinkle in his eye that belied the stern look.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
‘Bilbo,’ Gandalf countered, ‘would insist on learning it himself and then writing a treatise on the etymology.’<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They had greeted him with welcome as they sat upon the bench, but Lith had been about to leave them to their rare peace all the same, and go out into the night-time forest, when Gandalf had arrived, quite suddenly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
‘Gimli said that Gandalf is your old dad,’ Merry said, conversationally.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
‘Imagine having old Gandalf as your dad,’ said Pippin then to Merry, wrinkling his nose again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I’ve always been one for stories and tales, particularly about Elves, you see, and he told me lots about you, and Gandalf too.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But there won’t be much time for sightseeing I shouldn’t think, not with old Gandalf in charge.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>'Has Aragorn not told you, nor Gandalf?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
‘Gandalf and all the others say that won’t do,’ said Sam.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>No, Gandalf is coming with us, at least, and Elrond said he would find some other companions for us from among those warriors that reside here.’<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Also Gandalf goes through a lot in this chapter, and he is very tricky to write.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Lith was in Gandalf’s study when Aragorn found him, lying on his belly on the floor.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf is content to lead him and says he will not let his love for you come between them, but while there is still doubt in my mind I do not know how to put it aside.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I know you, Lith; I know what Gandalf and Elrond say of you.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He had sought out Boromir rather than any of those he would normally have confided inㅡArwen, Elrond, Gandalfㅡ specifically because he  could not  speak of it, unable to share the full horror of the secrets he had learned for the sake of his friend's privacy and peace of mind.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But although Lith seemed to have recovered his senses, Gandalf's report the following day was no less concerning.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>At last, in desperation, Gandalf sent for Aragorn, and as soon as the messenger reached him, Aragorn went straight away to the wizard’s rooms, quite uncertain of what he might find there.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When he arrived, Gandalf was sitting on the steps which led to up to his study, deep in thought.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘And?’ said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘Ah,’ said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>'I cannot say the burden of what I learned is not heavy, Gandalf,’ Aragorn said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf nodded, slow and sad.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf said nothing in response to that, only clasped Aragorn’s hands in silent grief and gratitude.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf has left out some of his maps of the Blue Mountains for me to see; they are most interesting.'<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn tried to nod back reassuringly, as he had with Gandalf, though he was feeling more uneasy by the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>asked Gandalf<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘But who then will you send with the Ringbearer?’ Gandalf asked.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf clearly agreed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘Did he now?’ said Gandalf, eyebrows raised.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘And you would consider him now?’ said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘Lith has been much maligned in his short life,’ Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘Everything Gandalf says is true,’ he said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘Well, Lith may be no Eldar prince of the ancient West,' said Gandalf, 'but he has skills with blade and crossbow.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf harrumphed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf; Lith cares too little for his own life.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘Then give him something to live for,’ argued Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was also looking similarly unimpressed, but Elrond had already moved on.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘It might,’ Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>'The hobbits have developed a great affection for Lith as I knew they would,' Gandalf said, and then paused.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘Lith has many skills and bears the bravest of hearts.’ Gandalf said, heavily.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sighed, but he did not dispute the statement.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Now the warriors in the party—himself, Boromir, Gimli, Luinmeord and Gandalf—would barely outnumber the hobbits, and that was a poor balance to take into the Wild.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
‘He claims Gandalf is his father,’ Gimli said, shortly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
‘I’ll ask Gandalf,’ said Pippin, decisively.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As usual, they would have to put faith in Gandalf’s instincts which, when it came to hobbits, were seldom unsound.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I shall speak also with Elrond and Gandalf, and if they are of the same mind as I, then tomorrow 

he 

shall make the choice for all.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘Unfortunately Glorfindel may not go, for like all who have dwelt in the Blessed Realm he walks both in the worlds of the seen and the unseen, and by that very power he would draw the eye of the enemy to us all the more, particularly as Gandalf already walks with us.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf wouldn't have a son who’d killed someone.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>'Cannot Elrond or Gandalf decide?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘It is the intention of Gandalf that we leave Rivendell one week from now, and there is much to do.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Elrond brought Frodo to his study, where Gandalf and Aragorn were already closeted in conference.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
‘And Lith?’ said Gandalf, leaning in.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘Lith is...different,’ he said with a glance towards Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When we talked before of Merry and Pippin, Gandalf, you said it was right to trust to friendship, and I do.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>In those days, Aragorn and Gandalf were often closeted in counsel, or were seen studying maps and books of history and lore, while Boromir and Gimli talked of strategies and battles, and wrote many letters.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>At the bottom of the page in a fourth hand, one Lith knew very well indeed, was a single elf-rune of the letter G: the mark and sign of Gandalf.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>‘He moves as if the darkness were after him.’ Gandalf is no fool.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf have you seen-” The wizard knows his question and answers by simply pointing to a figure pressed against a gray wall.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Do you know what they are about?” Gandalf’s gray eyes became clouded.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf soon left after that night for the banished riders.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>How are you feeling this morning?” Gandalf approaches in silence as the elf mutters an elfish phrase of healing while applying a mixture of herbs to an impaled shoulder of a teenaged child.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Just… distracted.” Gandalf cannot help but observe the young elf’s change in appearance since his frighten sprint through the darkened streets of Rohan.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Depends if you will eat and rest first, young prince.” Gandalf goes to his stunning white horse and pats while he speaks.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I will be fine.”   Gandalf admires the stubbornness of Elves with a small smile.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Will that be an issue?” Gandalf turns to the elf and as Eomer, Aragorn and Gimli enter the stables.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I’m sure he would let us know if he does.” Gandalf assures with a nod and narrowing eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf and Eomer keep watch around their camp while Legolas retreats to the trees.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“ Gandalf says with a slight smile.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Young… Master…Gandalf…” The Ent saw as he spoke the very elf he thought of surveying the land and the tower with widened eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf notices as well but speaks with Treebeard for the protection of Saruman who steps on to the ledge and stares at the young elf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The wizard cannot help but smugly call out to Gandalf and smile when he knows it is information his old friend seeks.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But the great eye has seen it.” Legolas… Gandalf listens to the words as his thoughts soar.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Tell me what words of comfort did you give the halfing before you sent him to his doom.” Gandalf’s eyes pull down in shame.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Stick an arrow in his gob!” Legolas pulls back on the string but Gandalf cannot let him release it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He turns to Gandalf to make him a deal as a knife is plunged in his back.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf kneels on the side of Aragorn but the future king of Gondor is no longer focused on the others for the elf cradled in his arms begins to squirm and his eyes begin to flutter open.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf feels the anger that has been building in him spill over as the smug laughs grows louder.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn speaks as Gandalf stands, though terrified( on the inside), and speaks.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf takes the stone of Saruman from Pippin and they mount the King of Horses<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf can see sleep drift into Pippin.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf too curses mentally for not seeing beforehand.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It is time we stopped before Legolas freezes and the hobbits fall.” Gandalf stops his horse and shakes Pippin awake as the others turn to heed his words.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf takes Legolas in his arms for a moment as the man whose arms stretched to still have a grip on the elf handed him over.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Eomer, start a fire.”  When the man is off his horse he soon takes the elf back but in that moment Gandalf the White had enough of a memory return from his Gandalf the Gray time to open the flood gates and let his past times in Greenwood and Mirkwood come to his mind once more.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn carries Legolas by the bend in his knees and his slender waist over to the spot closest to the small fire where Gandalf has laid down his old gray cloak.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf swallows the guilt inside of him for the new remembered memories bring back old problems, old pains.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s mind thought of a young princling and Aragorn’s mind thought of Legolas.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf, why did Treebeard call Legolas ‘prince of Greenwood and last good of Greenwood’?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It is known that Sauron’s minions still attack those living within the forests.” Gandalf sits forward to face the hobbit as he speaks.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf thought grimly as the hobbits and the wizard move closer to each other.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Second to hold him next to his father, King Thranduil, mind you.” Gandalf says with a smile.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Perhaps you may learn something.” Gandalf snapped back, smiling.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As Gandalf tells the story, well parts of the story, it plays through his mind.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>King Thranduil” As Gandalf speaks Legolas stirs again and Aragorn moves his hand to run through the golden hair.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The queen quickly took rest after that and Thranduil” The elf again stirs and Gandalf carries on.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Did he cry?” Pippin asks when Gandalf pauses to let a smile set upon his time-worn face.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sits staring into the fire as he thought of another time he saw the elf whose head lay on the future king of Gondor’s lap with his blue eyes closed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Ah Gandalf, what brings you to Mirkwood?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Gandalf, you’re back!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Legolas quickly stepped away from Gandalf as looked at the tan stone floors.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He is only a child.” Gandalf took the small efling in his arms and gave him a proper hug.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I can’t even stop the elves that caused the cut Gandalf.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf….<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf….<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf….<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ooh tell me about the men that took the ring.”“Gandalf … Gandalf… Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Did you see him again after that?” Pippin tugs on the white cloak and tugs Gandalf out of his own mind.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I can still see the scared little elf in Bilbo’s arms.” With thoses words Gandalf’s mind set him images of blood sliding down pale skin, the blue eyes widen and fearful, only seeing the golden hair as his buried his face into Bilblo’s chest.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>So so sorry.” Soon the Dwarves and Gandalf found him hold the shaking elf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf recognized Legolas within the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Legolas.” “Gandalf?” The elf child was surprised to see the wizard.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Fili and Kili saw the little elf as they peeked behind Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He became fond of Legolas and even more so when Gandalf told him of the Necromancer’s tie to the princling.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Later as Thranduil dared to lock away the Dwarves Legolas begged his father not to.” Gandalf speaks as Gimli falls back asleep once again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You are going to sleep.” Aragorn whispers and Gandalf brings Aragorn’s cloak over them both.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But see that the horse-riders touch did not sit well with Legolas.” Gandalf stares onward with out a word.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ones that the only sadden the memories and make Gandalf curse himself for not doing anything to save while he had a chance.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Tears slipped from his eyes as his father, Gandalf and Biblo were brought into Legolas’ torture.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Biblo and Gandalf and Awern, 
Eowyn, and all the elves of Mirkwood.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Eowyn runs after them and they gather around a small bed before Gandalf places a hand on the pale forehead.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf cursed himself for not seeing the signs.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Tears slipped through the closed eyelids and worry clouded Gandalf’s thoughts.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>In his mind appear Gandalf muttering over a sleeping Legolas.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn paced the few feet of hallway on the opposite side of the door to the room Gandalf had locked him and Legolas in.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>His eyes met Gandalf’s and a sob raked through him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The three had spent the night talking and playing until the smaller paler one let out a big yawn listening to the brothers argue about which of the wizards were better when it was most definitely Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>‘Gandalf will wish to speak with me.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The proud blonde king with Gandalf’s words in mind sent his son with them for the townspeople had spoken and so had the forces within Mirkwood’s forest.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thranduil spoke little about Legola’s nightmares and lack of sleep but Gandalf had spoken of them in passing.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf searches franticly and impatiently for Legolas while avoiding Aragorn.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Swerving to avoid servants with dishes for the feast that night, Gandalf catches sight of golden blond hair.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf says nothing for a moment just kicks the elf with his staff away from the humans and their feast preparations.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sighs and turns from the elf slightly to look at the space near him in thought.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf….<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Now tell me.” Gandalf places a hand on the elf’s shoulder as he speaks remembering that time greatly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>At these terms a shot of fear travels through him again and Gandalf is close enough to see it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I am craved this time, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That last time is still part of now isn’t it?” The elf nods as Gandalf’s white robes cover him, leaving only his golden hand visible.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stays silent for moments not needing to ask why or anything of the sort.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Lifting the light elf into his arms easily, Gandalf carries him into the same private room stopping only once to speak with Eomer.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Before the man can ask Gandalf answers.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf thought before turning to face the man.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>How could anyone not love him?”  “There’s a difference between not being loved and not knowing of the other’s love for you, Master Aragorn.”  “You speak riddles, Master Gandalf.”  “Ah well.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The other is a dear friend to Legolas so….” Gandalf stops seeming to have even confused himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf with a sigh leaves keeping a strange feeling to himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn approaches Gandalf, who’s in amusement of the hobbits is smiling to himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s thinks as he answer the man bluntly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Nothing.” Gandalf even in his worry and concern for Legolas the elf is right on the other issues that face them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf grows grim at this thoughts and Aragorn can tell.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“What does your heart tell you?” Gandalf almost scoffs at this Aragorn of all people should not talk about matters of the heart when Lord Elrond’s hand is at work and Legolas will fade in time.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“What does your heart tell you?” Gandalf repeats the man for perhaps then Aragorn and Legolas will find their answers.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stands before him with the mug in hand and a scowl set on his features.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf I-I do not know what I was thinking.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It is soon covered and Gandalf tends to Pip, who by all means is terrified by it all.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Legolas helps Aragorn to his feet and they go to Pip as Gandalf tries to get Pippin to tell him what he saw and to look at him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Speak!” Gandalf needs to know if Sauron knows anything of the ring and Frodo.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Legolas kneels beside Gandalf to scold the wizard for Pippin doesn’t need to be yelled at.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf, calm yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He hurt you!” Gandalf hates the last part but the ring is necessary to know of.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf, He said to tell Legolas something though.” Pippin was unsure of if he should repeat it or not.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Speak, Took.” Gandalf does not hesitate but Pippin does.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf says nothing worrying Pip more and simply moves to retrieve Saurman’s orb before it causes any more trouble.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Over Aragorn wondering if he is all right and Gandalf addressing that they should speak with the King in the Hall.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But it stops as Gandalf leaves with the orb.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gimli says nothing but huffs and walks after Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>After the meeting with Théoden about seeking help for Gondor, Gandalf knows he needs to leave but his words about the returning King of Gondor being a threat to Sauron is true in more ways then one.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf stands collecting his thoughts in the empty Golden Hall waiting for Théoden, Eoywn and Eomer to arrive with the rest of the company that was collecting them from their sleep.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There was only one opinion Gandalf could bring to mind.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf gathers all his words, all he wished to tell the ranger in one of the green leaf pendent that held the Fellowships cloaks together.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“My Lady, can I ask something of you?” Her eyes narrow in confusion so Gandalf continues.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>After the meeting and as Gandalf heads to depart and Gimli goes back to sleep off the ale, Legolas is walking through a mass of people, noting that some men are still drunk from the night before judging by the way they stumble.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s words echo in Eoywn’s mind as the thing gets closer and Legolas lets the arrow fly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>” Eoywn’s voice is soft before all Gandalf had told her comes rushing back and her volume increases.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf observes the sky towards Rohan the darkened sky tells him that the time as come.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf is everything alright?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I know for the dark skies cover Rohan.” Gandalf says emotions changing in his voice with each sentence.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Why Legolas, Gandalf?” The hobbit says as he looks into Gandalf’s eyes when the wizard knelt down to wipe his tears.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn stands in front of the Golden Hall where Gandalf stood with him the night he realized there were more to Legolas’ nightmares than the ring.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Aragorn I’m sorry but I have been trying to give you something that Gandalf ensures will tell you the cause of all this.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Soon white fog built up enough that the picture of the Gandalf was formed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They wandered to food at Gimli’s request and then Aragorn was taken to the king’s chambers by Gandalf who simple told him to rest and be prepared for talks at sunrise.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Move!” Gandalf, cape flowing behind him, rushed to push Rohian aside and pulled the shallow-breathing elf into his lap with one hand on his nape and the other over the cold slender fingers clinging to his side.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf, tell me he is all right!” Worry creased his brow as Legolas’ eyes rolled into the back of his skull.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf closed his eyes and muttered under his breath.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s gray eyes opened and pure relief shows in them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf, Frodo lives we must help him and Samwise complete their quest!” Legolas stood straight with the pride of an elf as he always would.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“He is right, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Draw his eye.” Gandalf swayed in his opinion and consented.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Continue if you can speak without your head.” At Gandalf’s insistence, Aragorn lowered his sword.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf, Legolas, Strider, Sam.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stood with his staff in hand and prayed to Valar that the two Hobbits he loved dear were not the only beings saved that day.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Tears gathered in the White wizard’s eyes as the last of the Eagles failed to turn and Gandalf gave up hope for the little elfing that would cling to his legs.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was on his knees next to the sobbing rambling desperate king and beaten, battered Morningstar.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf could not believe his eyes as they caught sight of the slight raise and fell of the elf’’s tattered shoulders.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Relief flooded Aragorn as Gandalf whispered the claim.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There is little that can be done for Frodo or Legolas here.” Gimli nods and turns to fetch the fastest horses as Gandalf and Aragorn do the little that they actually can.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf draped in white stood at the foot of his bed as the hobbit slowly sat up.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf!” The wizard laughed as the door open bring in the sound of rushing water and the sight of two smiling hobbits.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf gripped his staff tightly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“We will all take you to him.” Gandalf corrected.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I thought you said he-“ Gandalf was quick to reassure the quacking hobbit.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stayed, hugging his staff as he turned in his place to stare out the balcony windows.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf told them all of the Morningstar prophecy and length of the elf’s burden, which caused anger to spike, guilt to dwell, and fear to settle in all.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Elrond gone in search of the Elvin prince for Gandalf was still uncertain and begged Elrond to watch him closely.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>that Legolas finally despaired of his confusion and demanded from Aragorn and Gandalf an explanation.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf laughed quietly to see the elf so baffled, but he let Aragorn handle the outburst, hoping to strengthen the Fellowship's commitment to him as a leader in times of strife, while now, in their relative safety, at the very beginning.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn read the Elvish words aloud and Gandalf grunted approvingly from behind his pipe, as if he alone understood exactly what was happening but did not feel inclined to tell anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Writing is not so important," Gandalf said, cutting in before the dwarf made the innocent mistake of unintentionally implying Legolas woefully uneducated; it would not be the first slip either of them made on their short walk.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"But Gandalf!"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Legolas," Gandalf said reproachfully.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There was silence around the camp as all the hobbits listened to Legolas think aloud, and Gandalf tapped his pipe on his knee, and then blew an impressive smoke-ring.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Suddenly Boromir and Aragorn began to laugh, and Gandalf grinned beneath his hat.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>and someone—that sounded suspiciously like Gandalf—muttered "Now that is convenient."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Similar to Elvish, if you squint," Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"It is true," said Frodo, "when you spoke to Gandalf earlier I could understand but half of what you said."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"I understand you in all your tongues, Legolas Greenleaf," Gandalf said, "and everyone else understands you when you speak to them, too.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf noticed the elf's unconscious reassurance, and almost laughed in his face.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Be more confident, Legolas," Gandalf said, seriously.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"I have already done that," Legolas protested, but Gandalf continued.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Gimli," said Gandalf then, abruptly, before Legolas could interrupt or insist on wandering out of camp with the other Big Folk instead.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"So then," Gandalf began.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Yes," said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Faster still," said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Ah, but you haven't," said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"What is the last set of sounds you just said, when trying to say 'would not,'" Gandalf redirected.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"No," said Gandalf, "that is not quite what you said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Short for 'would not,' just as 'doesn't' is short for 'does not,' and 'haven't' for have not," Gandalf confirmed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gimli and Gandalf sat quietly, waiting for the elf to realize it himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gimli guffawed and looked upon the elf fondly for a moment before Gandalf continued.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Ah-ha," said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf laughed heartily and patted Legolas on the back; his grey robes swished around them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf raised his eyebrows and hid his smile behind his pipe as Gimli replied.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf intervened, distracting them both from what might have otherwise become unintentional antagonism.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"There you go, Legolas:" Gandalf said, "'you are.'<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And that is how Legolas learned to better understand Samwise and Pippin, and over the next few days, Legolas' increased comprehension made him and Pippin—to Gandalf's chagrin—very fast friends indeed.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>Thranduil is concerned and asks Gandalf to help his son fight his demons.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sighed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf perked up, and quickly reached down to calm his nervous horse.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf glowered.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf tensed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf clasped the reins firmly, and held out his staff.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf's horse bucked in wild terror.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf swiftly reasoned whether it was him or the horse the spider was after.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf knew the spider would be back, as soon as the light dimmed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But Gandalf the Gray could not keep up with his fireworks all throughout his passage to the palace.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf frowned.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf cursed under his breath as he felt his strength dimming.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf raised his staff, but to his dismay it was now flickering with the brightness of a firefly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stared, wide-eyed, as his horse bucked wildly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked around at the trees.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf chuckled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf chuckled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"I have missed you terribly, Gandalf."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked back, an understanding smile sadly playing at his thin lips.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What a striking image of his mother, mused Gandalf, gazing at the tiny creature before him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf noted the king watching the disappearing figure sadly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf smiled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf closed his eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"But he is such a wise little elfling," soothed Gandalf, placing a hand on the king's shoulder.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf squeezed the king's shoulder in sympathy.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>--FLAME OF ANOR Winner-- Thranduil asks Gandalf to make Legolas the happy child he was before his mother's death.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf chuckled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf made himself comfortable next to the child.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf waited patiently, amusement tugging at the corners of his lips.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Then Gandalf noticed something that had caught his interest since the first day they had met.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf's heart clenched with sympathy.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf frowned deeper.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Call me Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Then I shall call you Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"I'm sorry that you have not been able to enjoy outdoors much," apologized Thranduil during a quiet meal with Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf laughed heartily.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf laughed even louder.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf put down his goblet of wine, and shook his head.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thranduil watched Gandalf, with keen interest and concern this time.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf grinned, looking into his goblet of red wine.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf chuckled, and sipped from the goblet.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>With those words he reached out and grabbed the goblet Gandalf was again bringing to his mouth.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sputtered, and roared with laughter.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stopped his laughter abruptly, an uncertain frown crossing his brows.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf tapped his chin thoughtfully.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Help him, Gandalf," pleaded a helpless voice by the wizard's ear.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf thought he heard a tremor in the usually strong tone of the elf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thranduil was facing Gandalf, looking lost and forlorn.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>His blue eyes were shimmering with a vast sadness Gandalf had never seen in the noble elf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>With a sigh, Gandalf clasped the elf's hand with his own.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf saw the desperation in Thranduil's eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf reached out to gently push a stray thread of golden hair out of the elf's eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"I want him back, Gandalf," Thranduil blurted sharply, eyes moist with unshed tears.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stroked the elf's shoulders gently, closing his eyes in sorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>--FLAME OF ANOR Winner-- Thranduil asks Gandalf to make Legolas the happy child he was before his mother's death.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf tried to stifle the sound of his footfall as he walked through the long hallway.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Looking into this corridor and that, Gandalf realized that the night was strangely unsettled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf wondered if the elves were sensing some kind of danger.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sighed audibly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Having heard about the queen's death five years too late, Gandalf had hurried to his friend to find a greatly changed king.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf chuckled at the memory.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked straight ahead, squinting his eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf knew that the only link that bound the elf to this life was his child.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Legolas does not understand death, Thranduil had told Gandalf quietly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf strode faster, his gray robe flapping vigorously.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had tried to be reassuring.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>If the young father could not ease the elfling's self-afflicted pain, Gandalf knew there was little else to do.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf humphed as he began to walk again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf chuckled, absent-mindedly wiping his brow and gathering his robe folds.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf raised his eyebrow when he saw two fully-armed elves flanking the party.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf noted with acute awareness how joy, sadness and concern mingled in the brief flash of emotions that crossed the king's fair features.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf waved his hand dismissively.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thranduil turned back to Gandalf with an indiscernible expression on his face.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When Gandalf turned around to watch the elves disappear down the long hallway, he thought he caught a glimpse of an elven blade on the king's side.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When he turned he saw that Gandalf stood not far from him, his head dark under the gloomy skies.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf smiled as he began to walk toward Legolas, his staff wading through the wet grass.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf smiled in spite of himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Your father told me that you wished to be a healer," Gandalf said abruptly, beginning to move deliberately among the wetness of the grass.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stole a glance downward and almost frowned at the prince's unfocused gaze.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But that was precisely what bothered Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf dared a sharp intake of breath.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>For the first time, Gandalf realized just how young this creature was.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf reached out and tenderly touched his pale cheek.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf raised his eyebrow, and then tilted his head thoughtfully.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>With a sympathetic smile, Gandalf held the elfling's golden head between his wrinkled palms.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf gently raised the elfling's slowly bowing head, looking straight into the child's wildly forlorn eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf smiled sadly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf followed the prince's gaze.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sighed and rested his hands on the child's small shoulders.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Looking searchingly into those eyes, Gandalf smiled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"You poor, sweet child," whispered Gandalf, his gray eyes full of emotion.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf tenderly stroked the head buried in his chest.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>--FLAME OF ANOR Winner-- Thranduil asks Gandalf to make Legolas the happy child he was before his mother's death.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf growled in frustration.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Slowly making his way through the tangle of trees and bushes, Gandalf wondered once again why Legolas had acted the way he had.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The prince had finished crying, the wizard had wiped his tears and smiled at him – all was well, and Gandalf was ready to walk back into the castle with the elfling.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Before Gandalf could question his behavior, he cried, 'Nana!'<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf growled once again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked up into the trees and gripped his staff firmly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was likely that Legolas, despite his age and lack of experience, would be able to slip into the forest unnoticed; Gandalf did not want to put the elfling in danger by awakening the creatures of the night.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf desperately hoped things would not come to that.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stood before the panicking orcs, stern eyes scouring through the numerous bodies occupying the clearing.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf reached down and lightly shook the still form.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf grabbed his arm and began to pull upward, but dropped the arm with surprise when the elfling cried sharply in pain.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf watched grimly as the elfling gritted his teeth and stood, somewhat shakily.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>--FLAME OF ANOR Winner-- Thranduil asks Gandalf to make Legolas the happy child he was before his mother's death.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was lost, the shoulder wound was screaming in pain, and Gandalf was back there fending off the orcs alone.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Had they stopped fighting Gandalf?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Perhaps Gandalf had deterred them only enough to come running after him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was being hunted.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>If he did, then Legolas' fate, which had just been given another chance by Gandalf's intervention, would surely be sealed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Ada...Gandalf."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>--FLAME OF ANOR Winner-- Thranduil asks Gandalf to make Legolas the happy child he was before his mother's death.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf could run no more.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stood his ground, eying the orcs menacingly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf briefly wondered if he was indeed running in the same direction Legolas had taken.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf raised his staff.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It did not do well to underestimate Gandalf the Gray.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf twirled his long staff with mighty force and speed, knocking orcs left and right.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf panted, risking a glance around while knocking another orc with a swift whirl of his staff.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf gritted his teeth.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf turned, wide-eyed, as another orc slumped against him from behind.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Not daring to breathe, Gandalf raised his eyes – and met determined blue ones.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf held his breath; he dared not utter a word.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He tilted his head, eying Gandalf with an indignant pout to match the childish scowl.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf opened his mouth at this; yet he did not get the chance to speak, for the elfling suddenly raised his bow again, swiftly reaching behind his back for another arrow.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf's jaw dropped, and this time, he did not bother to close it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf's mind reeled even further.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf smiled humorlessly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aligning himself with the prince, Gandalf glanced down to his side.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Brave, thought Gandalf sourly, scanning the elfling beside him up and down with an inspective eye.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf uttered a soft string of curses when he spotted the stump arrow shaft protruding from the child's shoulder.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf coughed awkwardly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf clucked his tongue.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Cursing again under his breath, Gandalf raised his staff.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"That word sounds very bad, Gandalf."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf scowled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Angry as he was for the elfling's reckless disobedience, Gandalf had to admit that he was glad for the presence of his small ally.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>cried Gandalf, readjusting his grip on the staff.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf glanced back briefly, and quickly turned in surprise.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Following the gaze, Gandalf turned quickly to see the orcs gathering themselves with a smirk.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf steadied his staff and, leaning the half-conscious elfling against the tree, charged forward once again with renewed strength driven from anxiety.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The leading orc charged speedily, sword ready; Gandalf gave a desperate battle cry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf quickly drew back, puzzled, as the dark creature slowly dropped to the ground with a thud.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked up and spotted a crown of golden head shimmering among the black silhouettes in the trees.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As the warriors appeared from among the trees, bows ready and eyes glittering, Gandalf turned to grab the elfling.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Thranduil..."  Gandalf began to step forward, but stopped short.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What right do you have to stop him, Gandalf?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf clenched a fist as the elves silently dropped to the ground and withdrew to the bushes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>--FLAME OF ANOR Winner-- Thranduil asks Gandalf to make Legolas the happy child he was before his mother's death.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf raised his head, squinting at the dawning sky.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf scowled, turning his head to look at the path through which they had retreated.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf threw up his hands in exasperation.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>One of the warriors raised his eyes and met Gandalf's fuming gaze.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf blinked.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They had been listening all this time; that was why they had not moved or answered to Gandalf's urges.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You're a fool, Gandalf, he muttered to himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf relaxed, daring to give his heightened nerves a long-desired rest, as his feet blindly followed the company surrounding him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf started, his senses jumping to their edge again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked from one elf to another, his heart scorching with burning fear.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The huffing voice of Gandalf boomed from the doorway.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf raised his hand to silence the elf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The king followed Gandalf's gaze, anxiously devouring the sight of his son.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf shook his head disapprovingly, clucking his tongue.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf complied, turning to gently lift the small body of the elfling in his arms.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf watched with sympathy as the father's eyes glazed with overwhelming emotion, lips moving to whisper silent words of comfort and gratitude.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf reached out and touched his friend gently on the shoulder.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The king opened his eyes and dazedly stared at the dark-haired healer, who stood behind Gandalf with unbearable guilt etched on her fair face.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>--FLAME OF ANOR Winner-- Thranduil asks Gandalf to make Legolas the happy child he was before his mother's death.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sat on the windowsill of his room, smoking a pipe lazily as he looked out into the morning.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But Gandalf knew better.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf turned slowly, eyes glittering.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf wondered what had overcome his usually hot-headed friend.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sighed, letting out a breath he did not realize he had been holding.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The king's eyes snapped back to Gandalf, and a phantom of a smile fleeted past pale lips.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He gently touched Gandalf's arm.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The elf studied Gandalf in silence.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf crossed his arms, a frown creasing his forehead.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>--FLAME OF ANOR Winner-- Thranduil asks Gandalf to make Legolas the happy child he was before his mother's death.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>From around the corner, Gandalf appeared in a huff, surrounded by a band of wounded elves.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When the king was hurriedly taken into the chamber, Gandalf whirled around and hurried out the door.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf breathed hard.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf only hoped that there would be enough of them left within the palace walls.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But Gandalf turned, horror-stricken, when an uproar could be heard from behind.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Powerful beams of pale blue began to shine down upon the awed elves; Gandalf could sense the eruptive surge of magic shifting beneath the lands.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf pulled distractedly on his beard, taking care to remember the spectacle unfolding before his eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf watched with a bemused smile as the king waded toward him, dark blue robe fluttering gently in the breeze.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf made a face.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf scowled, but could not help the smile creeping in from the corners of his lips.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>With a half-scowling grin, Gandalf clasped the elf's shoulder.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf quickly grabbed the king's garb and pulled him up, nearly choking him in the process.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gaze locked on the horizon as his friend's, Gandalf reached out and wrapped his rough fingers firmly around the elf's clenched fist.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf noticed the sudden alertness.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Before the elf could answer, Gandalf suddenly turned toward the southern horizon, staring at the distant trees as did his friend.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf tapped his staff upon the ground anxiously.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf thought he caught a glimpse of a tremor in his even gaze.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf smiled to himself, and arched an eyebrow when Elrond shot him a glance and made a slight bow.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thranduil and Gandalf stood by the door, watching the lore master's ministrations with apprehension.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf closed his eyes with an inaudible groan, lifting a hand to massage his temple.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf leaned against the door and crossed his arms.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf pulled uneasily at his beard.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thranduil looked back at Gandalf in surprise.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf coughed a bit uncomfortably, and waved his hand.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When Gandalf began to pull on his beard with increased haste, he turned back to the elfling.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf watched in alarm as the king raised an unsteady arm.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was the first to break the silence.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was waiting.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>After all, he had asked Gandalf to help him...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He knew Gandalf was regularly spending time with the prince, but was not aware that he had managed to lift such a heavy weight of guilt from the elfling's shoulders.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Finally, Gandalf turned his head to face him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was scowling darkly at him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"I believe some rest is what you need more as of now, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When Gandalf spoke at last, Thranduil was jolted out of his deep thoughts by surprise.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stopped when the brighter-lit halls came into view.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"I used Gandalf's words to seep comfort into his subconscious mind.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Upon entering the quiet healing chamber, Gandalf stopped to allow his eyes to adjust to the light filling the room.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf returned the ancient gaze soothingly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf remained still as the king brushed his fingers over the small body reverently.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"You were right, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf reached out and clasped the elf's shoulder.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And judging by Gandalf's remarks about the child, he possessed great talent required of a potential diplomat even.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Despite what he had been told by Thranduil and Gandalf regarding the elfling, he could find no trace of a shadow in the child.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>After Thranduil returned from a brief conversation with an advisor, he found Elrond and Gandalf alone in the quiet feast hall.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf waved his hand.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf' eyes brightened.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was chuckling humorously.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was broken out of his daze when he vaguely heard Thranduil ask Gandalf about their subject of discussion before the king arrived.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"As I was saying," Gandalf was chuckling lazily – Elrond suspected it was due to the wine – as he waved his hand toward the lore master.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf chugged down more wine, and held out his goblet while Thranduil poured him another filling.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Though Gandalf spoke of it with mirth, the elven lord suspected that this may be a rather tender subject for the king.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf, lounging back in his chair, chuckled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Perhaps Gandalf was right.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf turned toward Elrond, a mischievous glint in his eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"That was a rather striking alignment of circumstances, my friend," Gandalf pointed out, raising his eyebrows meaningfully.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf's grays eyes turned sympathetic as he listened.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was not much later that Gandalf stood to announce that he would retire for the night.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"I see you have been speaking to Gandalf."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf's gray robe tapped soundlessly against his staff as he strolled beside the king.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf raised his head to look among the trees.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf could not see his eyes, for long tresses of gold hung over his shoulders and spilled onto the moist green leaves below the petals.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf smiled, and reached out to touch a blue flower.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Surprised, Gandalf turned and stared at the king.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf creased his brow.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Slowly lowering his gaze, he began to move past Gandalf, idly approaching another batch of flowers.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf studied this inconspicuous change with a scrutinizing eye.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf watched in silence.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He turned back toward Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stepped closer to the king.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf tapped his shoulder, a hint of a smile spreading in his old gray eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Gandalf."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sputtered indignantly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf squinted his eyes as a company of elven warriors and his horse came into view.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Well-" Gandalf opened his mouth to speak when he was interrupted by a piercing cry from the far side of the garden.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf shot him a helpless glance, but the king shrugged and offered no assistance.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Sighing, Gandalf turned to look down at the large, drooping eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He approached the wizard's horse and gently pried the child off of Gandalf's robe.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gathering the folds of his robe about him, Gandalf looked around.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf grunted indignantly and managed to issue forth a somber tone.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf humphed and tapped the ground with his staff.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Legolas reached out his small arms, and Gandalf embraced him warmly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sat upright atop his horse, taking the reins into his hands.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Farewell, Gandalf!"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Good bye, Gandalf!"<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>Gandalf Pov:<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When Gandalf threw the heavy responsibility of carrying the Lord of the rings out of the Shire and escape to a small town called Bree, I was trembling with fear and uncertainty.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>After being chased by the ring wraiths for a short while, my fears spiked to the highest point so I and my three companions rushed to the gates of Bree and banged with all our might on the heavy doors of the town naively thinking that my dangerous mission would end by reaching the pouncing pony inn where I should meet Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When I eavesdropped on Frodo's and Gandalf's talk about the ring of darkness, I never imagined that this would lead me to such dangerous journey away from the safety of our peaceful home.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He told me that I am welcomed here and that he was one of Gandalf's friends.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I wished he could count on me to protect his back, as he trusts in Gimli, Legolas, and Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Then Gandalf had fallen in Moria and I saw another unexpected side of that wonderful yet mysterious man.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>Only Gandalf and Sam noticed something was bothering Frodo.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>asked Gandalf, intervening.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf the White – Michael De Witte<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He whispered, "Where are Aragorn and Gandalf?"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bring Aragorn and Gandalf if you wish.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf on the other hand…"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Frodo was overjoyed upon seeing the faces of Gandalf and Aragorn.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn, Gandalf, and Éomer looked up as Legolas approached them, out of breath.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>asked Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf huffed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He approached Legolas as Aragorn continued his conversation with Gandalf and Éomer.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"I just gave word to Aragorn and Gandalf about Frodo.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He and Gandalf rode first towards the silvery light.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As Gandalf touched the light with his staff, the light bounced off, creating a rippling effect.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>In one swift movement, Gandalf charged through the light first.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn dismounted and approached Snow, with the Gondorian soldiers, Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf following suit.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The hobbits invited him and Gimli inside their tent, moments before Gandalf decided to join them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf said that our presence here may have changed the course of people's lives," said Aragorn.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Did everyone forget that we have Gandalf at our side?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Now you underestimate me, Frodo Baggins," said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"No victory is easy," said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>With him will travel Gandalf, Legolas, and Gimli.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked on Frodo, before regrouping with the others.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>asked Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I'll find Radagast the Brown if I have to," said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Gandalf, where are you going?"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"I'll be back, Merry Brandybuck," said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had managed to find Radagast, but were unable to find the two Blue Wizards.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"This is it, Radagast," said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"They'll be aware of the curse by now," said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"What should we do, Gandalf?"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"We need a barrier, one strong enough to block the curse from a part of the land…" As Gandalf said those words, a barrier formed in the East, protecting a large part of a landscape.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Before Gandalf and Radagast did anything, the curse struck, hitting their land.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>Gandalf is shaking his head, amused.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You do it on purpose,” Gandalf says.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>By this point, they all join in, even Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Clearly,” Gandalf says, affecting a tone of great seriousness, “that song was written with a certain ranger in mind.”<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>Gandalf knows how to make Aragorn laugh.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But more importantly, Aragorn was on the trail of a few wolves, and she thought Gandalf might prove useful.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It appears Gandalf had other ideas, though.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Do you know, I learned the most interesting thing today,” Gandalf comments from his perch.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Wolves are homophobic,” Gandalf utters.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I’ve just realized it now, in fact.” Gandalf sounds self-satisfied.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She wipes her arm across her forehead, inadvertently smearing blood there, and glances at Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf pauses for dramatic effect.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Your left,” Gandalf says mildly, just in time for Aragorn to hurl her knife in that direction.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Goddamnit, Gandalf,” Aragorn says, her breath short.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She leans on her sword and looks up at Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She loves Gandalf, but she wouldn’t put it past him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You don’t need my help,” Gandalf says simply.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looks his age for a moment.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Ah,” says Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When she finally composes herself and looks up, Gandalf is making his way down from his view spot on the rock.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf says nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf feels solid.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Thank you, Gandalf,” she says.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf,” she says.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>Aragorn groaned again and sat up to glare at Gandalf the Grey.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Satisfied Aragorn was awake, Gandalf let out a soft “hrmph” and turned his attention to the smoldering embers of last night’s fire.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“The business of wizards is more than pipe-weed and fireworks, young Dúnadan,” Gandalf grumbled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn chuckled at the look on Gandalf’s face and busied himself with packing up his own gear.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Minas Tirith,” Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Halbarad glanced at Gandalf before he turned back to Aragorn, his expression thoughtful.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It is a simple enough message, is it not?” Gandalf asked.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He found speaking with Gandalf to be much like the Elves he’d known in childhood, who often answered his questions with riddles so complex that, by the time he’d sorted them out, he’d quite forgotten what he first asked.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Hmph,” Gandalf snorted.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Let us see if the three of us can help each other in this task.” Gandalf took a long sip from his mug and let out a satisfied huff.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When Aragorn asked him to abandon his winter furlough to join him and Gandalf on the hunt for barrow-wights he had not hesitated, only declared himself the Chieftain’s man and prepared his horse to ride.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Indeed.” Gandalf had already mounted his horse and pulled up beside them, his wide-brimmed hat hiding bushy eyebrows and a knowing smirk.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn had left with Gandalf nearly two months ago, with no telling of his return, and she had been left to preside over the captains’ council in October.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She could only pray they watched Aragorn, too, off with Gandalf in some hollow in the Wild.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn, Halbarad, and Gandalf close in on wights in the South Downs.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“We should get off the road soon.” Halbarad urged his horse past Aragorn’s so that he could catch up with Gandalf a few paces ahead.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But Gandalf gave a small “hmph ” and shook his head.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf appeared mildly affronted, and he drew himself up to his full height in the saddle.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He dropped back so that he rode beside Aragorn once more, his face clearly expecting sympathy, but once more, Aragorn couldn’t help but side with Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I wouldn’t be so sure.” Aragorn stared ahead at Gandalf’s wide-brimmed hat, its point jutting up into the sky.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It had begun to snow lightly, the white flurries melting when they touched the packed earth of the road but clinging to Gandalf’s robes, and Aragorn somehow suspected that if he wished, the old man could banish the flakes with a wave of his hand and a few choice words.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“My father spoke so highly of Gandalf the Grey.” Halbarad’s dubious tone carried a hint of longing, as though he still wished to hold to Dirlaeg’s wisdom.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Come now, my good Halbarad.” Gandalf slowed so that he rode beside them once more.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yes, that unfortunate business with the trolls.” Gandalf’s eyebrows furrowed in sorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I had a hand in some of those, I will say.” Gandalf brought out his pipe and leaned comfortably back in his saddle.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Be on your guard,” Gandalf said quietly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>At the Angle, he had come too late to fight the possessed bodies, and in Tharbad his blade had done little good, only holding them off until Gandalf fully banished them, but the smoothed metal beneath his palm lent him strength just the same.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“They will find us, Master Ranger.” Gandalf held his staff out before him, the stone at its top dimmed so that it was only a pale, burnished silver.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The thought unnerved him almost more than the idea that bodies long dead could be his undoing, and he fixed his gaze on Gandalf ahead of him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>So intent was he on following Gandalf that he almost didn’t notice the fog that crept in around them, its wispy white tendrils swirling around their ankles and rising swiftly to engulf them all.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf?” Halbarad called out into the gloom, but there was no answer.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The vantage point did them no good, for when they looked out beyond they could see nothing, not even the pale glint of Gandalf’s staff.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stood atop the hill, his sword in one hand and his staff in the other, the white stone illuminated so bright Aragorn could barely look at it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Begone!” Gandalf shouted in a deep, echoing voice.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The wights shrieked again and abandoned their attack of the Rangers to converge upon Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They would not be much help now, he knew, for he had seen Gandalf speak the same words to banish the wights at the Angle and at Tharbad, along with strange invocations of power in a language he did not know.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But one of them wrenched its head forward and advanced on Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf opened his mouth to speak, but the wight’s cracked lips moved first:<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Transfixed by the barrow-wight’s voice, Aragorn watched as Gandalf, with great effort, brought his staff to bear upon the wight, the light of the stone seeming to diminish with each step.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The barrow-wight’s eyes grew brighter, his sword held loosely in his hand, and with one low shriek he knocked Gandalf’s staff away and slashed his sword across the wizard’s middle.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf!”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The rotting bones crumpled to the ground, and Aragorn rushed to catch Gandalf before the wizard fell to the ground.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Blood seeped out from his grey robes, but Gandalf reached with a pained grunt for his staff and used it to lever himself to his feet.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The wights approached, white light now streaming out of them, their power draining Gandalf in a way Aragorn could not sense.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But Gandalf cried out one final, harsh word and struck the ground with his staff.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Halbarad ran up beside Aragorn, but he stopped dead at the sight of Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ever since Gandalf and Aragorn departed, it’s been…”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn and Halbarad race to bring an injured Gandalf to the safety of the Angle.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Halbarad knelt on the other side of Gandalf, his eyes wide with fear.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn gave his cousin a quick once-over—he bled freely from a cut on his shoulder, but nothing more—before he turned his attention back to Gandalf, the wizard’s eyes glassy and unfocused.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Help me,” he grunted to Halbarad, who took the makeshift bandage and carefully slid the under Gandalf’s back.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’m…perfectly capable of walking there, you know.” Gandalf’s speech was slurred.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn turned back to look at Gandalf and took the wizard’s hand in his own.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf tried to sit up again, and this time Aragorn caught his shoulder so that when he fell back it was into Aragorn’s lap.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Rest, Gandalf.” Aragorn slipped into healer mode, a task he’d become all too practiced at, these past years, his voice as steady and comforting as he could make it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Adanel would say you’re making up for it now,” Aragorn looked down with a faint smile, one Gandalf tried to return before his head fell back.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The blue of Gandalf’s eyes had faded to a watery sort of grey, but no new blood seeped into the makeshift bandage beside Aragorn’s left hand.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You will find I am no ordinary patient, son of Arathorn,” Gandalf muttered.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf remained silent throughout, beyond the occasional grunt of pain, a fact that worried Aragorn more than anything.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Four days, if we ride hard.” A great bruise had formed around Halbarad’s right eye, and he looked down at Gandalf in worry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf rode in front of Aragorn on Maebrôg, too weak to hold his own in the saddle.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Foolish,” Gandalf muttered once.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But he trailed off without finishing the sentence, and Aragorn could only murmur pointless reassurances into Gandalf’s ear.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf remained dry atop the horse, but he could no longer stay upright in the saddle.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Her face changed from relief upon seeing Aragorn to horror at the sight of Gandalf, before she masked it quickly with the businesslike expression he knew so well.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>A wild-haired Captain Meldroch came up to take the reins of the horse from Aragorn, and he dismounted as carefully as he could before he lowered Gandalf from the saddle.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Both of them.” Nethril came up and took Gandalf’s other arm, her face white.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They maneuvered Gandalf onto it and brought him across the settlement to where the healer’s cottage stood, soft yellow light emanating from its windows.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Her face fell at the sight of Gandalf, and she helped Aragorn maneuver him onto the bed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“There are evils of this world beyond the healing powers of a Dúnadan.” Ivorwen’s voice quavered, but her hands were steady when she cut away the ruins of Gandalf’s robes and removed the bandage Aragorn had tied around his wound.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Carefully, she cleaned away dirt from the road that still clung to Gandalf and reapplied a dressing to his wound.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He hardly cared, with Gandalf lying prone on the bed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>A cold, soft hand slid into his own, and he looked to see that Adanel had joined them, her eyes hollow when she looked down at Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He ran a free hand through his tangled hair, sudden despair shooting through him at the memory of Gandalf’s collapse.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She led him back to Gandalf’s room, the scent of athelas sharper than it had been last night, and he stopped at the threshold to see the wizard lying asleep on the bed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Stories of Gandalf stretched back to the first Chieftain of the Dúnedain, and it was almost impossible to fathom that after all that time, the wizard’s great deeds might end with him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I do not need foresight to know that if Gandalf the Grey dies, a shadow will extend upon these lands we may be powerless to face.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The truth of her words weighed almost physically upon him, but he sent her to take some rest of her own while he stood watch over Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There was only one person now who could possibly save Gandalf, and he was miles away, in the valley Aragorn had once called home.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The door to Gandalf’s room stood open, and she stopped at the threshold to see Elrond seated at the wizard’s bedside.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He stretched a strong, elegant hand over Gandalf’s forehead, his head bent so that his hair fell over his face.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn sat beside him, his gaze not leaving Gandalf’s motionless form, and he held Elrond’s other hand within both his own.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He’ll be staying with us until Gandalf is healed.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We have a shortage of men  now , and a threat from the west we have little measure of, unless you wish to tell me Gandalf banished every wight from Cardolan.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn shows Elrond around the Angle, Gandalf receives a stern talking-to, and Ivorwen shares her insights.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ivorwen greeted them with relief at the healer’s cottage and led them back to Gandalf’s room, where he still slept soundly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>At last, Gandalf stirred, his eyes bleary as they registered the Elven lord standing above him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Ah.” Slowly, Gandalf pushed himself up into a sitting position, but fell back against the pillows.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I remember everything,” Gandalf said faintly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Where would the fate of Men be, if Gandalf the Grey had lost his life in an empty barrow of the South Downs?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“They would be hounded by houseless spirits, for one thing,” Gandalf answered with some consternation.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You cannot hide the boy away any longer, Elrond,” Gandalf interrupted.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf smiled at him, a hint of wistfulness behind his eyes, before he turned back to Elrond.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Precisely,” Gandalf agreed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Somehow, Gandalf’s support threw his earlier resolve into disarray, the clarity of his future far more daunting than the abstract.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You know the dreams that have plagued me, Gandalf, of Minas Tirith and beyond.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>To this, Gandalf had no answer, and only looked down at his hands clasped before him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf bowed his head in acknowledgement, and Aragorn stood to face his grandmother.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf cleared his throat softly, though it quickly turned into a hacking cough.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“If you’re well enough by spring,” Elrond said tartly, and he finally approached Gandalf with the foul-smelling brew in his hands.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I am not the one who started this argument,” Gandalf grumbled, but he drank the potion obediently and settled back against the pillows.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But he…he broke free of them, kept their chief from destroying Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>With Gandalf out of danger and the future somewhat in order, a sense of calm settled over Aragorn, one he had not felt since before the barrow-wights first came upon the Angle.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf is well enough by now.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf is well enough to leave the healer’s cottage.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Adanel and Faelhen joined them both just as they started ladling out soup into bowls, and Elrond escorted Gandalf in through the doorway, the wizard still leaning heavily on his staff.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Adanel’s eyes narrowed briefly at the sight of Gandalf, but she composed herself so quickly Argaorn wondered if he imagined it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I cannot recall the last time Gandalf the Grey dined with the Chieftain of the Dúnedain.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It was midsummer,” Gandalf said, his eyes distant from memory.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Elrond appeared as serene as ever, but a shadow passed over his eyes Aragorn knew well, and Gandalf looked deeply abashed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>To put aside Gandalf, Arwen, even Elrond, and anchor his choice in the members of his house.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Faelhen and Gandalf sat over a box of dice, Faelhen’s expression dangerously vindictive, and Nethril and Elrond spoke quietly together beside the fire.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>A sharp curse from Gandalf broke them out of their tune, and they glanced over to see Faelhen pocketing a handful of coins in silent triumph.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf shook his head, clearly put out, and levered himself to his feet with his staff.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf lingered, groaning as he lowered himself into a chair beside Aragorn.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Nethril resumed her playing, losing herself in a long, complicated ballad, and Gandalf leaned over to speak quietly in his ear.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yes, I will talk with her in the morning.” Gandalf frowned.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn nodded, and glanced sidelong at Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Oh, I had an inkling,” Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Even those will be strangers to you before the end,” Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But Gandalf’s hand gripped his tight, renewed vitality soaring through him, and Aragorn took it as a promise to them both.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>In this part of the world, I am called Gandalf, but in the South, I am known as Incánus, and Tharkûn amongst the Dwarves," replied the stranger.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn invited Gandalf back to Esteldín, where he was residing with some of his kin.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn and Gandalf were walking back to Esteldín, when Gandalf sensed something, and faltered for a moment.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Elladan's gaze fell on Gandalf and his eyes widened.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf, however, took out his pipe, filled it with pipe-weed, and lit it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>wondered Gandalf, putting out his pipe and cleaning it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf announced he was leaving the next morning.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The Ranger first rode on the green fields of Rohan in the start of May, ten months after he had met Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn recognised the words the King spoke as the words Gandalf had told him ten months ago, but he was not surprised, for the  Istari  were known for their gift of foresight.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The Ranger had advised the Steward numerous times not to put trust into Saruman the White, but to seek the wisdom and council of Gandalf the Grey instead.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was overruled after Gandalf himself went to Dol Guldur, and confirmed the Necromancer was really the Dark Lord.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Gandalf, I did not think I would be meeting you here," he stated, smiling warmly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Denethor is a wise man, it is a pity he thinks so foolishly," remarked Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"As for Lady Arwen," continued Gandalf, successfully catching the other man's attention.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Denethor and I were just talking about your upcoming mission, Thorongil," - he turned his gaze from the Ranger to Gandalf - "I did not know you were coming to visit,  Mithrandir ."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was pulled out his thoughts by the door opening and Gandalf stepping in.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But I will surely give your gift to one of the brothers, or Lord Elrond, so they could pass it on to her," promised Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"We need to talk," said the man and tugged the Ranger onto the wall of the Citadel, into the same place where he had talked with Gandalf two weeks prior.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He gasped softly and brought his hand to it, carefully caressing the White Tree pendant, as it was the very necklace he had given to Gandalf when he was serving in Gondor.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
The Ranger was faced with the piercing black eyes of Gandalf the Grey.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"Why have I been graced with the honourable presence of Gandalf the Grey?"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"I have a task for you, and it is in need of utmost care," - Gandalf leaned closer - "but we cannot speak of it here, for we may be heard," he whispered.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf nodded and both men finished their meals before standing up.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was smoking his pipe, occasionally blowing out neat smoke rings.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Finally, the Wizard spoke, pulling Aragorn out of his thoughts, "I need your help, Aragorn," - Gandalf paused to exhale a whiff of smoke - "as of late, certain sources of mine have noticed birds and animals gathering near the borders of the Shire.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf blew out a perfect smoke ring and started speaking.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
When Gandalf had finished his story, Aragorn pondered for a moment.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"Thank you, Aragorn," Gandalf smiled widely.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf accompanied him to the Gate of Bree-town, before riding off to do his own private errands.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"Make haste for Esteldín, Aragorn," said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf nodded and rode away, turning south on the Greenway road.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"But lo, I am here in request of Gandalf the Grey.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He had been summoned to Imladris by Gandalf, as the Wizard needed to tell the Ranger important news one could not safely pass via letters.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The Ranger, thus, tried to calm his curiosity by reading the book while he waited for Gandalf to arrive.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf, at last, stepped into the hall and approached Aragorn.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"Welcome, Gandalf," said the Ranger, bowing his head.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It seemed as if Gandalf had grown older within the past year, for even more lines of worry were etched onto his wise wrinkled face.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>At the end of his birthday speech, the Hobbit used his ring and departed from Shire, never to return," - Gandalf paused and blew out a smoke ring - "however, on the morning of his departure, he admitted that the ring was tiring him greatly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Aragorn listened to the Wizard's tale and frowned, "Are you sure about this, Gandalf?"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"This leads me to the problem, my dear friend," sighed Gandalf, and put out his pipe.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf nodded, "I am most thankful you offer to help me, and I accept.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"But Gandalf, what becomes of this ring now?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
The next morning, Gandalf and Aragorn were asked to meet Elrond in his study before departure.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Where we will go next, I do not know yet, we will follow in the creature's footprints," replied Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf placed a hand on his heart and bowed his head, leaving the room.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Aragorn and Gandalf followed the footprints of Gollum into a riverside village.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf and Aragorn decided to stay the night in a local inn, as both men desired to sleep in a warm bed after the previous nights' strange sleeping arrangements.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Aragorn looked and Gandalf meaningfully.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf nodded and then looked back at the newcomer, who, judging by his gear, also seemed to be a fisherman.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Aragorn moved to unsheathe his sword but was stopped by Gandalf, who pressed a finger on his lips.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf took off his hand from Aragorn's hilt and nodded towards Gollum.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gollum could have been killed fifty years ago, but he was spared by Bilbo," said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf leaned on his staff and looked at the man, "Pity is what stopped Bilbo's hand all those years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf and Aragorn turned in for the night.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Follow me, Aragorn," said Gandalf upon entering the library.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He then approached Gandalf and continued to walk alongside the other man.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf waved as they approached the duo.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Gandalf, how nice it is for you to join us," - he jumped up from the bench and hugged Gandalf - "I was just telling Lady Arwen about our quest to Erebor."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Aragorn, I wanted you to meet Bilbo Baggins, the Hobbit who accompanied the Dwarves to Erebor," said Gandalf after he had straightened up once again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn and Gandalf moved to sit down with Bilbo and Arwen.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When I asked Gandalf about you, he only smiled to himself but said nothing of the matter.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf mentioned earlier you are the Chieftain of the Dúnedain.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf made his smoke cloud in the shape of a dragon and blew it through the ring.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He then walked away with Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>A few days later, Gandalf and Aragorn decided to set out in search of Gollum once again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He heaved the bag onto his shoulders and turned to look at Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Over the past four years, Gandalf and Aragorn had hunted for Gollum in intervals, for both men had countless other duties they needed to do simultaneously.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
The trail of Gollum eventually led Gandalf and Aragorn into the dark and gloomy forest of Mirkwood.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>However, Gandalf and Aragorn did not give up, but stayed in Gollum's footsteps.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"Gandalf, shall we risk some light?"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The only sound he could hear was the rustling of leaves and the sound of Gandalf and his breathing, but the steps following them had quietened.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf quickly extinguished his staff and looked around curiously.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf, however, grinned, and stepped forward.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"

Aragorn Arathornion i eneth dîn

," replied Gandalf and the Ranger gave a court nod, as he had realized he was in presence of King Thranduil's son.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"According to the King's orders, I must take you to our halls, and there you shall meet him and answer before his throne," continued Legolas in Sindarin and Gandalf nodded.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
The Elves led Aragorn and Gandalf over a wide bridge and entered the throne room, which was located in the centre of the hall on a circular platform.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf raised his eyebrow as his eyes landed on the necklace, "I see the Elf-friend's gift is not being unused."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"You are correct, o King of the Woodland Realm," replied Gandalf courtly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
He turned to Gandalf, "Does the creature you speak of look bony, its ribs sticking out?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf whipped his head towards the Prince and let out a surprised gasp.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Aragorn and Gandalf exchanged a meaningful glance, relieved that their hunt had finally ended.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>he asked with a wide smile and Gandalf nodded quickly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The Elves had generously filled Gandalf and Aragorn's bags with all kinds of food and refilled their water bottles with clear water from the river.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"Farewell, and good luck," said Thranduil to Gandalf and Aragorn, "may my son lead you out of this forest safely."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf thanked him politely.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He had not managed to pick up the creature's trail since he and Gandalf lost it near Dale eight years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"It is wonderful to see you, Gandalf," said Aragorn upon finding Gandalf sitting in the guardroom.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf offered his pipe to light it, and he accepted it with a thankful smile.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"Gandalf," exclaimed Aragorn, successfully gaining his friend's attention.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
But Gandalf only grinned, his eyes glinting mysteriously.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf chuckled, "You underestimate the strength of the gaze of an Eagle, my friend-"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I at once set out to ride North, and only arrived two days before you," continued Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn snapped out of his trance and looked at Gandalf once again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When I read these words, I knew my quest had at last ended," recalled Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>His mind then wandered to the creature sitting in the dungeons, and he gazed upon Gandalf once again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf let out a laugh and shook his head, "I would have you be in his presence one last time if you would not mind.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"Gandalf, I fear Gollum has been captured in the clutches of the Enemy for some time, at least.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He kept muttering things like 'They hurt us' and screaming agonisingly in his sleep," worried the Man and Gandalf averted his gaze thoughtfully.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf motioned the guard to unlock the cell door, and they stepped in.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf heavily sat down onto a bench and leaned on his staff, his black eyes looking at the creature curiously under his long eyebrows.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf had departed at once after the interrogation ended, saying he needed to ride to Hobbiton at once to do the final test, although both men knew the Ring the Halfling was hiding in his comfortable home was indeed Sauron's ring.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Aragorn mulled over Gandalf's words as he sat in the corner of the common-room of the Prancing Pony.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Only a few weeks later, news of the 

Nazgûl

, the Ringwraiths, crossing the Gap of Rohan into Eriador had reached Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had gone missing and the Nine Horsemen had been seen in the lands surrounding Bree.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"He is Gandalf, of course," replied Butterbur matter-of-factly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Good old Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The letter dated back to around the time Gandalf had disappeared.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"A letter from Gandalf!"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Gandalf told me to send it as soon as possible.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I promised Gandalf no less.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>The half a brick smashed through the window pane, bounced off the sink with a ringing of metal, and landed dustily on the floor, startling Gandalf with such intensity that he nearly dropped his tea, which would have been a great shame, its being his last tea bag and his being very averse to going out for more.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>A scrawny, ginger-haired teenage boy, holding, if Gandalf wasn’t mistaken, the other half of the brick.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He said, “you live in there?” His eyes scanned the house, from the window where Gandalf stood to the brown-paper-lined window of his study, and back.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Are you going to explain yourself or aren’t you?” barked Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I am not a squatter,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That’s it,” said Gandalf, and heaved the window all the way up.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As soon as he saw what Gandalf meant to do the boy’s eyes went wide.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf caught him in the act of climbing the fence into the back alley and grabbing him by the back of his shirt hauled him down.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Where are your parents?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Where do you live?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’m homeless.” The boy went limp, hanging from his shirt in Gandalf’s grip like a sad little puppet.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Very well,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No!” He squirmed in Gandalf’s grip.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Then tell me where you live,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I see.” Gandalf released his shirt.” Lead on.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Ah, madam,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Oh?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The woman turned to Gandalf and said, very wearily, “I’m his foster mother.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That would be appreciated,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Peregrin gave Gandalf a reproachful sort of look.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>In return Gandalf gave him a shove over the threshold.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was down the steps and a few paces along the street when he heard the shouting start, muffled and voiceless through the closed door, and for a moment he wavered.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“What are you doing, Peregrin?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Walking,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“What was that?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Ah,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“So you sat down in the rain?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked at the net curtained windows of Peregrin’s foster home.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No!” He tugged his arm out of Gandalf’s grip.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Peregrin,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stood beneath his umbrella, clutching his package of pipe tobacco and biscuits, and inwardly sighed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’m not taking you back,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The lock upon Gandalf’s door was stiff, and took some jiggling; the hinges were stiffer, and whined.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There Peregrin stood, dripping on the tiles, staring up at the high staircase, the pictures lining the walls of the narrow hallway, the four grandfather clocks, the hat stand where Gandalf kept his staff propped.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I do,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Does it?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Do sit down,” said Gandalf, already in his usual seat.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Have a biscuit,” said Gandalf, nudging the plate in his direction.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“What was that?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Ah,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Fair enough,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I care,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Oh?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Group home?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“How long have you been staying with her?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That’s not very long,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Good gracious,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I didn’t do anything!” he said, which was certainly a lie but Gandalf didn’t call him on it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You could have explained,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“How many foster homes have you had?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Hm?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You can call me Gandalf.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf,” Peregrin repeated.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Is that Mr Gandalf or Gandalf something-or-other?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Just Gandalf,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Hmm,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Funny sort of name,” remarked Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Says Mr Just-Gandalf-it’s-my-fifth-name,” said Peregrin.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“To Gandalf?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I see,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You don’t have any friends?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I don’t like putting down roots,” he finished, which Gandalf was certain wasn’t what he’d wanted to say.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You ought to give it a try,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I missed the forever home window like, five years ago.” Turning to Gandalf he said, “I mean, what kind of weirdo wants to adopt a fourteen year old, right?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He said it lightly, as if it were a joke; but when Gandalf didn’t reply, the spark of humour in his eyes died as if he was only now processing what he had said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Do?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’m a wizard,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No, a real one,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Good for you,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I shall.” Gandalf contently blew a smoke ring.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Vape?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf put his pipe to his mouth.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I don’t smoke cigarettes,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“And why would I do that,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Well, I suppose you’d know,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf watched him count out three more, and considered.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Don’t talk with your mouth full,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Finish your tea first,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“So do I,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You seem hungry and in need of something warm,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Have another biscuit,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You ought to make some friends,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“And the other kids think I’m weird.” Gandalf leaned back in his chair, and considered.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf gave him a hard stare.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Hm,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’d say that depends on what you mean by charity,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“We’ll see about that,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Good afternoon to you too,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Does she?” said Gandalf with poorly feigned innocence.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Shoes off, please,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Magic,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Misdirection,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf gestured vaguely with his mug.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No, why?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Biscuits?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He took two, and leaned back comfortably in his chair, evidently prepared to make himself at home in Gandalf’s kitchen.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Now, then.” Gandalf put his stack of carefully chosen books down upon the kitchen table with a firm thud.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He looked at the door, as if expecting to find someone watching, someone Gandalf was putting on a show for.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Well, yes,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Don’t I?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Is that so?” Gandalf followed the precarious path of Pippin’s chairs with his eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I do,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It stands for,” said Pippin, still rocking on his chair, “attention deficit – high definition.” At Gandalf’s hardening look he leaned forward, taking the chair with him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That’s not what it means,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Your foster mother seems to think otherwise,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“If you want more biscuits you’ll have to be more co-operative,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“As I understand it you’re behind on your studies,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Language,” said Gandalf, sliding the biscuits away from him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You’re too young to be using that kind of vocabulary,” Gandalf told him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No more biscuits,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Who told you that?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“My, you have met some unpleasant people,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“One or the other,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked where Pippin was pointing.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“For your information, I’m immortal,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Well, I mean to,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“If you want,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“What does the school system cover these days,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Then we shall start there,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Pippin, as it transpired, was not the best of students, though he was also far from the worst Gandalf had ever had; and it was not from want of trying, or not entirely.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Sometimes when Gandalf drew his attention back to his sums he had a despairing look in his eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Tobacco,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Your sums, Pippin,” said Gandalf patiently, and Pippin shot the page another of those despairing looks.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Pay attention,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You can leave whenever you like,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He perked up only when Gandalf offered to lend him a book.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I can just,” he said, standing before the shelves in Gandalf’s sitting room, “take one?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“If you want,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I shall have to trust you,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’m sure they won’t.” Gandalf slid a book off the shelf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yes,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“In my experience,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Of course,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Language,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“And –” Disturbed by his attempts to force in the book, his schoolbag toppled over, scattering its contents all over Gandalf’s floor.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Let me,” said Gandalf, reaching down to help.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There was something in his voice, something furtive in his movements, and Gandalf looked over the fallen items – pens, schoolwork, gubbins – suspecting he’d find something that oughtn’t be there.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Oh?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Business?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf gave him one of his hardest looks, and like so many people before him, Pippin broke.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Trade for what, exactly?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You’re too young to buy those,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Then where did you get them?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf held out his hand.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Hand them over,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Or I’ll telephone your foster mother right away and tell her you stole them,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That’s not the point,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You shouldn’t steal things, no matter how much you think someone deserves to be robbed,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>After a long, unhappy moment, he smacked the cigarettes into Gandalf’s open hand.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Now, Pippin,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Next week!” Gandalf called in his wake.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Fourteen years,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I don’t think the problems we’re having can be solved with warm milk,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No,” said Gandalf truthfully.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Whatever I feel like,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Parrot?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I shall give it a go,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That evening, Gandalf’s phone rang again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Now, that’s hardly fair,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“He isn’t an orphan,” said Gandalf truthfully.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That was a long time ago, and he isn’t an orphan,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“We have a responsibility to look after them,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I don’t see how it is,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You let Radagast have his pets,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf put his pipe back in his mouth and considered his next move.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It’s very nice to see you, too,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He sat in the kitchen with his grubby schoolbag on his lap, watching Gandalf boil the kettle.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Tea?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You said you didn’t care for my biscuits so I got an assortment,” said Gandalf with a wave of his hand.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Pippin looked at Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I said I wouldn’t,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’m a wizard of my word,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Pippin took five, and Gandalf busied himself with his books.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Some things to keep your hands busy,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’ve no idea,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Make up your mind and choose something and we’ll do some arithmetic,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Making your mind up?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“They’re a curious diversion,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Ah,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Later,” said Gandalf, opening the maths book.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That’s because I’m as old as the universe,” Gandalf told him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Oh?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“So you are,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“We’re supposed to be studying it,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’m not a fake tutor,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That doesn’t mean I’m a fake tutor,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Do you want to know what I think?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I think you’re scared of applying yourself,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Clowns?” Gandalf echoed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I doubt that very much,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Be that as it may,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Of course,” said Gandalf, leafing through the textbook.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Only if you bring it back when you have lessons,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Have you tried writing these things down?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Does your foster mother not make you do it?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Well, perhaps we’d best –” Before Gandalf could go on, the telephone let out its piercing ring.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf gestured for him to go back to the table.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Excuse me,” Gandalf said to Radagast, and covered the receiver.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Go to the drawing room,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Hush,” said Gandalf, re-joining the conversation which had continued one-sided in his absence.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Read a book,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No – no, I wasn’t talking to you,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yes, the human child,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No, I don’t think we’re at that stage yet,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When Gandalf at last extricated himself from the conversation, forty-five minutes later, it was almost time to send Pippin home.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Well, they will keep moving borders, won’t they?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Pippin tilted back his head and looked at Gandalf over the arm of the sofa.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“What if I did?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Not at all,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’m not an alien,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Who is he?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Always,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No, I live in this house,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf gave him a hard look.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Now, let’s work on your arithmetic,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“If you like,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf shut the text book, and drummed his fingers on it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Now, Pippin,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You don’t have to leave,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Has she,” Gandalf wondered how best to ask, “done something to upset you?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It has a weird soapy smell and the bed makes rattly noises.” He looked at Gandalf and said hopefully, “half past six?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Did you tell social services she locked you outside in the rain?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“She should have had the decorum not to lock a child out of her house,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yes, you are,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Did you tell social services?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Should I?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf elected not to comment.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Hm,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|> “Are we a what?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|> “I don’t know what a LARP is,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had had many mortal friends over the years.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Nature is full of maths,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That’s why I brought this,” said Gandalf, and tapped his umbrella on the ground.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I don’t smell funky,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That’s because I’m always smoking it,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Shall we have a look?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’m a history freak,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf breathed in the smell of the place, the stone and the old, old wood of the pews.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It’s been thirty seconds,” Gandalf whispered back.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I didn’t bring you here to look at stained glass,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Over here,” said Gandalf, and led him through the church to the other door, and from there to the graveyard.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“This way,” said Gandalf, and they went past the newer graves, with their flowers and sharp edges, to the old ones, the ones like broken teeth and stumps.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He looked at Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I like to come here sometimes,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I knew her,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Quite,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sighed inwardly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I was monitoring the situation,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>So there they sat, in Gandalf’s dining room, their heads together, figuratively speaking.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“We didn’t call this meeting to assign blame,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That will be Radagast,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Before Gandalf had even reached the doorway, the bell rang again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As best as Gandalf could tell he didn’t own a raincoat, or an umbrella, or any sensible shoes, for that matter.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stared down at him, baffled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Good grief,” moaned Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stopped him with a hand on his shoulder.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yes, you can,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“My foster mother’s out at work till late and I don’t have a key to her house.” Gandalf stared at him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Why don’t you have a key?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Ridiculous child,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Take off your shoes,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Behind Gandalf the dining room door opened, and tilting his head to see who was there Pippin’s eyes went wide.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf took Pippin by the shoulder.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf pretended he hadn’t noticed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Pippin, this is Saruman,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No – no, not like that,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“He’s locked out of his house,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Be quiet, Pippin,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf wasn’t sure that this particular situation had entered into Saruman’s mind for a moment, as it happened, but he didn’t say so.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Wow, you have some really rude friends,” Pippin whispered loudly before the door was even closed, and Gandalf couldn’t find it in himself to object.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Upstairs,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Off with you,” said Gandalf, ushering him up the stairs.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Pippin rolled his eyes theatrically but went upstairs, entirely oblivious to the gravity of what he had stumbled on; and Gandalf went back to the dining room to a discussion that was cut short again short minutes later when Radagast finally arrived.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf gestured for him to close the door, and succeeded only in drawing Radagast’s attention to him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“This is Pippin,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Because that’s what you are,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Does it work?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Then what’s the problem?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“By magic,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Oh, good grief,” said Gandalf, and going to the kitchen he fetched the entire tub of biscuits.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Do I?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Of course not,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It’s not a magic circle meeting,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Well, Gandalf decided, he would take that over magic circle.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was only as he went to answer it that Gandalf noticed it was dark outside, and Pippin’s shoes were still on the floor by his clock.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yes, he’s here,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’ll fetch him,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Pippin,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stepped fully into the room.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Ah.” Stepping closer Gandalf put his hand on Pippin’s shoulder and contemplated shaking it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Thank you,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf put the mugs on the coffee table and gave him a shake.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Wake up, now,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Oh.” He looked up at Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No matter,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’m sure you’ll be pleased to hear,” said Gandalf, “that the world is no longer ending.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Not exactly,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“We don’t,” said Gandalf, settling into his armchair, “meddle in human affairs more than we have to.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Very early, or very late,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“When you feel like it,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Regrettably you have to,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“The funky smelling one,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I don’t smell funky,” said Gandalf curtly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“He enjoys their company,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“So do I,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I told her where you are,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yes,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“If the world hasn’t ended by then,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Ah.” Gandalf clutched his hat, which he had politely taken off, a little tighter.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I did,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’ll take it,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I have.” Gandalf looked around himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They stood in the station concourse, Gandalf tried to make sense of the departure board, Pippin gazing about himself at the intriguing features of the station.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You’ll spoil your lunch,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“At the museum,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Hush, you,” said Gandalf, and shepherded him to the ticket office for a confusing conversation about the difference between peak and off-peak trains.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Ah, he’s –” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf laughed, and said, “he’s fourteen.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Pippin,” said Gandalf in warning tones.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Pippin, do you want to go to the museum or not?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The clerk looked to Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“He’s fourteen,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They boarded the train without much fuss, and found seats which were far less comfortable and more cramped than Gandalf remembered.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“An hour,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf dug into his pocket and produced the Rubik’s cube.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“There’s maths in everything, if you know how to look for it,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Very novel,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“So?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’m quite sure they won’t mind,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It’s got lots of old things in it,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yes, very like me,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No, not exactly,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Another place,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“More like another plane of existence,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Heavenly,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Properly this time?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That’s a big question,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Hm?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“All sorts of things,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Frightful things,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Some other time, maybe,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Very like that,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I –” Gandalf was about to say I did no such thing, but now that he thought of it he had, rather.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“One that would take too long to explain,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They arrived at their destination and Gandalf shepherded Pippin through the ceaseless distractions of the train station onto the street, and then onto a bus that was even more cramped than the train.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It’s barely twelve,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He wanted to see how much he could get away with, and could not make up his mind if Gandalf was someone who would let him get away with a lot or not.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Very well,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“How’s your foster mother?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Don’t talk with your mouth full,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I heard you,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Are you two getting along?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That’s not what I asked,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I wouldn’t say so,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Really?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“She doesn’t know me,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“With me?” said Gandalf, puzzled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf said, “hm.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Is that so?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Finish your sandwich,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You’re very afraid of going back there, aren’t you?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I just wanted to make sure everything was alright at home,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“She wasn’t upset with you for staying out all night?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“If you’re going to keep on like that perhaps I won’t tutor you any more,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You enjoy your maths lessons, then, I take it?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’m glad to hear that,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“What was that?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Of course you would,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Language,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“We’ll see,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“How dare you,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No, of course not,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Why wouldn’t I want to be friends with a tyrannosaurus rex?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“From a distance, so to speak,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That was a whale, once,” said Gandalf, looking at the trailing skeleton suspended from the ceiling.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I was good friends with a whale once upon a time,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It was a she,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Radagast and Saruman, yes,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Naturally, being wizards,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Of course,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He would come up with ridiculous questions and enjoy listening to Gandalf’s answers, which he presumed to be made up off the top of his head, just as his questions were.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No, and no,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I believe it’s a statue,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Are we a what?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I don’t know what a LARP is,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“D and D?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“And what is that?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Is that so?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I think your priorities may be off,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf made his own selections, exchanged some polite words with the girl at the counter, and went to look for Pippin.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Do you want it?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I didn’t sneak,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“So?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Never,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’ll get it for you,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Do you promise to treasure it?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Then I’ll buy it for you.” Gandalf squeezed his shoulder.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“About half an hour,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“What did you think of the museum?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That hadn’t been the point of the excursion at all, of course, but Gandalf didn’t say as much.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Language,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf remembered a time when trains had arrived according to their timetable, and when he said as much to Pippin, Pippin scoffed in fond exasperation.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>With a sigh he leaned in towards Gandalf, and Gandalf put an arm around him, drawing him closer.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Looking down at him, Gandalf thought ah – I’ve done it again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You’re very welcome,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Possibly,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“A friend?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You’re more than welcome to, then,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The door bell rang, and not expecting company Gandalf didn’t look up from his reading.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Pippin,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf said, “ah.” He opened the door fully.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Here,” said Gandalf, offering him a mug.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Do you want to talk?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You don’t have to talk,” Gandalf said, and reached for his pipe.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No, it isn’t,” Gandalf agreed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I know,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I know you do,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf put a hand upon his shoulder and held it there.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Raising his head Pippin exclaimed so suddenly and fiercely that Gandalf drew his hand away.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Pippin,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I like you,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Why?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That was cruel of them,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“What you did?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You didn’t do anything,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Oh, Pippin,” Gandalf said, putting his hand once again upon his shoulder.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I know everything about it,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Don’t what?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It isn’t a joke,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’m not trying to be funny,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Do you see?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Well, then.” Gandalf closed his hand.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Would you like some biscuits?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’ll fetch some.” Gandalf patted Pippin on the shoulder and rose to his feet.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Though you’ve asked a lot of them already,” Gandalf remarked, mostly to himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Did he stay over with you?” she said, and this time Gandalf placed her.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Is this Mr Gandalf?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“He was here,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I was going to,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Have you tried his friends?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“He told me he was going to a friend’s party this past Tuesday,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’ll look for him,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sat at his kitchen table, and smoked his pipe.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He looked Gandalf up and down with a sullen air and said, “oh, that grandpa.” He looked up at the police officer.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Outside upon the curb, once the relevant paperwork had been completed, Gandalf attempted to hail a taxi.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Hm?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Magic,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Entirely,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf nodded politely to the driver, and opened the door.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Get in the taxi,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Where did you think you were going?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“To where?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Are you alright?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Did they hurt you?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“They shouldn’t have done that,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I understand you were throwing half bricks at people?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“At the car,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Away,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Somewhere we can talk,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“We’ll see about that,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf took a booth by the window, far away from the only other customer, made their orders, and made himself comfortable.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Is it?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“How so?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Don’t you?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Eat your ice cream before it melts,” said Gandalf, for it was already dripping.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Because I thought you might need cheering up,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Do you want to talk about what happened?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“As I understand it you were throwing stones through the windows of a derelict house,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I understand you also told them you don’t have a name and you’re as old as time,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You’re a ridiculous individual, you know that?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Did they hit you?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I told them I was,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Eat your ice cream,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was a shameless lie, but Gandalf let him have it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yes,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yes,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“All true,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Language,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“They can try and stop me if they like,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’m a wizard,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf put his pipe in his mouth, and puffed on it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’d prefer to talk about you at present,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Why did you do it?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Stop changing the subject,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“We’re talked about this,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Do you want to know what I think?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I think you were upset and angry about being sent back to group home,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I didn’t think how being shown the truth might make you feel, in your current predicament,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’m truly sorry,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I don’t think you’re a fuck-up,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Hm,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“My point is, there isn’t anything wrong with you,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No, I brought you here to ask you if you’d like to live with me,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“How would you like to come and live with me?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No, I intend to go through the proper channels,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“At first,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yes,” said Gandalf plainly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He looked back at Gandalf, evidently at a loss for words.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yes, I do,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“On the contrary,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’m sure I’ll cope,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I enjoy your company,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You’re not the first child I’ve raised,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I know,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“What’s your point?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’m not going anywhere,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Well,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yes,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Absolutely,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Then he pushed his chair back, and rising he rounded the table – and threw his arms around Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Oof!” said Gandalf, laughing, and Pippin let go.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Not at all,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“As I said,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Naturally,” Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You made a mistake,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“We shall see,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Be sensible,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Shush,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I informed you,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yes, I do,” Gandalf agreed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Almost certainly,” said Gandalf, and hung up the telephone.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You don’t have the covers on yet,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Then you can make it up yourself,” said Gandalf, and dropped the covers, still in their plastic packaging, onto the mattress.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’ll go and see who it is,” Gandalf whispered back.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was dishevelled as ever and clutching, if Gandalf wasn’t very much mistaken, a ferret.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“What do I do with these?” he muttered to Gandalf as Radagast went to hang up his coat.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Just put them outside,” said Gandalf, giving him a nudge in the general direction.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Upstairs,” said Gandalf, ushering him up.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“This all seems very silly,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf eyed his sweeties, beginning to regret saying that he could have whatever snacks he wanted for his first night home.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Emphatically no,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I like it,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It’s very important to keep your promises,” he went on, settling in against Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I used to live on an island quite like that one,” said Gandalf, putting an arm around his shoulders.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yes, they are,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It’s alright!” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sniffed.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Gandalf had encountered a great many hobbits of the years.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had encountered a great many hobbits of the years.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And he was looking up at Gandalf with bright-eyed curiosity, either oblivious to or – more likely – not caring about the jam dripping off his chin onto his lap.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf found himself trapped between disgust, amusement, and awe.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“How old am I?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Well,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Is that so?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Then I must be at least as old as that,” said Gandalf, and the little hobbit nodded as if that was precisely what he’d expected to hear.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf leaned a little closer, and said, “how did you get so sticky?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He beckoned Gandalf still closer with one wet, jammy hand.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Did you,” said Gandalf, “bathe in the cake?” Very sagely, Peregrin nodded.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Peregrin gave his hands one last lick and then, satisfied with their highly dubious state of cleanliness, he stood up on his chair, reached out, and planted one slippery hand firmly upon Gandalf’s beard.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf removed it again, this time saying, “no.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Because I do,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He looked up at Gandalf, his eyes wide and open with adoration.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Eat up, there’s a good lad,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He rested his chin on the table top and gazed up at Gandalf with wonder.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yes I am,” said Gandalf, stirring his tea.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“And why should I do that?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf set down his spoon.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I doubt that very much,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Master Took,” said Gandalf, laying a hand on the less sticky of the little boy’s shoulders, “I shall not, under any circumstances, turn your sister into a frog.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Because I think you’re both sticky enough to be getting on with,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf attended to his tea, which he had been looking forward to enjoying.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Now, you put those back,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He looked at Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Most young hobbits, in Gandalf’s experience, were at least a little afraid of him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Peregrin stuck his hand back into Gandalf’s pocket.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Don’t you dare,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Peregrin merely worked his hand deeper – and very slowly, drew out Gandalf’s pipe.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Put that back,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He looked at Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Back,” said Gandalf in dark tones.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Take it out of your mouth,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had heard it said that a rapidly-changing dæmon indicated a bright and inquiring mind.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Let go,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Let go, or I shall turn you into a frog,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I mean it!” said Gandalf, holding it out of his reach.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Frog!” said Peregrin’s dæmon as he squirmed stickily and jam-scented in Gandalf’s lap.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf took in the boy’s Tookish nose and thought, older brother.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Is my cousin bothering you?” said the older boy, laughing, and Gandalf revised his opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Bathing in cake, apparently,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You mustn’t bother Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“And where might I find his mother?” inquired Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I should rather like a word with her,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Pardon me?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He hefted his cousin, and said to him, “shall I tell Gandalf whose son you are?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf pointed at his mouth.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Now,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>With a sigh, Gandalf took up his tea.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>By the look upon his face, he was as startled to see Gandalf as Gandalf was to see him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Good morning,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“He’ll be back for lunch – probably – do come in – let me take your hat,” he said, ushering Gandalf into the hall.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But Gandalf had met a great many hobbits over the years and they all looked much alike, especially Bilbo and Frodo’s gentlehobbit cousins.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We’re in the parlour.” He hung Gandalf’s hat unsteadily upon a hook and scurried away, his dæmon scampering at his heels.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Oh, good morning, Gandalf,” he said in the kind of sweet and charming tones young hobbits usually saved for their schoolmasters.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That face Gandalf placed at once.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Peregrin Took,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You made an impression,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The short handful of years since Gandalf had first met him had changed Peregrin from a sticky-fingered semi-infant into a stringy sort of adolescent.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I mean here in Bag End,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It’s barely noon,” said Gandalf in withering tones.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Are you sure you’re old enough to be drinking that?” said Gandalf, for by the smell coming from that cup they’d been at the liquor cabinet.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Ah, of course,” said Gandalf gravely.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I see you’re as sticky-fingered as ever,” said Gandalf, eying the tin.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Evidently, Gandalf realised, this was how Peregrin did things.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>To Gandalf he said, “stop laughing.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I thought I recognised you,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf ignored him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Unlikely,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Shush,” he said to his dæmon, though Gandalf hadn’t heard her speak.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You’re drunk,” Gandalf observed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“A drunk hobbit,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Whoops!” With a bashful smile, he offered Gandalf a mildly dribbling cup of tea.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Turning to Gandalf he said, “shush!” and raced from the room.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sat upon his chair, puffing upon his pipe of pilfered Old Toby, and came to a decision.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf rolled his eyes, and gave him a shove in the direction of the couch.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Here’s Gandalf,” said Merry, and then with an expression of mild panic, “and Pippin!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Good morning, Gandalf,” said Frodo.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No – no, I’ve been attended to,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“After you left and before Gandalf arrived,” said Pippin.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Frodo looked to Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf shrugged.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Thanks,” said Pippin to Gandalf, lounging back on the couch, toying with his dæmon’s tail.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It is the good stuff,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was beginning, he thought, to understand what kind of hobbit Peregrin Took was.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Which Gandalf supposed it was.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“But so long as I can walk on it I don’t see that it matters.” He looked up at Gandalf and smiled, meaning it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I, for one,” said Gandalf gravely, “am very glad you no longer have the freedom to be as large as you choose.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Careful,” said Gandalf, taking his arm, steadying him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He shot Gandalf a smile.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“It’s not so bad.” He shrugged off Gandalf’s steadying arm and took another step.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Fool of a Took,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Put me down – oof.” There he sat, breathless and irritable and, Gandalf thought, in more pain than he was letting on.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“If you had known what was coming,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He stared at Gandalf in astonishment.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“But would you still have come?” Gandalf persisted.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’m curious by nature,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>To Merry, coming in behind her, he said, “Merry, Gandalf’s been bullying me in my invalid state.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Merry turned theatrically to Gandalf, and said, “Pippin says you’re a horrible old man.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I heard,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf says he heard.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Tell him to shut his mouth,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf says, shut your mouth,” said Merry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Frog!” cried Gandalf, pointing at Pippin.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Stop making me laugh,” he said to Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He lit his pipe, and leaning back against the pillows began to smoke without about as much relish as Gandalf had seen anyone do anything.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Not today,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>“I sense you’re going to ask no matter what I say,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They sat in the only patch of light in the caverns of Moria, a puddle of white around Gandalf’s staff.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You ought to be resting,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I know what you meant,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf said nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>For a few moments longer Gandalf was quiet.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>With a wry smile, Gandalf tousled his hair.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Raising one of his caterpillary eyebrows, Gandalf shot a look at Windflower, already snoozing in Pippin’s lap.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No?” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“The whole company is scared,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That isn’t true,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Pippin.” Gandalf laid a hand upon his shoulder.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I think you should be here,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf hummed to himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“A hippopotamus,” said Gandalf, and despite everything Pippin laughed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Ask a silly question, get a silly answer,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Hobbits are meant to have dæmons,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I do say so,” said Gandalf.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>At that moment, Gandalf, who had been scouting ahead, returned.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf asked, alarmed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I was beginning to worry what sort of conversation I had stumbled back into," Gandalf chuckled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That's how I track game… isn't it Gandalf's turn now?"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"I would sing everything, but I am afraid I would be mistaken for old Tom Bombadil," Gandalf adjusted his hat to keep the sun out of his eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I cannot handle any more of this," Merry tugged on Gandalf's robe.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Gandalf!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Hmm…" Gandalf eyed the nearby landscape, and then, with a teasing grin, pointed to a ridge off the side of the path,"That cliff looks steep enough."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was off somewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf knew I'm a kid too though and he let me go."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Otherwise, Gandalf wouldn't have let you come with us.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
After a few minutes, Aragorn came back, this time with Gandalf, and a coney.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"Gandalf, where do you go off to?"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"Everyone was arguing so badly with you gone it resembled my family's table at feasts whenever my Uncle Oin got drunk," Gimli gave Gandalf a look.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf lifted a bushy eyebrow,"and what were these arguments about?"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"We did," Gimli said, "but I wanted to let Gandalf know what happened when he was gone, and let him know that neither I nor Boromir were aware of the situation."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"I suppose I should've made you all aware," Gandalf, for his part, did at least look regretful.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"That sounds like a great idea," Gandalf opened his pack and pulled out a container with the remnants of the morning's breakfast and yesterday afternoon's lunch.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf picked bright blue tulips.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Pippin wasn't sure Gandalf or Legolas could even get sunburns, and Boromir- despite not being very dark-skinned, covered, or magical didn't seem to be burning at all.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"It isn't dinnertime yet," Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stood.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"I believe I neglected to tell you," Gandalf spoke to them, "that hobbits are immune to all toxins in mushrooms."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I'm telling Gandalf!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf, Merry hit me!"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Pippin cried out, though Gandalf sat only a few feet away.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf leaned back against a tree trunk, mischief glinting in his blue-grey eyes as he puffed a smoke ring into the night,"Good.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Though they had been practising long enough, and the others rested more than they had in a while, Aragorn and Gandalf agreed that they were right on track and in no immediate danger so it did not hurt to linger longer.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Besides, Gandalf still needed time to figure out the best path through the mountains.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had called this place Caradhras.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf and Legolas made up the front, little affected by the snow, it seemed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn, Gandalf, and Boromir seemed to like arguing about that a lot.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"We still cannot risk a fire," Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"This is the only safe path," Gandalf argued.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Have him drink some of this," Gandalf passed over a flask of something, and Pippin took a sip.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gimli sharpened one of his many weapons, and Gandalf looked troubled, watching the fire burn lower and lower.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"That will work," Gandalf took the sketchbook when Pippin dug it out of his bag.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As the fire died, Gandalf ripped out pages and tossed them in, feeding the fire.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"We will have to sleep here," Gandalf said when the sky finally turned black.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Either cast it aside or freeze," Gandalf snapped.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He had never seen Gandalf so mad, even when Pippin had broken a few plates in Bag End trying to drag down a tray of raspberry tarts he hadn't been so mad, and Pippin had thought that he was very angry then.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn and Legolas laid at their feet, and Gandalf took first watch, sitting beside Merry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The two men later came down with Sam, Merry, Gimli, Gandalf, and Bill.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"We are going to the Mines of Moria," Gandalf said aloud, as though he didn't quite believe it, and needed to confirm it to himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gimli laughed harder, and now Gandalf was chuckling too.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"Thanks Gandalf," Pippin snorted.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>This didn't stop him from talking a hundred miles a minute, mostly directed at Gandalf, much to the wizard's chagrin.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"Gandalf, how come you wear that silly hat anyways?"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"Gandalf, do you ever brush your beard or is it always messy?"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Pippin ignored what his cousin said and leaned over in a clumsy attempt to touch Gandalf's beard, but Boromir moved him out of arm's reach of the wizard and he grasped only air.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And all of them to Gandalf in the form of questions!"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"I would be much calmer if Gandalf would answer my questions!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Then, in what he thought was a whisper but was actually quite loud, he leaned further towards Boromir and said,"I have a thought- a theory- that Gandalf wishes me to remain ignorant forever."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
In one dream, Gandalf turned him into a frog and he had to be carried around in one of Sam's frying pans which they had filled with water.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He hoped he never angered Gandalf enough to warrant the wizard turning him into a frog.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf called.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"Dwarf doors are invisible to those who do not know their whereabouts," Gandalf explained.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf answered.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked surprised.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf shot him an annoyed look and turned back to the door, saying another spell.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"I once knew every spell in all the languages which had ever been created," Gandalf muttered.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf snapped.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Opening the door was, apparently, not as simple as Gandalf said it would be.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"I wonder if Gandalf will even get us inside or if we'll have to go back up the mountain again," he said to himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"Careful," Pippin whispered, still thinking of the way Gandalf had snapped at him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Stars, the first time you met Gandalf was at Bilbo's eleventy-first birthday party and I remember my Mum yelled at me 'cuz I let you out of my sight for one second and you used that time to climb up Gandalf's robes and get cloudberry jam all over his clothes and his beard."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"I suppose now is as good a time as any for role-call," Gandalf echoed through the dark.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf answered.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf said some sort of fancy elvish word and then a dim white light illuminated the tunnel, emitting from his staff.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf began to walk forward, using his staff to light the way as they travelled through the tunnel to a place where it branched off and connected to several other halls.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf paused for a moment at the crossroads and then turned to a tunnel on the left.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf confirmed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They quickened their pace again, for they were weary and needed to sleep, though Gandalf did not think this was a place to do it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf held his staff close to Aragorn so he could see as he bandaged Merry's ankle.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"I for one would be supportive of it" Gandalf joked.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf rolled his eyes and shook his head in exasperation, though an amused smile could not be wiped from his face for some time as they trailed through twisting tunnels.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"It is either jump this or get lost in the caves," Gandalf placed a reassuring hand on Pippin's shoulder.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf rubbed his shoulder again, though it did nothing to drive away the fear spreading ice-cold through his bones.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"You can do it," Gandalf assured him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"No no no," Pippin shook his head and attempted to hide himself behind Gandalf's robes (childish as it seemed he felt if he couldn't see the chasm anymore it no longer existed), "I'm not doing that."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"We aren't doing that," Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Please don't make me jump, please Gandalf," he pleaded.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had leapt the chasm as they were hugging, and now the fellowship walked onwards again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"Gandalf, what'd'ya reckon'd happen if someone ate the ring?"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf also turned around, horror on his face.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf leaned down, squinting at him under bushy eyebrows.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Just making sure," Gandalf rose to his full height again and turned back, leading the fellowship through the tunnels.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"Likely," Gandalf answered.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf led them through dark hall after dark hall, searching for a place they all could sleep without fear of any unsavoury creatures which could be lurking in the numerous halls and caverns.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"Gandalf, I'm sleepy," Pippin complained.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>What kind of wizard would Gandalf be if he let that happen?"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"I think I've found a good enough space to rest for the night," Gandalf said from the front of the group.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"It looks like a guardroom to me," said Gimli as Gandalf walked inside, illuminating the room.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The ceilings were lower than that of the corridor, but tall enough that only Boromir and Legolas- the tallest of the company- had to duck down (although Gandalf had to take off his hat).<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf snapped, marching over and dragging Pippin away from the well.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"You get first watch tonight," Gandalf deposited Pippin none too gently right beside the door.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf whispered some spell and his staff lost its light, plunging the room into darkness.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He wanted to yell at Gandalf about how unfair he was to force Pippin to stay up when he was in such a state of exhaustion.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
A pale light slowly grew from the tip of Gandalf's staff, and he cautiously made his way over to where Pippin sat, stepping over sleeping bodies easily and without disturbing them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"Gandalf, I'm so so sorry," Pippin whispered and wiped his eyes with the corner of his maroon cloak.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"No need to be, Peregrin," Gandalf reassured him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"Well, I am sorry for shouting at you," Gandalf sat beside Pippin and laid a comforting hand on his back, "and you may go to sleep now."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It would be better for the watchman to be wide awake rather than half asleep," Gandalf assured him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Pippin peeked back at Gandalf one last time.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>At least the halls were dim- only the pale light of Gandalf's staff to illuminate them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf said they were nearly to the other side.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was not enough to see everything by, but it gave them some light and Gandalf was able to extinguish the light of his staff.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Here lies Balin, son of Fundin, Lord of Moria," Gandalf read the runes on the tomb.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf bent down in front of Pippin and picked up a large, dusty, leather-bound book that a skeleton (a body, his mind supplied: someone who used to live and move and breathe-) had clutched in their arms.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Ori wrote this," Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf flipped through the pages, mouthing the words to himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf flipped another page, and this he read out loud:<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stood now, and flipped to the last page:<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Come closer," Gandalf called from where he was working on opening a door near the back of the storeroom that no one else had noticed until then.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Pippin did not get a chance to see what it was- he knew only that it filled him with icy terror- because Boromir was half-shoving-half-carrying him through the door Gandalf opened and down the stairs.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Everyone was accounted for, except for Gandalf who stood at the center of the bridge, facing towards the Balrog.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Gandalf!"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"He's Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf would get them out of this, and they would come out with a great story and only scrapes and bruises.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Nothing bad ever happened if you were clever enough and brave enough and had Gandalf the Grey on your side.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They  would get out of these horrid caves, and Gandalf would be mighty mad at him for attracting all these orcs and things to them and Pippin would feel awfully sorry but everything would go right in the end even if he got punished for being foolish.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stood great and tall and held his wooden staff high.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>A bright light flashed from Gandalf's staff.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf drew his sword, Glamdring, now, and swung both the sword and the light at the creature.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Pippin cheered as Gandalf slashed the Balrog with his sword and it fell, taking the other half of the bridge with it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The whip pulled Gandalf down, and he spun towards them one last time.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He spent the whole run looking back at the chasm, waiting for Gandalf to reappear.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"But Gandalf- he- we can't!"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Gandalf is magic, he can't die!"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>After all, if Gandalf was alive he would have come out of the chasm, right?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf is gone.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He saw only the dark of the caverns and the flame of the Balrog and Gandalf's horror-filled expression as he locked eyes with Pippin and shouted at them to run.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|> Gandalf is dead,  Pippin thought to himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf is dead and I killed him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
 I killed Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
 Gandalf died because of my foolishness.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
 I killed Gandalf-<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Pippin tried to shut out his thoughts, or at least direct them away from his last memory of Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>A remark like that- it reminded him of Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Whatever relief he gained knowing they would be safe in the company of elves washed away as he remembered Gandalf again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That "little look" killed Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It must have the power to bring Gandalf back.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There was no way the ring could bring Gandalf back, was there?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The thought of Gandalf, alive, drew him in.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I feel like every member of the Fellowship got tempted by the Ring at some point, and I always believed it tempted Pippin when he was at his weakest: fighting guilt for what he believed to be his role in Gandalf's death.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The ring would prey on his guilt and his wish to fix everything and bring Gandalf back.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Pippin smiled, but then he felt horribly guilty for smiling or finding amusement after he had caused Gandalf's death.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>His hearing was already sharp, save for the slight muffle in his right ear from when he had stolen one of Gandalf's fireworks at the age of fourteen and set it off too close to his face, but now it seemed that the loss of his sight sharpened his hearing even more.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Pippin felt tears fill his eyes again as he remembered Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Maybe it was some kind of cosmic punishment that the guilt should never leave him and he would be stuck with the memory of Gandalf always at the forefront of his mind.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"I got s- sick an' Boromir hadta carry m- me an' all I do is comp- complain and cry and I k- I killed Gandalf!"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"Pippin, you didn't kill Gandalf," Merry grabbed his arm.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"You were never to blame for Gandalf's death.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It hurt still, but now he was allowed to cry for Gandalf without the guilt gnawing at his heart.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Lothlórien seems like a place of healing to me, so it is fitting that the journey towards it would also mark the beginning of the journey towards healing from Gandalf's death<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Gandalf the Grey set out with your company, but he did not pass the borders of this land.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Tell me, where is Gandalf; for I much desire to speak with him."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
The funeral for Gandalf wasn't like any sort of funeral Pippin had ever seen.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
No, Gandalf's funeral was nothing like that.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When the elves finished singing, Sam and Frodo made their own songs, insisting that someone had to add a part about Gandalf's fireworks.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He realised that, had Gandalf seen him, he would've scolded him for giving into guilt and grief.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was going to live a life of joy and mischief because he knew Gandalf would wish him to, even if Pippin could still hear him threatening to turn him into some animal or another whenever he did something particularly troublesome or annoying.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Pippin saw blue flowers swaying in one field, and he remembered the day all the fellowship had made flower crowns, and how Gandalf had weaved together the most beautiful blue tulips to set upon his hat.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Pippin felt his lips twitch upward at the corners as he remembered, and as he realized that this was the first time he had thought about Gandalf without sorrow marring his memory.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Why- we followed him all this way, we- Gandalf d- died and we've all gotten hurt so if he leaves- if he leaves us we came all this way for nothing."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Pippin finally fell asleep, but he was plagued by nightmares of orcs, of Boromir and arrows, of Gandalf and fire.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"But Gandalf- when I threw the rock down the well- and Boromir- and we don't even know who else is alive still and- and if those men die I won't be able to take it any more, Merry!"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf died because of that horrible demon.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I see Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They sat and cried some more, talking about Boromir, and about Gandalf, and then about all the things the fellowship used to squabble about on the way to the mountains.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf and Saruman used to be friends, maybe Saruman used to keep some here for when Gandalf visited?"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That's only a few days after the Birthday, and Gandalf was tricked by Saruman in Afterlithe."<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"Gandalf?"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>This was Gandalf, different as he had been before but the same in all the ways that matter.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"You wear the face of our friend and you speak with his voice, but you are not Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"Meriadoc," Gandalf said, laying down his staff and kneeling to their height so he wouldn't appear threatening.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I can prove to you that I am Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Merry lowered the sword and burst into happy tears, running to Gandalf and giving him a hug.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"Oh Gandalf!"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"Peace my dear hobbits, do not cry so," Gandalf comforted them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf pulled away from the hug and placed his hands on Pippin's shoulders, "It was not your fault.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The teasing light Pippin had missed so shone in Gandalf's eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf laughed and hugged them again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They stayed hugging for a while before Gandalf saw the barrels of pipeweed beside them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
When Gandalf left, Pippin cried again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was so happy Gandalf was safe, but it made him feel guilty.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Boromir has to stay dead but Gandalf can come back.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Then Pippin realised that for a horrible moment he wished that Gandalf and Boromir's places had been exchanged.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was too shameful, the way he had scorned Gandalf for surviving while Boromir was left to die alone and defeated in the woods.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"Gandalf!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Théoden and Gandalf led the Rohirrim elsewhere to inspect the damage to Isengard.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
When Gandalf and the men came back, they took Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli to talk to Saruman.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Pippin was honestly a little miffed Gandalf told them they couldn't come along.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He had just finally proved himself to Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, who had all praised him for being so brave and clever for getting he and Merry away from the orcs, but now here was Gandalf, back from the dead and still treating him like a mere child!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He really had missed Gandalf, but he certainly did not miss the way Gandalf treated him like a fool and a baby who was good for nothing but trouble!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
If Pippin had thought more (a very un-Pippinish thing to do), he would've realised that Gandalf 

also 

told Merry to stay behind, despite consistently treating Merry as an adult, and he would've realised that Gandalf was likely trying to keep the two of them safe from Saruman, who was still under the impression that the hobbits carried with them the Ring.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
The only interesting thing that happened was a large object flew down from the parapets, nearly hitting Gandalf, bounced down the stone stairs, and landed with a splash in the water in front of the hobbits.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf wrapped it away in the cloth of his cloak, away from sight or touch.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
"Don't touch that," Gandalf said, patting Pippin on the head in a way Pippin felt was rather patronising.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>“Gandalf, I’m worried about Pippin.”
Those five words made the old wizard freeze.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“And why would that be, Master Meriadoc?” Gandalf asked, barely keeping his voice steady.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I know it was stupid what he did, but he’s my cousin and my dearest friend in all of Middle Earth and Gandalf - I know him well enough to know that something isn’t right!”
The way Merry now stood, fists clenched and eyes teary, tightened the knot in Gandalf’s chest that had rested there since that fool of a Took touched the Palantir.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Even in the dark, Gandalf could tell Merry’s hunch was correct.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Acting quickly Gandalf lifted the young hobbit into his lap.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>My staff!” His voice had perhaps been a little too sharp but Gandalf felt it was allowed as he kept Pippin’s head from the floor as he thrashed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The staff meant Gandalf was able to shed some light on the situation, but when he glanced across at Merry there was no surprise in his face at his cousin’s condition, merely sympathy.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hang on Pip - just a little longer then you can rest.”
And sure enough, Gandalf realised, the storm of movement that had surged through the hobbit was slowing, until Pippin lay - breathing heavily but otherwise peaceful.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’m just going to get him some water Gandalf,” Merry explained as he got up after wiping some drool from his cousin’s cheek.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As the sounds of Merry rummaging for the water skin drifted through the dark to Gandalf’s ears, Pippin once again began to shift.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>At this Gandalf tensed, but soon relaxed as Pippin’s pale green eyes flickered open.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They shone in the dim light of Gandalf’s staff, and the brows above drawn in a frown as he looked into Gandalf’s lined face.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He will not be long.” At this the young hobbit hummed slightly, then snuggled closer against Gandalf’s soft robes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You awake Pip?” said a voice on Gandalf’s right.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf heard Merry sigh in relief.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Think you can manage some water if we help you sit up?” This time Pippin nodded in response to his cousin’s question, prompting Merry to start ordering Gandalf about in a way that made him fight back a smile.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They soon had Pippin upright, propped against Gandalf’s chest as he took sips from the water skin.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf,” Pippin said, steadier than before but his voice still not as strong as usual.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That thing - it’s still buzzing about in my head.”
Gandalf knew the hobbit was talking about the darkness from the palantir, and was about to question him further when he felt a certain Brandybuck glaring at him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Try to sleep for now - you know it’ll help.” When the younger hobbit’s eyes had drifted shut and his breathing settled into the rhythm of sleep, Merry looked up at Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Slightly taken aback, Gandalf nodded.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’ve always kept him safe through them Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They stopped about five years back, so I don’t know what triggered it,” Merry met Gandalf’s gaze steadily, with a seriousness in his eyes that physically hurt the wizard.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Content, Gandalf kept an eye on the hobbit in his arms as he attempted to figure out what to do going forward.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>***
It was with a heavy heart that Gandalf had thundered out of Edoras on Shadowfax, arms wrapped tight around Pippin.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He remembered the solemn look in Merry’s eyes that made Gandalf silently promise to look after Pippin.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Still, they both knew the young hobbit would be safer with Gandalf as he sped to Minas Tirith.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>”Really, I am sorry Gandalf,” Came a miserable voice in front of him after they had been riding for a good few hours.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Truth be told Gandalf had been worried that perhaps Pippin’s uncharacteristic silence was a lingering effect of the attack last night.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Worry sat heavily inside Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Are you alright?”
“Not really Gandalf, no.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Forcing himself to stay calm, Gandalf assured, “I see a cave a short distance away - perhaps five minutes if we hurry.”
“That is enough Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thank you.”
When they reached the cave Gandalf was swift but careful in lifting down the hobbit.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Merry helped last night, didn’t he,” Gandalf was startled by the intensity of those green eyes as they gazed up at him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>At the end he added, “You did a fine job the first time Gandalf, as far as I could tell.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>First time Sam saw it happen he panicked and tried to hold me down - I ended up breaking his nose and woke to him dripping blood everywhere!”
At that image Gandalf chuckled slightly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Pippin grinned, then winced, and began easing himself to lie on his side with his head in Gandalf’s lap.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>However seeing it in broad daylight, how the fellowship’s youngest and most excitable member now jerked with no clear pattern and eyes rolled up in his head as drool and harsh breaths left his parted lips, made Gandalf’s heart thud frantically against his rib cage.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But it was over now, and Gandalf knew he needed to be ready to help Pippin once he was awake.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As he dwelled on this, there was a tug at Gandalf’s long beard.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As before Gandalf sat Pippin up against his chest and ensured the drinks he took from the water skin were small.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Otherwise fine,” Glancing up at Gandalf, he frowned.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I am fine Master Peregrin,” the wizard hurried to say gently, “I only worry for you, and wonder at how you endure this.” Truly, Gandalf could not imagine how Pippin had managed this in his formative years yet been able to become the mischief-maker Gandalf knew and cared for deeply.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But instead of placating the hobbit, Gandalf realised that he was now being glared at.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf,” he punctuated the wizard’s name with another tug at his beard, “I don’t need any pity.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I’ve been lucky enough to have Merry all my life, but right now I have you, and you’re doing fine.”
Gandalf was a little gobsmacked by the maturity of Pippin’s response.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Merry, Sam, Frodo, Bilbo and my family made sure any bullies didn’t make fun on account of it,” he paused, and gave Gandalf’s long-fingered hand a squeeze.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’m used to it, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You needn’t fret.”
Gandalf felt that he must accept this for now, although he would think on it further at a later date when he had time and could smoke his pipe as he did so.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But it’s still there, so I suppose that I’m going to have at least one more.”
“Hmm,” Gandalf mused, “I believe picking up that palantir may have allowed a small amount of magic into your mind, too powerful for a hobbit to deal with under normal circumstances.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It seems your luck is yet to run out Master Peregrin.”
“What do you mean Gandalf?”
“I mean that whatever caused your seizures growing up has kept the rest of your mind safe from the power of the palantir, and better yet your seizures seem to dispel the magic, bit by bit.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Then, “Well Gandalf, it’s a good thing that I’m a fool of a Took and not him, isn’t it?”
Gandalf felt himself growing ever fonder of his young charge, but only said, “Sleep Master Peregrin.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>One arm reached up to snatch Gandalf’s wool-clad arm and guide it down so the wizard’s hand rested in his hair.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As Gandalf ran his long fingers through the auburn locks the small body quickly relaxed into sleep, and Gandalf allowed himself to slip into a light dose.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>A sharp cry of his name was all the warning Gandalf had before the hobbit’s head was jerking harshly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Pippin, do you need me to stop?” Gandalf wrapped an arm around the hobbit’s chest to prevent him from falling.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf frowned but he trusted that Pippin knew his limits well enough.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And a few moments later Pippin’s face was no longer twitching, the hobbit breathing heavily and slumped back against Gandalf but with a familiar grin on his lips.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No buzzing now Gandalf,” Pippin said softly, “It’s out of my head.”
Gandalf found a matching grin on his face too.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I am glad Master Peregrin,” the wizard replied, once more turning his attention to the white towers a league or so away, “But you should rest - we will be in Minas -“
Gandalf’s next words were cut off by a soft snore.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Petting that curly mop of hair once more, Gandalf spurred on Shadowfax.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The men of Gondor would need all the aid and fighting spirit they could muster in the coming days, and Peregrin Took, Gandalf reckoned, would have just the tenacity that they would need.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>Gandalf placed a hand upon Pippin's shoulder and guided him from the room.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>'It was his manner,' he later confided in Gandalf, 'that worried me so, or rather, the fact that it did not cause worry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked out at the horizon as if searching for something.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>At that time Gandalf entered, and he said, 'Is this how you abandon your people and your duty?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And thus he lit the pyre beneath him, and in flame he ended, unheeding of the words of Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>'Go now,' said Gandalf, 'and tell Faramir what has become of his father, for it falls to him to lead.'<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
“
I was asked by Gandalf the Gray to get you to Lord Elrond and that is what I will do so the six of us will leave at first light, if not sooner should danger come.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>His uncle had left, intending to never return, Gandalf had ordered him and Sam to meet him in Bree, but never showed!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“
Gandalf?” Frodo gasped seeing the Gray Wizard, who stood in his doorway, a pipe in his mouth, his lips frowning, but fighting most valiantly to turn into a smile.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“
What happened, Gandalf?” Frodo worried.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“
I was...” Gandalf started, his eyes staring into the middle distance, a memory haunting his face, “... delayed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Soon the four Hobbits were playfully rough housing on the bed, much to Gandalf's delight.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Elrond chuckled and told him that he would send Arwen to escort him when it was time before he left the young man to his peace, heading off to speak with Frodo and Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He bowed to Lord Elrond and took the remaining seat between Frodo and an elderly man, whom he assumed was Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Whatever Gandalf had done, it seems to have worked to snap everyone out of their trances, but several of them, the Elves, looked as if they were in pain.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“
I will not ask forgiveness, however it was the only option to stop the poison from flowing forward....” Gandalf stated, sitting down, looking quite winded.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>For Gandalf, he handed him a Pepper Up potion.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He explained what they were and they were quickly downed, the Elves relaxing as their headaches melted away, Gandalf seemed to perk up again, the steam billowing from his ears dying down.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“
Well what are we waiting for!” Shouted the red haired Dwarf he saw that morning, grabbing up an ax and approaching the pedestal quickly, swinging it down with so much strength and power, it looked like he would cleave it in two, but the moment it touched the Ring, the blade shattered, the Elves all flinched, Gandalf looked like he was going to get a migraine while Frodo looked startled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“
If that is what you wish, Frodo, then I will go with you as far as I am able.” Gandalf smiled as he approached the Hobbit, kneeling down to place a hand on his shoulder.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Well I am glad to have your help; whatever magics you use will surely help us and I'm quite sure Gandalf will enjoy the company of another Istari.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf the Gray, Radagast the Brown, Saruman the White and the two Blues, who no one seems to recall the names of, not even their fellow Istari.” Aragorn told him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gimli, the Dwarf chuckled around his pipe as he and Gandalf spoke of where to go next, the Dwarf trying to lead them through Moria, but Gandalf wished to pass over the Misty Mountains.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“
Spies of Saruman... he's watching the paths to the south...” Gandalf sighed annoyed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“
I believe, Hadrian could answer that...” Gandalf stated, turning to where the young man had been but blinked.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf moved to walk beside him, wondering about the magics he could use and how he learned them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Magic does take up energy.” Harry informed Gandalf as they looked up at the mountain range.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“
How so?” Gandalf wondered.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And would the extreme cold not factor in?” Gandalf mused, a concerned frown appearing on his brow.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf and Boromir were the last ones, Boromir was still suspicious while Gandalf had been most curious about the other's reaction to the Pepper Up.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And when they say every flavor, they mean it.” He grinned evilly as they kept going up the mountain, Fawkes rode on Gandalf's hat while Hedwig had opted to ride in the trunk with Aldeztaile.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Fawkes rode on Gandalf's hat the whole way and when it was clear that the last potion was waning and it was too dark to see, Fawkes flew up and then dove into a bank of snow, a burst of flames shooting out as soon as he impacted with it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“
Lively this morning!” Gandalf laughed as they set off once more, everyone having taken their potions as needed and smiling at one another.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gimli was walking behind Gandalf, who was using his staff to break a path for them to keep walking as Frodo huddled close to Harry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Suddenly a bolt of lightning appeared from no where striking the mountain just below them and they all quickly pressed to the wall as Gandalf yelled out that it was Saruman and began trying to counter the Head of his Order's spell.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was still countering the spell work but Saruman sent a powerful bolt of lightning at the top of the Misty Mountains, causing an Avalanche, Everyone screamed and cried out as they were suddenly crushed under the weight, the shield shattering under the sudden strain...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“
I'm well, Sam... let's find the others...” He grunted as he got up and moved to a tall mound and began digging out Gandalf, who was cursing something foul under his breath since he couldn't move.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Everyone looked at Gandalf and the man closed his eyes like it pained him to do this, but he suggested that Frodo pick their path.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“
We'll take the Mines of Moria.” He finally said, seeing Gandalf's pained face and was about to take it back, but Gandalf stated clearly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gimli and Gandalf were talking about the Doors of Moria, either debating or planning how to open the doors.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He eyed the lake more as Frodo moved to where Gandalf was smoking trying to think of how to open the doors.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“
Mellon
.” Gandalf, Legolas and Aragorn spoke simultaneously.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Merry and Pippin helped stab at the appendages as Sam held onto Gandalf's hat and staff, the Istari would not risk magic to rescue the pair.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Is everyone Ok?” Sam worried while Gandalf pulled a crystal from a pocket and set it on the end of his staff, bringing light to the entrance hall.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Yes, passed the Bridge of Khazad-dum... it will be four days travel, three if we push ourselves.” Gandalf announced.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry had at one point set several light orbs around the Fellowship to light the path when he realized that Gandalf was tiring.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Frodo and Gandalf seem to have picked up on it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Aha!” Gandalf suddenly smiled standing up.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Finally remembered, Gandalf?” Merry asked.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gimli was collapsed beside it and sobbing as Gandalf removed his hat and staff, throwing them carelessly at Pippin, who stumbled about blinded by the hat.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf got a very cross look on his face and spat at the Hobbit, snatching his things back as Merry tried to comfort Pippin, assuring him he wasn't at fault, since he couldn't see and Gandalf had been the one to dump his things on him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Harry frowned at Gandalf, not liking that he had snapped at Pippin, but before he could say or do anything, drumming from deep in the mines began and a loud noise began filling the shaft as creatures began to climb toward the intruders.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>This startled the others who looked to Gandalf, who stared at this with wide eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Directions!” Harry called to Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Harry ordered Aldeztaile from the directions that Gandalf gave them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf, how much further?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Fly quickly!” Gandalf barked, as they hurried down the stairs.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Taking a Pepper Up as well, he caught his breath as he watched Legolas jump the gap first, springing across it with ease, he caught several arrows out of the air and fired them back at the Orcs before holding his hand out for Gandalf as the old wizard made his leap, stumbling a bit.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Legolas and Gandalf steadied him as Harry cast several arrow spells and even a Purple Firecracker Spell, the purple firecrackers startling the Orcs long enough to allow Gimli, who had snapped at Aragorn about no one tossing a Dwarf, across the gap and almost falling back.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Amazing...” Gandalf gasped, but quickly shook his head and lead them toward the Bridge of Khazad-dum.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn, Harry and Gandalf stopped as a roar filled the mines.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“It's a Balrog... T'is a foe beyond any of you, go, run!” Gandalf ordered, shoving Harry and then Aragorn onto the bridge.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
They moved quick, but noticed Gandalf did not move with them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Gandalf--”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I am trusting you to protect them.” Gandalf told him, looking him in the eye with this resigned, but sad look in his eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Gandalf--” He froze, his lungs stalled as his eyes widened with fear as he heard it... some thing dark and ominous.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Hadrian?” Gandalf worried.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“Wait, Gandalf!” Frodo cried realizing the old man wasn't coming, Gandalf however ignored them turned to face the creature that appeared from the dark, all shadow and fire.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But Gandalf raised his sword and staff, beginning a chant that echoed all throughout the mines.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
The Balrog growled, pulling a sword of flames from thin air as it stepped onto the bridge and raised its arm to strike the old fool down, but Gandalf brought sword and staff down on the bridge a deafening thunderclap filled the area as Gandalf's voice rang out with power and rage.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>For a moment everyone paused, smiling as Gandalf turned to follow them, but then something black and flame whipped up and snatched Gandalf by his feet.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Sam, Merry and Pippin huddled together sobbing as Gimli struggled against Boromir's hold, shouting about going back to help Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf knew what he was doing and chose to save us, to give us time to escape.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Let us keep going, we have to destroy that thing as quickly as possible or Gandalf's death would be in vain and hundreds more, if not thousands will suffer because its still here...” Aragorn told him, a small bit of manipulation that sparked the determination in the Hobbit keep going.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The Elf offered him a tight little smile, the pain just as clear on his face for the loss of Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Tell me where is Gandalf?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>If I cannot seek council with Gandalf, I hope you will not mind sitting council with me at a later time when you are not tired or heavy hearted with grief.” The male spoke, turning to his wife, kissing her cheek and leaving them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The mirth died completely when the Elves began to sing and it reminded them that Gandalf was not here.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“A lament for Gandalf...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Legolas wasn't there, most likely speaking with the other Elves or perhaps mourning in private, he's known Gandalf a lot longer than anyone after all.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf's death had been a painful blow for them all and never again did he wish to hear that painful wail from the young Wizard's lips.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf?” Aragorn ventured, not truly believing his eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf?” The man asked, confused before his blue eyes lit up with understanding.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Ah yes, that was my name, Gandalf the Gray...<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But no longer, I am Gandalf the White and I return to you now at the turn of the tide...”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf then let out a lilting whistle that was both beautiful and haunting and as if born from the air a grand white horse, larger and faster than even the Rohan raised steeds, came racing up to them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Indeed he is... Hello old friend, will you lend me your aid once more?” Gandalf chuckled, greeting the horse, whose eyes were much too intelligent for a mere animal.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Your hands would regain their former strength if you take up your sword, Theoden King...” Gandalf chuckled, amused as the Man stood, holding his sword before turning to the angelic like being who has his traitorous adviser pinned under his glare alone.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Bleached?” Gandalf blinked before remembering the conversations they held back when he was the Gray and chuckled deeply.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You're being quite harsh.” Gandalf frowned.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“There is little hope for him, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>His time is nearly up and I will not deny my guardian his pound of flesh since I robbed him of two souls already.” Harry and Gandalf locked eyes and the younger wizard gently entered the ancient mind and showed him what Frodo's fate would have been as well as Theodred's fate if he hadn't sacrificed his powers twice over.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Both him and Saruman...” Gandalf conceded.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Noted...” Gandalf then turned to Theoden, who was happily embracing his son, who was very much alive.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He'd been hovering the last few days as Theoden, Theodred, Gandalf, Boromir and Aragorn held war council and finally came to the decision of moving the survivors and refugees to Helm's Deep.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The bond belonging to Gandalf the Gray was dead, but wrapped around the new one belonging to Gandalf the White.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf had left the day they arrived, hoping to reach the Rohirrim and bring them back.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Harry rode behind Legolas as Gimli sat behind Boromir, Aragorn, Gandalf, and Haldir rode their own horses as Fenrir raced beside them in wolf form, the LeStrange's flew over head in a strange form of apparation and levitation mixed to form a smoky cloud that engulf them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Though Gandalf has tried to assuage their fears and worry, but ultimately his words have fallen on deaf ears.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“
Ahh.... Young master Gandalf...” one of the Ents breathed out in happiness, this shocked those around them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Few know that Gandalf has been around since the dawn of the Elves, and yet this Ent had called him YOUNG!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“
Hello Treebeard.... redecorating I see...” Gandalf chuckled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“
Well, I will allow it, but first we have much to speak about with him and he has many crimes to recompense for...” Gandalf agreed easily enough.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“
Ah... the strange Wizard and Gandalf the Gray...” Saruman laughed, a maddened and lustful look filling his eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
The Istari's smile fell and his hand fell as well, but then a look of rage filled his face as he glared down at Gandalf, “This is your doing, Gray!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Hah, and what have you Gandalf Grayhame!?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf looked sadly up at his one time friend, his long time mentor and perhaps at a time long, long ago, an old flame, but no more.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You, Gandalf, have doomed all!”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“
I believe we may go now... And I did warn you Gandalf, he could not be saved.” Harry had told him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
Gandalf nodded sadly, looking once more to the wheel where his friend had met his end, still submerged in his watery grave.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
“
Peregrin Took!” Gandalf snapped out, startling everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
The youngest Hobbit seemed to hesitate before handing it up to Gandalf who wrapped the Palantir in his old gray cloak and hid it in a saddle bag before they were all mounting up again and leaving.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf obviously knows the Palantir is dangerous and wouldn't mess with it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Exactly...” Harry nodded as they came into the room to see Gandalf talking to a semi catatonic Pippin.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You sensed him?” Gandalf looked up at Harry with concern.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You two will not be safe here...” Gandalf sighed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The older Istari met his eyes and for a moment they stared one another down before Gandalf nodded his head.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>By the time dawn had peeked over the horizon, Pippin was being spirited away with Gandalf and Fenrir, who promised to keep an eye on the young Hobbit for Harry.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>So it wasn't a shock that about 3 weeks after Gandalf and Pippin had left that the Signal had been lit.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Pippin was getting dressed in the Livery of Gondor, rambling in mild panic as he realized that he just swore himself into the service of Denethor, but it was all he could do to get the man to even remotely listen to Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf did not say much to him, staring toward Mordor, a worried pinched expression on his face.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf?” Pip called when he realized that he wasn't being either scolded for his foolishness again or warm words of encouragement were given.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf chuckled, glad that Pippin, was still optimistic as always.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>His life having been saved by one of our own, a young Istari from a strange land donned in Greens, a servant of the God of Death.” Gandalf nodded.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was nodding, that grandfatherly smile he gave to all he befriended or viewed as something akin to family adorning his features.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Meanwhile inside, Gandalf looked up from his fight with an Orc to smile at the sound of Rohan's horns.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But Gandalf had swiftly beat him silly and took command and prepared the city for her last stand.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He followed, worried about what they were doing and when he saw Denethor preparing to burn Faramir alive along with himself, he fled to get Gandalf since the man did not listen to him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf!!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I will follow as soon as I am able!” Gandalf sent them ahead, turning to shout more orders at their men.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>!” Shouted a scout and Gandalf looked and gasped seeing a sea of green rushing from the River and over the fields, where they passed only Mordor's people laid dead, but not for long as many of the corpses rose and began to attack their own people.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“T'is Hadrian....” Gandalf smiled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had panicked only a moment when he realized that Frodo and Sam had passed beyond his sight, but now he relaxed if only a moment.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The man nodded and as they all left to prepare, Aragorn turned to Gandalf who brought the Palantir, covered with a black sheet to a pedestal and left him to it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When he was able to open his eyes and see what was around him, he found himself in Gandalf's arms.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“...” Gandalf did not look happy, but he nodded.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Theodred kept pace with Aragorn and Gandalf while their men rode behind him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“No one will treat with you!” Gandalf snapped, furious.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I have something for you....” they fished something out of a pocket and threw it at Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Aragorn would be fighting like the brave Ranger he was and Harry, their dear sweet Harry would be unleashing spells like Gandalf!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf began the ceremony, telling the story of Arda's history.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The Hobbits were standing with Gandalf as Gimli was greeting his family with warm hugs and laughter, regaling them with his tale.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Surely you can wait a day or two more...” Gandalf murmured.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It is only Gandalf, the two Blues and Radagast now, and I do not think our Istari are capable of having children or siring them...” Legolas told him, understanding Harry's sadness, but also feeling sad for the Wizards of his realm as well.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Eventually Lord Elrond, myself and an older wizard known as Gandalf managed to convince the others that the Relic needed to be destroyed, that nothing good could come from it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We lost Gandalf, who fell taking out a demon that had been living in Moria.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>We were able to mourn Gandalf's loss and rest.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Yes, well we, as the rest of our brothers and I, ran into the White Wizard only to find out it was Gandalf, who did not die when he fell, but had been so injured he could not move.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sent Merry and Pippin with some Ents to take out an enemy base while he made us head to King Theoden's Hall.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I also saw Gandalf, returned from the 'dead', fighting a foul spirit who possessed King Theoden and was slowly aging him, draining him of his life.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf managed to banish the spirit, which saved the King's life, but the glad tidings were cut short when survivors from a vicious Uruk attack arrived and we had to quickly abandon the city and move to a fortress that was impenetrable except for one small fatal flaw that we didn't notice until halfway through the battle.” Harry sighed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>

But our dear Savior, as he listened and mediated with help from Lord Elrond and an elderly Wizard by the name of Gandalf, decided to offer his help!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As for those visiting from Arda: Aragorn, Arwen, Frodo, Sam, Pippin and Merry, Gimli, Haldir, Gandalf, Boromir and Theodred, Eomer, Eowyn and Faramir, Lord Elrond and King Thranduil.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Happy Birthday, Hadrian and it is good to see you again.” Gandalf pulled the young man into his arms and hugged him firmly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf hummed as he pulled away from the hug, allowing the Hobbits to tackle Harry with a cry of 'For the Shire!'<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was even stumped because no matter how he tried to help either male, they would still be in a deadlock.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And he's sure that Gandalf would somehow find a way to stay as well.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf did it as well, but at random times, which was even creepier, amazingly enough.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Haldir and Eomer smiled at the happy Devi chatting with his friends, Theodred in his kingly garb was pressed into Boromir's side, looking very happy as Gandalf chuckled, having brought along his famous fireworks and smiling with twinkling eyes that did not hide malice, but shown with genuine love and delight.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They all chatter, make introductions, Harry almost immediately regrets letting Hermione, Gandalf and Elrond from meeting each other and even worse, the pregnant women.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And Gandalf's been known to be super scary when only annoyed or slightly miffed, outright anger?” Frodo points out.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was talking to Neville, who happily transfigures his formal white robes into an inverted version of Santa Claus's outfit making him smile like a child getting to have cake before supper.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And let's not forget Gandalf, the man may be a daffy fool most days, but we know that he is very knowledgeable and can be a fierce warrior when needed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>She bested Gandalf in a game of words!”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>His bonds to his Coven shine brightly in his mind, Silver bands connect to Elrond, Thranduil, Galadriel, Celeborn and Gandalf with Severus, Sirius, Remus and Tom, his Paternal bonds.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Introductions are made and shocked reveals when the remaining Istari appear, the Two Blues, Yüri and Yänri, made surprise appearances as well as blasting Gandalf out of the water, revealing his status as a Servant of the Gods.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>Saruman the White gave Gandalf the Grey a dirty look as the other wizard strode along with a jolly expression on his face.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Give it some time," Gandalf chuckled.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stumbled forward, fell to his knees and ended up with his head resting on Saruman's shoulder.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf patted him on the back and pushed himself to his feet.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Saruman grunted in irritation as Gandalf swung his arms jauntily and performed the ancient dance known as the Funky Chicken.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Unless we cause some misery or mayhem soon, Gandalf, I shall be forced to beat you with my staff for amusement!"<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf did a twirl.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf burst into laughter.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Denethor scrambled for his cloak as Elladan, Glorfindel and Gandalf joined Elrohir.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Now calm down," Gandalf advised, snorting some more rainbow powder.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf yelled, appearing from nowhere and tossing flower petals in the air.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>FRODO
(weak relief)
Gandalf!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>FRODO (CONT’D)
But what happened, Gandalf?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>FRODO
Gandalf!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I knew I oughtn’t to have listened to Mr. Gandalf when he sent me off to find something to massage your bum.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I asked every perishing Elf in this place, Mr. Gandalf, and not a one of ‘em has heard of yak cream.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>SAM
But don’t you worry, Frodo dear, if there ain’t no yak cream, we’ll find something else, won’t we, Mr. Gandalf?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>ELROND
(eyebrows raised)
Beginning to mend, Gandalf?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Maybe you should look into that yak cream Gandalf was telling Sam about.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>ELROND:
Gandalf, we have a Council coming up tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>ELROND
(muttering)
So everyone believes a Ranger, do they, Gandalf?<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>And named Gandalf or Radagast or other such names?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Radagast with his animals or Saruman and Gandalf with each other.”<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>Gandalf tried pushing his arms forward but strained against the force of Saruman’s magical hold.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf felt very much like a butterfly pinned against a board by a collector.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“How foolish of you to think you have any power here.”
“You are the fool, Saruman the wise, if you think aligning with Sauron will bring anything but your own ruin.”
“You talk of ruin, Gandalf?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I will show you a taste of what the fires of Mordor can bring.” Saruman moved forward to Gandalf and ran a calloused hand across his cheek.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sneered at the hand caressing his face and spat at Saruman.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You speak of darkness as if it is unknown to you…” Saruman cupped Gandalf’s face, squeezing hard.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“But I know what simmers beneath your careful guise, the power that waits to be used, the lusts unfulfilled.” He released Gandalf, and the Grey Wizard snapped at Saruman’s hand as he stepped away.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Straining once more, Gandalf tried in vain to break free of his magical bonds.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“The will of Sauron is absolute, Gandalf!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Succumb to this, to the ecstasy of the power Mordor can provide.” Saruman twisted his hand, and with the movement, Gandalf could feel his robes loosening, opening, sliding away from him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He flicked his wrist and all at once Gandalf was nude, still held against the wall.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Stop th—” Gandalf’s plea was cut short by the feeling of something entering his mouth, though he saw nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Silence!” Another unseen tendril coiled around Gandalf’s manhood.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf tried desperately to will his body to ignore the sensations, to remain calm.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf squeezed his eyes closed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Enjoying yourself?” Gandalf could feel tears stinging the corners of his eyes, he dared not meet Saruman’s own.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I can see that you are Gandalf, I can see that you are.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Suddenly Gandalf felt himself being spread by another moist tendril.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The tendril at his entrance probed deeper, feeling thicker now, and dragged against something inside of Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Again the tendril pressed against this spot and Gandalf twisted his body any way he was able, trying in absolute vain to wrest himself away.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf felt a tendril smack against his back, his torso.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Saruman stood cooly, watching Gandalf with almost disinterest.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Do you see Gandalf?” The White Wizard’s eyes grew dark.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>You are a toy to be used.”  The tendrils struck out against Gandalf—his thighs, his buttocks, his chest—it was unbearable.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf screamed as orgasm tore through him, drawn out—nay—ripped out of him by the invisible tendrils assaulting his body.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Rivulets of semen dripped down Gandalf’s thighs, his legs would have given way beneath him were he not still held firm against the wall by Saruman’s magics.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The tendrils withdrew from him and all Gandalf could feel was the cool air of the tower against his sweat-soaked body.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As the last wave of pleasure shook his body, Gandalf felt himself flush with shame, with horror at what had transpired.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The eerie orange glow of it fixated right on the point of Gandalf’s humiliation.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>His mouth opened to speak and all present save Gandalf stiffened, remembering the silken words of equivocation spoken by the Lord of Isengard.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And then the Wizard looked down at the callers at his door, his deep black eyes affixing on Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I am no fool, and I do not trust you, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
'The treacherous are ever distrustful,' answered Gandalf wearily.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Tell me, Gandalf my old friend.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stared up at Saruman, his deep blue eyes boring into the other Wizard’s face, searching deep into his erstwhile friend’s mind.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf looked as if he was going to say more, but then simply held his silence, keeping his piercing stare on the other.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Saruman met the White Wizard’s stare for long moments, matching Gandalf’s will with his own.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“And how shall you protect me from the good King below, Gandalf the Grey.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf threw a single glance to King Théoden who stood several feet to his left, but the King of the Mark said nothing, his fierce gaze still affixed on Saruman.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That is so very like you, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>But forgive me if I do not trust your words, Gandalf the Grey.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Now Gandalf frowned and his piercing blue eyes shone coldly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf drew up straighter and he flung back his grey cloak to reveal a blinding white light that shone from within him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Behold, I am not Gandalf the Grey, whom you betrayed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>I am Gandalf the White, who has returned from death.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Saruman cringed at the harsh words but he could not tear his gaze away from Gandalf, his eyes gazing in fascination at the radiance that shone forth from the White Wizard.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf gave Saruman a knowing look and drew back his grey cloak over his white vestments, shrouding their gleam once more.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Well then,” Gandalf said in finality, “It seems you are at a crossroads, Saruman.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf halted but did not turn around, merely staying his departure.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Now Gandalf turned around to face Orthanc once more, his noble visage grave and brooding.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Saruman took one last look at Gandalf and then withdrew into the dark fastness of the Tower, disappearing from view.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>For many long moments nothing happened, and Aragorn was leaning close to Gandalf to whisper a question when the tall heavy door of Orthanc began to move.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Stepping forward slowly, the Wizard crossed the threshold of Orthanc and came before Gandalf, who remained seated upon Shadowfax.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I take it I am now free, as you had promised, Gandalf?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You are free,” Gandalf replied, surveying Saruman with an appraising look.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Holding them in his left hand, he held them out to Gandalf, who took them in a swift gesture.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Pulling it shut, Gandalf slid the key into the lock and with a quick turn locked the door soundly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Depositing the Keys of Orthanc into a pocket of his own white robes, Gandalf turned back to Saruman.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Anger and disbelief mixed on Saruman’s face and he drew back from Gandalf in horror.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Treachery!” he cried, “I see your true purpose now Gandalf!”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf simply looked weary in the face of Saruman’s vicious tirade and he sighed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf gave the livid Wizard a look of utter disgust.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And then he looked up at Gandalf with a look of utter defeat and humility on his face.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Wordlessly, he held out his staff to Gandalf in his right hand.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Reaching out, Gandalf took the heavy ebon rod in his left hand and pulled it towards him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Then Gandalf gave the black rod a single hard tug and Saruman released it, his hand going utterly slack.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf drew the staff to him and transferred it into his right hand, holding the long black shaft with his own white staff.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf watched their descent with concern and then headed after them, Aragorn following.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Stay your stroke, Théoden King!” Gandalf cried, his voice carrying with it power and authority once more.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Do not ask me to spare the life of this base traitor, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf gave the King an understanding look.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>At these words Saruman looked up at Gandalf and understanding seemed to form in his dark eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s blue eyes flashed and he descended the stairs in a movement so swift that those present barely saw him move.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Stepping in between the King of the Mark and the fallen Wizard, Gandalf turned a stern look upon Saruman.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I do not contest your right to rule the Mark as you see fit, my lord,” Gandalf was saying, “But Saruman is of my Order.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Théoden gazed long and hard at Gandalf and then turned his harsh stare to the other Wizard, who stood there in knee-high water, his cloak dripping wet.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“But I hold you responsible for this Wizard’s actions henceforth, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sighed in weariness.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>With that Gandalf turned away from Saruman and waded through the water towards Shadowfax, Aragorn following without giving Saruman a single glance.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>"Gandalf," he greets in the Common Tongue as he enters the unexpectedly deep dwelling and gives his surroundings a cursory inspection.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"That is the most important reason, but I will admit that Gandalf asking me to join plays a part as well," the Hobbit continues before he can tell her this.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"Gandalf once asked my mother to join him on an adventure, and she always spoke fondly of that time.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>So given that Gandalf will never again invite me on another one, and given that your own reason for going is the most noble one I can imagine, I've decided to accompany you, no matter the dangers I am well aware we will face.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>So yeah, my own headcanon is that Gandalf and Thorin argued, then Gandalf stalked off and the Company went to sleep.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And Bilbo, who was having trouble sleeping because of Gandalf’s absence, decided to join them after waking up yet again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf!” Kili’s panicked cry obliterates all trace of amusement and makes him snap his head up to locate the threat his sister-son has spotted–<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I expected better of you, Gandalf,” she says as though the Wizard is but a small child and not a being as old as the Earth itself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“You should rest, Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf, what are you talking about?” Bluebell asks with confusion and rising concern.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf, wait!” Bluebell exclaims while rushing after him, her hands anxiously combing through her hair in a futile attempt to get rid of all the straw tangled through it.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I’m Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf the Grey.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf, where are your manners,” Bluebell chides with a reprimanding tap to the Wizard’s legs, her voice revealing her own nervousness has not abated in the slightest.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>Nor were they very hopeful Gandalf had freed them all and were at this instant trying to catch up with the rest of the company since he was minus his staff (which currently was in Balin and Dwalin’s safekeeping).)<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>A glance at Gandalf revealed him still down, and a few of the men were stepping toward him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ori clambered up onto a table as fast as he could and strode to the man who had tripped Gandalf, fumbling frantically in his pocket.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf managed to regain his feet, dignity, and staff, and turned the troublemaker who started it all and his friends into toads.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Next morning as they headed out, however, the young scribe’s face was awed and embarrassed when Gandalf silently placed his tall grey hat on his head, and did not ask for its return until after midday.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>He thought of Gandalf’s conspicuous and continued absence and realised it must all be some kind of elaborate illusion!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The company had been imprisoned in the sorry excuse for a King’s halls for a long time – or maybe Bilbo had never been on Thorin’s side: his kind had a disturbing fondness for elves and he had been recruited by Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf knelt by the water’s edge, arms held out to accept his burglar.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf could ruin him and his line if he so wished and even if the wizard didn’t act against him there was always Thranduil who already hated him and Bard was fond of Bilbo.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He looked up and saw that Gandalf was rapidly approaching, staff brandished in one hand and the other rested upon Glamdring’s hilt.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|> “I shall take my leave” Bard said politely but with a distinct undertone of grim satisfaction “It appears you have much to discuss with Gandalf.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They departed hastily and even Dwalin retreated a fair distance so when Gandalf halted before him it was just the two of them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>There were splashes of fresh blood on Gandalf’s robes and once he noticed Thorin found he couldn’t look away from them.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf stiffened unnaturally and just looked at Thorin.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thorin had always known that were was more to Gandalf than what was easily seen – his father and grandfather both had told him all about wizards and how best to deal with them far before he had reached adulthood – but that was different from seeing the otherworldliness shining ominously in his eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Now though it felt like every long-buried prey instinct was screaming at him to run and hide and to never show his face before Gandalf the Grey ever again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He was trembling he realised, Gandalf was leaning over him now and it was all he could do to remain standing.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sighed heavily to himself “What am I going to do with you, Thorin?<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Usually when someone is under my protection fools like yourself leave well alone but you always have enjoyed playing with fire” Thorin can see the monstrous light of dragon fire reflected in Gandalf’s eyes and he shudders violently.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The day has darkened significantly, or maybe Gandalf has made it so.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>This is your fault Thorin and you would do well to remember it!” There is a curious smothering heat radiating off the Wizard and Thorin is abruptly reminded of Gandalf’s affinity for fire… and that while Dwarves are resistant to flames they can still burn very well if the fire is strong enough.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|> “Of course you are you foolish, foolish dwarf.” The heat died down a little and Gandalf sounded more like his usual self again but Thorin still didn’t dare look him in the eye.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|> “Ah it appears we have less time than I thought” Gandalf mused, even though Thorin was fairly certain he was not able to speak to the ravens.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He blinks and looks up at Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|> “Is everything alright Thorin?” Gandalf asks as he steps back a little.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He mumbles his thanks awkwardly, but Gandalf seems to have overcome some of his previous (very much warranted) animosity and doesn’t immediately snub him as Thorin was expecting.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf frowns and some of the hostility returns.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>If anyone can keep him safe it is you, Gandalf.” He said seriously.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf made a harrumphing noise.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|> “I understand” Thorin says miserably before taking his leave of Gandalf to check up on the others in the company that he hadn’t just been forbidden from seeing.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>As Gandalf had planned, and once Bilbo had been healthy enough to travel, Gandalf had bundled him into a heavily padded cart and they had left for Thranduil’s halls.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Well, he had watched in secret from an arrow slit high in the mountain as Gandalf carried a hobbit-sized bundle of blankets and furs to the cart and then slowly rode away but that hardly counted.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thorin no longer deserved to have Bilbo’s affections, as much as it hurt and Thorin didn’t doubt that if he did manage to weasel his way into Bilbo’s good graces again Gandalf would quite happily turn him into a toad or something equally undignified.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thorin wasn’t sure what wizards did to people like him – they were not inclined to acts of cruelty but generally they had no reason to be as living in near isolation didn’t give them much opportunity to experience hatred – but Gandalf cared for Bilbo like the hobbit was family.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|> “He left with Gandalf the Grey some time ago.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He didn’t actually know what Bilbo had wished, he hadn’t had the nerve to ask Gandalf if it was Bilbo’s desire to return to the Shire or the wizard’s but that was beside the point.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>He would never see Bilbo again and he didn’t deserve to write to him, even if Gandalf had not forbade him from seeking contact.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>A reply wouldn’t break his promise to Gandalf seeing as it was Bilbo that had begun correspondence but to Thorin it would still feel as if he was forcing his no doubt unwanted company upon him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Besides Gandalf would happily skin him alive if he visited Bilbo!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo had only arrived back in the Shire in late July, a year and two months after he had set off, and Gandalf had finally left last week.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had proven himself a true friend, it was just that as Bilbo had recovered Gandalf’s concern had become a little smothering.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>By the time they arrived back in the Shire and Gandalf found that the Sackville-Bagginses had recently moved into his smial, and Gandalf had singlehandedly chased them out not only of Bag End but the entirety of Hobbiton!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Anyway, Gandalf had chased off the Sackville-Bagginses and then hunted down Bilbo’s auctioned things and stayed for some time until he at last deemed Bilbo well enough to look after himself (he had also heard some troubling rumours from outside the Shire and Bilbo suspected that had more to do with the date of his departure in the end).<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>So Gandalf had departed and Bilbo was now revelling in his regained independence.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I think this patch here would work well.” The old location had sufficed well enough but after experiencing the flavours of the world outside the Shire Bilbo wanted to expand his herb collection and had made sure to pester Gandalf to get him seeds whenever possible on the journey back.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf had been shockingly stingy with details of the events after his fall and they had left while Bilbo had still been delirious from fever so he knew very little about how they fared.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>All Gandalf had been willing to admit was that there had been a battle, though not against the elves and men, and that all of the company had survived – though when he had said this he had looked pensive.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was an odd change in behaviour, though Bilbo suspected that Bilbo’s injuries had rattled Gandalf quite considerably if he was willing to look after him for so long.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“I tried asking the other halflings but none of them would talk to me and then I saw the rune on your door and I thought if anyone would help me it would be someone who lived in a burrow such as yours.” He gestured at the door and Bilbo peered at the outside of it to see that the rune that Gandalf had carved so long ago was still glowing gently.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>It was so calm that Bilbo half expected Gandalf to appear and turn his life upside down again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When the round green door appeared Thorin saw with some surprise that the dwarven rune Gandalf had carved into the wood still glowed softly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|> “Ah, there you are Bilbo.” Said Gandalf the Grey as he blinked at them rather myopically “What’s all this then?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|> “Oh, I see.” Gandalf said in a tone that indicated quite clearly that he certainly did not see “Whose wedding is this?”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>When Gandalf’s incredulous stare focused on him Thorin suddenly wished he could turn invisible.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>For several dragging seconds Gandalf merely sucked on his pipe before saying “Hmm… fascinating.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thorin made to help but Gandalf fixed him with a look that pinned him in place.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf waited until they were out of sight of the party before rounding on him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>If Gandalf hadn’t been a near-immortal wizard he likely would have sniffed contemptuously, as it was he instead continued to stare at Thorin in his most severe manner.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|> “Look, I know you don’t approve Gandalf but I love Bilbo and he loves me.” he tried not to sound too giddy at saying that out loud and knowing for certain that it was true “Besides there isn’t enough gold in the entire Shire to bring back my gold sickness.”<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|> “The gold sickness came back?” Gandalf asked and almost sounded concerned.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf’s features softened a little “Giving up power is one of the most difficult things in this world, Thorin, don’t be ashamed.” Whatever he would have said next was interrupted by a joyful shout.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf!<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Bilbo walked towards them and before he was fully in earshot Gandalf said quietly “I won’t stand between you two.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Do not prove me wrong again.” And with those ominous words Gandalf brushed past him to greet Bilbo properly.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They returned to the party and Thorin forgot Gandalf’s words entirely.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Thorin would only think to consider this prediction when Gandalf reappeared over fifty years later.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>To the author’s knowledge Glamdring remains in the ownership of Gandalf the White to this day, while Orcrist was taken up by Thorin Oakenshield himself.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Baggins arrived back in the Shire even more fantastically rich than when he had left and in the company of a wizard – widely assumed to be Gandalf the Grey – and in a poor state of health according to a letter from Holman Greenhand, Baggins’ gardener at the time, to Hobbiton’s Doctor.<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>He didn’t even know why so many hobbits were defiant towards Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Every time Gandalf came, a dozen young hobbits would follow him everywhere he went, but to Bilbo, it seemed that Gandalf had a particular interest in him.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Gandalf…”, the older hobbit realized.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Indeed, Gandalf was there, waving at him, the usual sparkle twinkling in his eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>His breath got caught in his throat as he felt a hand on his shoulder but he relaxed once he recognised Gandalf's touch.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf took a long look at Bilbo and, when he saw that the fauntling was not replying, he sighed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>The two of them sat there without talking until Gandalf opened his mouth.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf nodded silently, puffing on his pipe.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Maybe Gandalf wanted Bilbo to say something, the young hobbit realized.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>After a while, Gandalf got to his feet and spoke.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>That must have been incredibly boring to Gandalf.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"It's always a pleasure to be with you, Gandalf", the fauntling said truthfully.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>"I will be back", Gandalf promised.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And Gandalf hadn't come back.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>And Gandalf hadn't come back.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Ten years later, Bilbo had stopped waiting for Gandalf.<|endoftext|>


<|endoftext|>“I mislike the touch of them,” Thorin said, losing no chance for bitterness whenever he had not also need—but Bilbo, wide-eyed and curious, leaned so far forward that Gandalf thought he might tilt head over hairy heels.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf shook himself; the sight of the blades in moonlight had briefly made him Olórin again.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“That doesn’t matter.” Gandalf tapped a finger against Glamdring’s pommel.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sighed.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf was fast learning that Kili was the bolder of the two young dwarves.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>“Quite brave,” Gandalf said.<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Gandalf sees that Orcrist is laid on Thorin’s breast.<|endoftext|>
